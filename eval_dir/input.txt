Around midnight on April 15, 1912, there were a few minutes when Capt. Edward Smith of the Titanic realized his ship was going down -- six watertight compartments breached, less than two hours to float -- yet his passengers slept in happy ignorance. A historical fate hardened while most of the participants dreamed on.</br></br>The jobs report last week opened a long gash beneath the waterline of President Obama's legislative agenda. Few realize it, but a scramble for lifeboats is about to begin.</br></br>On closer inspection, the economic news, which seemed bad, is even worse. Not only did unemployment rise to 9.5 percent but wages fell, undermining the consumption needed to revive a consumption-driven economy. Unemployment increased among "breadwinners" -- married men and women who head households -- also making major family purchases more difficult. Recent increases in unemployment benefits and food stamps have helped many Americans pay for food and rent. Jobs, however, are what lead to the purchase of furniture, cars and homes. Paired with a decline in business investment, these trends make a second-half recovery less likely.</br></br>The stimulus package hasn't been very stimulating -- as many economists predicted. Pouring money into the economy through a thirsty sponge of federal programs -- the preferred method of Congress -- is slow and inefficient. In retrospect, all of the stimulus funds should have been given to individuals directly from the tap.</br></br>Obama's spending ambitions would have been jaw-dropping even in the best of economic times. Federal spending this year is about 28 percent of gross domestic product -- a figure exceeded only when Franklin Roosevelt was fighting a global war against Germany and Japan. Along the fiscal path Obama has chosen (according to the Congressional Budget Office) our national debt will more than double in 10 years and will amount to 82 percent of the entire economy.
Shares of Media Vision Technology Inc., a once-highflying maker of video and sound accessories for computers, fell 48.8% after the company said it expects to post a "substantial loss" for the first quarter.</br></br>The loss will stem partly from reducing prices on certain of its retail products in response to aggressive price-cutting by the competition.</br></br>The Fremont, Calif., company also said shipment of one of its new multimedia products would be delayed into the second quarter, resulting in a significant drop in revenue for the first quarter.</br></br>The company would not comment beyond a terse news release, which provided no details on which products were involved in the price cuts or shipment delay. Paul Jain, president and chief executive officer, was not available for comment.</br></br>The slide to $11 a share, down $10.50 Nasdaq Stock Market trading, came after Media Vision shares had already tumbled precipitously in recent weeks, following the release of fourth-quarter results showing a growing backlog of unsold products. The one-time Wall Street darling had seen its share value rocket to a December high of $43.75 from $20.25 when it first went public in 1992. From its zenith, Media Vision has lost about $500 million in market capitalization.

Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- The dollar suffered a broad-based setback after signs that inflationary pressures remain modest curtailed hopes that the Federal Reserve would move aggressively to raise interest rates.</br></br>The dollar's selloff was sparked by the release of a May consumer- price index that came mostly in line with expectations. While the overall CPI registered the biggest monthly jump in 31/2 years, rising 0.6%, the more closely watched core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.2%. Expectations were for a 0.5% gain in the headline number, with a 0.2% rise in core prices.</br></br>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan threw even more cold water on speculation that U.S. rates were headed sharply higher when he played down the risk of inflation. The Fed chief, testifying in front of the Senate Banking Committee on his nomination to a fifth term as chairman, said the central bank's "general view is that inflationary pressures are not likely to be a serious concern in the period ahead."</br></br>Thus, Mr. Greenspan said, he still expects to be able to lift interest rates at a "measured" pace this year, though he reaffirmed that the Fed is prepared to raise rates more aggressively if necessary.
On Aug. 3, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson sent a message to Congress in which he said that the United States could not continue to fight a war in Vietnam and at the same time continue his Great Society programs without, among other things, raising taxes. George Bush ought to read that message. It was titled "The Hard and Inescapable Facts."</br></br>For Bush, facts are neither hard nor inescapable. He believes in "magical math" -- a firm understanding that somehow, in some way, something will happen to make everything come out right in the end. This is the economics practiced by the dreamy who think that today's credit card purchase will never come due. This, in a nutshell, is the financial blueprint for the United States of America.</br></br>For Johnson, the realization that bills come due came too late. Early on he said, "We can continue the Great Society while we fight in Vietnam," but he sensed -- canny pol that he was -- that the American people would pay for the former but not, if they had to choose, the latter. When Johnson finally had to ask for a tax increase, he was on his way out as president. Less than a year after delivering his message about hard facts, he had to face the hardest one himself: He announced he would not seek reelection.</br></br>Bush, having won a second term, cannot seek reelection and so he may never become politically accountable for his mismanagement of the nation's finances. As Johnson initially attempted, Bush is telling the American people they can have both guns and butter -- two for the price of one. In Bush's case, "guns" is the war in Iraq (and Afghanistan) and the "butter" is domestic programs such as enriched Medicare along with the war on terrorism, which Bush himself has characterized as virtually endless. In his case, though, he has not only refused to raise taxes, he has actually lowered them. LBJ could only marvel.</br></br>Ever since the war in Iraq went from resplendent victory ("Mission Accomplished") to the ugly quagmire it has become (almost 2,000 American dead), commentators have been making comparisons to Vietnam. I myself have done that -- and I think certain commonalities exist and are troublesome. Usually, these comparisons focus on military or political matters, but Robert D. Hormats, a former assistant secretary of state and now a vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, has found what may be a more apt comparison. Initially, both wars were financed on the cheap because interest rates were low.
After a bad day on the job as a Border Patrol agent, Eddie DeLaCruz went home and began discussing with his wife how to celebrate her upcoming birthday. Then he casually pressed his government-issued handgun under his chin and pulled the trigger.</br></br>"It was the ugliest sound I ever heard in my life," his widow, Toni DeLaCruz, recalled of that day last November. "He just collapsed." A month later, one of DeLaCruz's colleagues at the Fort Hancock border post shot himself, too.</br></br>Suicides such as these have set off alarms throughout the agency responsible for policing the nation's borders. After nearly four years without a single suicide in its ranks, the Border Patrol has had at least 15 agents take their own lives since February 2008.</br></br>It's unclear why the agents killed themselves. Few of them left notes. And the agency seems somewhat at odds with itself over the issue.</br></br>Federal officials insist that the deaths have nothing to do with the Border Patrol, which has doubled in size since 2004, or the increasingly volatile U.S.-Mexican border. But administrators have quietly undertaken urgent suicide-prevention initiatives, including special training for supervisors, videos about warning signs and educational programs for 22,000 agents nationwide.
Rates on 30-year mortgages fell to the lowest level on record for the second consecutive week after the Federal Reserve launched a new effort to assist the U.S. housing market.</br></br>Mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Thursday that average rates on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages dropped to 4.78 percent this week from 4.85 percent last week.</br></br>It was the lowest in the history of Freddie Mac's survey, which dates to 1971. Rates are down by more than a full percentage point from a year ago.</br></br>"Mortgage rates followed other interest rates lower this week amid reports of slower economic growth" Frank E. Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist, said in a prepared statement.</br></br>Low rates have sparked a surge in refinancing activity. The Mortgage Bankers Association said Wednesday that its weekly application index climbed 3 percent for the week ended March 27, on top of a 30 percent increase a week earlier. Nearly 80 percent of applications came from borrowers seeking to refinance.
Here is something investors haven't heard for a while: Coca-Cola stock is cheap.</br></br>Calling a megacapitalization blue chip trading at 38 times earnings cheap is heresy to many investors. But the fact that many strategists and even some conservative investors can now make that argument shows how the lowest interest rates in nearly two years are transforming the stock-valuation landscape.</br></br>Standard & Poor's 500-stock index trades at 23.54 times the past 12 months' earnings, not far from a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose 28.35 to 7823.13 on Friday, is at 20.10 times earnings. Yet some strategists argue the combination of falling interest rates and still-robust earnings forecasts suggests stocks are a better value than they have been in a long time, including many high P/E blue chips like Coke.</br></br>Again, this may be a surprise to investors still jittery after the Oct. 27 stock plunge and the gyrations in global markets since then. And the same lower-rate scenario that supports the bullish argument also makes the stock market more vulnerable to higher rates than it has been in some time. But here is the bullish case:</br></br>Lower interest rates raise the present value of a company's future earnings. That is because an investor puts a higher price on future earnings if he or she will earn less in competing investments, like bonds. Furthermore, the effect accelerates the lower rates go. A drop in bond yields from 7% to 6% boosts valuations far more than the drop from 8% to 7%, a dynamic long understood by bond investors but not widely appreciated by stock investors.
8 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A Federal-aid mcdical-assistance-forï¿½ï¿½the -aged program that recession-hit West Virginia pioneered two years ago hovered on financial and other rocks today.</br></br>With State funds appropriated to match Federal Kerr-Mills aid running out, only a handful of the Stateï¿½Ûªs doctors have agreed to accept lower fees for services to West Virginians over 65. And only 23 of 108 hospitals originally under the plan remain in after maximum daily service charges were cut from $35 to $20.</br></br>The resistance of physicians and hospitals to the cutbacks dictated Dec. 1 has brought second looks at the program.</br></br>The president of the West Virginia State Medical Association called for doctors to resolve differences with the State Welfare Department as a means of fighting off ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½socialized medicine.ï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª</br></br>Dr. D. E. Greeneltch of Wheeling said that failure of the Kerr-Mills program in West Virginia could very well trigger passage in the new Congress of proposed legislation putting medical care under Social Security.
NEW YORK, Sept. 9 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market drifted lower in a quiet session today as traders awaited the Federal Reserves weekly report on the money supply.</br></br>But hopes ran high on Wall Street for a livelier showing by the market early next week al ter the Fed figures came out, showing another surprise drop in the niohey supply. The news touched off a strong rally in after-hours trading in the bond market.</br></br>The Dow dopes average of 30 industrials dropped 0.40 points to 1,239.74, cutting its gain for the week to 24.29 points.</br></br>After the stock market closed in New York, the Federal Reserve issued statistics showing a $2 billion drop in the basic measure of the money supply, known as Ml, for the latest reporting week.</br></br>That contrasted with advance estimates of a nearly $1 billion increase, and gave new impetus to hopes for a looser credit policy at the Fed and lower interest rates.
Inside the church, 16 well-dressed professionals are meeting. Eight hold advanced degrees; six speak more than one language. All are jobless.</br></br>They are part of the Georgetown Career Support Group and they are discussing the ways and means of looking for work. "How do you convince {potential employers} that you really don't want to be the boss anymore?" asks Michele Saranovich, a former nuclear energy policy adviser. "Believe me, I've down-scaled my re'sume'."</br></br>Seven years ago, Georgetown's was one of a handful of local unemployment support groups; today it is one of the oldest in continuous operation.Around the Beltway, around 20 groups have sprouted, many of them in the last year. They provide a place for people who are out of work to meet, exchange ideas and network. Perhaps more important, they provide a place for the unemployed to comfort each other.</br></br>"Job hunting is kind of a lonely occupation," says Lee Horsey, who attends Work Seekers, a support group that meets in space provided by Chevy Chase bookstore Politics & Prose. "It's easy to get off track. The group helps me get back on track."</br></br>Horsey, 45, worked as support staff for the Foreign Service for nearly 20 years before returning to school to earn an MBA from Georgetown University. Since graduating last May, however, she has been unable to find work."I feel really energized being with those intelligent, qualified people for two hours every week," says Horsey, who learned about Work Seekers from a friend and has been attending since November. "It really does help."
Talk about nervous. The economy merely flexes some long-unused muscles and investors fall all over themselves heading for the exits.</br></br>No doubt about it, the economy is putting on a modest show of strength. Cars and houses are selling better, shoppers are loosening their purse strings and more people are being put to work. If this keeps up, economists predict, the economy will grow at an annual rate of between 3% and 4% in the current quarter, the best since a burst of growth in the last quarter of 1992.</br></br>But with long-term bond prices at lofty levels, interest rates at their lowest since the Treasury began selling 30-year bonds in 1977, and stock prices near record highs, early evidence of renewed growth seemed like the last thing investors wanted to see last week. To some it conjured up visions of tight supplies of goods and services, rising prices, and a Federal Reserve only too willing to fight inflation by raising interest rates to slow an overheating economy.</br></br>The result: a startling weeklong sell-off in the bond market and a two-day plunge in stock prices. Suddenly interest rates were rising and stocks looked as if they were teetering on the edge of a bear market.</br></br>"What is so amazing to me is that market psychology turned so quickly on such a small pickup in growth," marvels Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International.
NEW YORK, May 22 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Some of the red hot mineral issues cooled off today as the Stock Market went through a mixed session with selective gains by blue chips late in the day. Trading slackened.</br></br>Texas Gulf Sulphur resumed its role as the most active stock, losing % at 54% on 297,800 ssares as additional profits were taken.</br></br>Yesterdayï¿½Ûªs hero in the current vogue for national resource discoveries, Occidental Petroleum, slipped to second most active and lost 1% at 31% on 162,000 shares.</br></br>A selective return to some of the blue chips in late trading was the opposite side of the coin as profits cashed on speculative gains were put into higher quality issues.</br></br>International Harvester rose 2, Caterpillar 1, IBM 2, Eastman Kodak 1% and Standard Oil (New Jersey) %.
From Minnesota to Alabama, battered regional banks are warning that a turnaround from the economic malaise is nowhere in sight.</br></br>A series of large regional banks reported Tuesday that rising losses from bad loans plagued first-quarter results. That is forcing major institutions such as U.S. Bancorp and Regions Financial Corp. to put more money aside to fortify against more defaults.</br></br>The results showed how widespread the damage is as banks of all sizes pay a steep price for extending credit to shaky borrowers when times were good. Banks throughout the U.S. are feeling the pain, telling investors that a protracted recession means the situation will get worse before it gets better.</br></br>"No significant turnaround will occur this year," said Huntington Bancshares Inc. Chief Executive Stephen Steinour after the Columbus, Ohio, bank posted a $2.43 billion quarterly loss, or $6.79 a share, compared with year-earlier profit of $127.1 million, or 35 cents a share. Huntington took a nearly $300 million credit-loss provision as it faces potential losses from commercial loans.</br></br>The tight credit environment makes it more difficult for consumer and business borrowers to pay their debts. Falling stock markets and rising unemployment also demonstrate the depth of the economic stress, regional bank CEOs said.
ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co.'s chairman and chief executive sees a U.S. economy that is slowing slightly but still has the fuel for "reasonable growth."</br></br>Inflation is essentially mute, raw-materials costs are steady and "I don't think we're going to see any negative numbers" domestically any time soon, Livio D. "Desi" DeSimone said.</br></br>The company's internal forecast is for domestic economic growth of about 2% in the second half. Characterizing the U.S. economy as "stratified," Mr. DeSimone said in an interview that the company expects some "laggard areas" to perk up in coming months. "They won't have to do a whole lot better in construction and automotive to have an improvement," he said, adding that "I think the health-care industry might do a little better."</br></br>The company is a major supplier of abrasives and fasteners to the automotive and construction industries and sells a wide range of items to the medical community. Because it does business in so many sectors of the economy, 3M sometimes is considered a bellwether for American industry.</br></br>Still, nearly 55% of its $14.2 billion in 1996 sales were overseas, and Mr. DeSimone called the impact of foreign exchange on earnings "the single biggest hit we have." In the first quarter, currency translation reduced net income by five cents a share, to 99 cents, or $410 million, on sales of $3.7 billion.
Despite a decade of technological advances that make it possible to work almost anywhere, many of the nation's most educated people continue to cluster in a handful of dominant metropolitan areas such as Boston, New York and California's Silicon Valley, according to census data released Thursday.</br></br>The upshot is that regions with the most skilled and highly paid workers continue to widen their advantages over less well-endowed locales.</br></br>"In a knowledge economy, success breeds success," said Alan Berube, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.</br></br>Of the largest 100 metropolitan areas, those with the highest percentage of college graduates in 2000 outpaced in education gains areas with lower percentages of college grads. For instance, the 10 cities with the highest share of their population holding a bachelor's degree or higher saw that share jump by an average of 4.6 percentage points over the decade, while the bottom 10 saw their share grow 3.1 percentage points.</br></br>Those higher-educated areas also tend to be the highest-earning. In the San Francisco metro area, where 43% of adult residents have a college degree or higher, the median household income stands at $73,027. Nationwide, 28.2% of people aged 25 and older have a college degree, and the median household income is $50,046.
WASHINGTON -- The decision of West and East Germany to begin talks as early as next week on a common currency may only add to Alan Greenspan's problems.</br></br>The prospect of swifter German monetary and economic integration is likely to lead to greater upward pressure -- at least in the short-term -- on German and even U.S. interest rates, economists say, because of increased fears of higher inflation in West Germany. Such pressure on U.S. rates would be compounded by the tight monetary policy of Japan's new central bank governor, Yasushi Mieno.</br></br>That is a disappointment for the Bush administration, which in recent weeks has tried unsuccessfully to jawbone the Federal Reserve Board into cutting short-term U.S. interest rates.</br></br>"Inflationary pressures will come up somewhat {in Germany}; it will be difficult for German interest rates in the short term," said Werner Becker, an economist at Deutsche Bank's Frankfurt headquarters, discussing the outlook for his country's interest rates in the light of next week's meeting on monetary union. "There will be a certain pressure on the dollar exchange rate and even on the interest rates," Mr. Becker added.</br></br>In testimony to a congressional panel late last month, Fed Chairman Greenspan said that rising interest rates in Europe and Japan are causing significant amounts of capital to be diverted from the U.S. The results of this diversion are clear in the bond market. "We're seeing some pressure in the longer end of the {U.S.} bond market," Mr. Greenspan said. The U.S. needs foreign capital to finance its large current-account and federal budget deficits.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average took what was shaping up as a down day and turned it into a triumph, climbing to its highest closing level on record.</br></br>The advance came as Circuit City Stores was pounded after issuing earnings, Oracle faltered on its results, but Morgan Stanley rose after posting a record profit.</br></br>The Dow industrials rose 30.05 points, or 0.24%, to 12471.32, its third record close in four sessions. The industrials had been off nearly 44 points and then mounted a midafternoon comeback.</br></br>The Nasdaq Composite Index, affected by software maker Oracle and semiconductor softness, dropped 6.02, or 0.25%, to 2429.55. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 3.07, or 0.22%, to 1425.55.</br></br>The market still has an upward bias, said David Klaskin, chief investment officer at Oak Ridge Investments. "A lot of investment managers are still sitting on a relatively high level of cash and are using signs of weakness as an opportunity to buy."
The chairman of the House Banking Committee -yesterday charged Arthur F. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, with improprieties in lobbying against a bill which would require a government audit of the Fedï¿½Ûªs operations.</br></br>Rep. Wright Patman (D-Tex.) said in a letter to Burns that he understood the Fed chairman contacted a bank lobbying group ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½to enlist their support against the bill.ï¿½Û He said he questioned ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the propriety of the Federal Reserve Board chairman, as a bank regulator, engaging in such activities.ï¿½Û</br></br>In a quick reply to Patman, Burns denied that he had ever contacted a bank lobbying organization. *T hasten to add, however, that I certainly have not discouraged people who 'share my concern about your proposal from making their viewsï¿½Û known.</br></br>The organization in question is the American Bankers Association, which represents nearly all of the 13,-000 commercial banks in the country.</br></br>An ABA official said last night that the initial contact between the Fed and the bankers came after a press conference in Chicago on Oct. 7 in which then ABA president Eugene H.
In my last two articles, I examined the Federal Reserve Board's proposals for tightening mortgage underwriting requirements and for limiting mortgage broker charges to borrowers. These are long-standing regulatory concerns.</br></br>In contrast, the Fed seems to have discovered mortgage servicing abuses only recently. The regulatory proposals are weak, but they are a good first step.</br></br>One proposal would require that servicers credit payments on the days payments are received. Another would require servicers to provide accurate payoff statements within a reasonable time to borrowers who intend to pay off their loans. Both are fair, clear and not onerous for the lender.</br></br>A third proposal would prohibit servicers from imposing late fees or delinquency charges when scheduled payments are received on time but do not include previous late charges. This rule would eliminate the practice of "pyramiding late fees," in which servicers continue to charge late fees until all previous late fees have been paid.</br></br>But the proposal does not cover a worse type of pyramiding. When a scheduled payment is received on time but the escrow payment is short, the practice is to place the entire payment in a suspense account, charge the borrower a late fee and send a delinquency notice to the credit bureaus.
FRANKFURT -- As Deutsche Bank AG mops up the mess of a spate of financial scandals, it's expected easily to overcome the balance-sheet damage caused by large loan losses.</br></br>Other wounds will take longer to heal.</br></br>In the string of calamities that has hit Germany's banking system over the past months, from Metallgesellschaft AG's losses on trading in oil-based derivatives to the collapse of the Juergen Schneider AG real estate group, Deutsche Bank has lost a lot more than just money. It has become a butt of jokes and criticism that have caused a damaging dent to its prestige, helping to push down its share price by more than 10% since the end of March, compared with a 3% fall in Germany's DAX stock-market index.</br></br>"They have lost the trust and belief that people had in Deutsche Bank," says Manfred Piontke, an analyst at Bank Julius Baer (Deutschland) AG. "They have lost a lot of their image."</br></br>In a bid to regain public confidence, Deutsche Bank yesterday unveiled plans to tighten its controls on lending to the real estate sector. It also announced the departure of two more senior executives implicated in the Schneider debacle.
The stock market was rather ho-hum in 1992, but Wall Street's cast of characters did its darnedest to stir things up. As usual, the Journal kept track of the year's more ludicrous moments in investing. Some highlights:</br></br>Advertising Rule: Know Your Audience</br></br>As if Wall Street didn't already have problems with sexism, a Wall Street-area topless club bought a large advertisement right in the center of the Nasdaq stock listings in the New York Post. Stockbrokers are "an excellent audience for us," explains Tom Peraza, marketing director of New York Dolls. One reason, he says: They know "a good value."</br></br>One Nasdaq executive said that at least it shows the market's listings are the place to be.</br></br>Dan Quayle's Excellent Adventure on Wall Street
The Dow industrials and S&P 500 clinched fresh all-time highs after the nominee to head the Federal Reserve defended the central bank's economic stimulus efforts, though weak earnings from Cisco Systems hurt technology stocks.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 54.59 points, or 0.3%, to 15876.22, while the S&P 500 gained 8.62 points, or 0.5%, to 1790.62. Both indexes ended at record levels for a second consecutive day. The Nasdaq Composite Index added 7.16 points, or 0.2%, to 3972.74, its highest finish in more than 13 years.</br></br>Investors focused on Fed Vice Chairwoman Janet Yellen, President Barack Obama's nominee to lead the central bank after Ben Bernanke steps down in January, for signals about Fed policy.</br></br>Ms. Yellen said in a hearing on her nomination before the Senate Banking Committee that there are dangers to ending the central bank's $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program too soon, an assurance to investors that few big policy changes are on the way. The Fed's bond-buying program is widely credited for helping to enable the S&P 500's 26% gain in 2013.</br></br>"In her first test before the Senate she's come across clear and concise and saying what we expected," said Yousef Abbasi, New York-based market strategist at brokerage JonesTrading Institutional Services.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices surged yesterday as the government completed a massive $17 billion borrowing operation that drew an enthusiastic response from investors.</br></br>Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds rose by almost a point, or nearly $10 for each $1,000 face amount. In the past two sessions, these issues have regained about one-third of the losses suffered in the previous five days. Interest rates on short-term Treasury bills declined yesterday.</br></br>The Treasury yesterday sold $4.51 billion of new 20-year, one-month bonds at an average annual yield of 10.75%. That was down from 12.04% at the previous auction held March 28. The Treasury received a total of $13.53 billion of bids. That was up sharply from $10.7 billion received at the March auction, when $4.26 billion of bonds were sold.</br></br>The bond sale was the third and final part of the government's financing. The Treasury sold $6.54 billion of new four-year notes Tuesday at an average annual yield of 9.72% and $6.02 billion of new seven-year notes Wednesday at an average yield of 10.4%.</br></br>The Federal Reserve System late yesterday reported a $1.5 billion decline in the nation's money supply for the week ended June 17. But the decline, which was the first following six weekly increases, had been widely anticipated and had little effect on bond prices. Even with the decline, the basic money supply, known as M1, remains far above the Fed's target range, which calls for 4% to 7% growth this year.
American Express Co. has for more than a year been secretly financing a newsletter that criticizes the interest rates charged by competing bank credit cards.</br></br>Bank Credit Card Observer, a frequently quoted publication produced in Kendall Park, N.J., has receivedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and will continue to receive until yearendï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a subsidy "likely to approach $500,000,ï¿½Û according to the American Banker, a trade publication that broke the story yesterday.</br></br>American Express began financing the newsletter a few months before it launched its own lower-interest Optima credit card to compete with MasterCard and Visa. The newsletterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ like several similar publicationsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½has given editorial credit to Optima for helping to drive down credit card interest rates.</br></br>American Express and John C. Pollock, the newsletter's publisher, yesterday confirmed the arrangement but declined to discuss the exact amount involved. Pollock acknowledged that he is getting a monthly grant of $20,000 from American Express.</br></br>Colleagues in the consumer credit and journalism fields expressed shock and dismay at the American Express link to Bank Credit Card Observer, although many defended the newsletterï¿½Ûªs contents.
JAPANESE FIRMS' PRODUCTIVITY</br></br>Japanese corporations' productivity lags behind their U.S. counterparts in terms of purchasing-power parity, the Japan Productivity Center said in its latest survey. This parity compares the amount of goods that can be bought for a certain amount of money.</br></br>Average productivity in all Japanese industries, or gross domestic product per employee, was less than that in the U.S., France, the former West Germany, and Britain. The U.S. surpassed Japan in productivity by 31%. The figures are for 1988, the latest available.</br></br>In forestry and fisheries, the U.S. was more than three times as productive as Japan. Japan almost equaled France in manufacturing but was outpaced by the U.S. and Britain.</br></br>Japan had the advantage only in the electric power, natural gas and water supply industries. It fell behind the U.S. in commerce, transportation, warehousing and communications.

Shelby (R-Ala.) will review the Federal Reserve Bank's role in overseeing a small California bank suspected of being a possible conduit in the mid-1990s for illegal Chinese political contributions. Shelby, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, already has said he will review if another federal bank regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, was negligent in its oversight of the bank, the Far East National Bank of Los Angeles. The Fed approved the sale of the bank to a foreign bank in Taiwan in June 1997, the same month the Fed knew the OCC was notifying the Justice Department and other criminal investigators of the bank's activities.</br></br>Cox Communications agreed to buy TCA Cable TV for about $4 billion in stock, cash and assumed debt, moving to become the fourth-largest company in the rapidly consolidating U.S. cable television industry. TCA has 883,000 subscribers, mainly in Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. Cox -- which last month agreed to buy Media General's cable systems for $1.4 billion -- and many of its competitors have been on an acquisition spree in the past year, seeking to build larger regional groups of subscribers to spread out the cost of new programming and digital services such as high-speed Internet access and local telephone service.</br></br>Bank fraud charges were filed against 33 people in federal court in Manhattan for using false papers to apply for more than $35 million in loans from Citibank, Chase Manhattan and five other banks. The defendants, mostly small-business owners, got the bogus documents from a former NatWest Bank loan officer who has already pleaded guilty. U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the banks actually lent out about $20 million based on the papers and lost $10 million to $15 million.</br></br>Avondale Industries said its board has authorized management to begin talks with Litton Industries over Litton's $500 million cash offer to purchase the New Orleans shipyard. Litton has made twin, unsolicited offers for Avondale and Newport News Shipbuilding, which also has an offer pending for Avondale. While Litton is offering cash for Avondale, Newport News has offered its stock in a bid valued at about $470 million. Newport News has not publicly responded to the bid from Litton.</br></br>Insight Communications said it plans to raise more than $500 million through an initial public offering of Class A common stock. The cable TV system operator did not disclose the number of shares or estimated price range in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It plans to use proceeds from the IPO to acquire systems in Kentucky, introduce new and enhanced products and services and invest in a telephone venture with AT&T.
NEW YORK -- Stocks rallied in an old-fashioned reaction to declining interest rates and strong earnings reports.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.95, or 1%, to 2905.45. At its peak, the industrial average was up about 50 points. New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 196,570,000 shares, the strongest in a week. Advancing issues swamped decliners, 1,108 to 508.</br></br>Short-term interest rates tumbled yesterday as investors began to anticipate another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board. They were encouraged by Thursday's weak inflation and retail sales reports. The producer price index for March slipped 0.3%, while the core of the index, minus food and energy prices, added only 0.2%. Retail sales in March fell 0.8%.</br></br>Many analysts believe the data give the Fed an opportunity to lower rates while maintaining its anti-inflationary stance. Some expect the Fed to act today if the slowing producer inflation numbers are confirmed by evidence of moderating consumer price increases. The consumer price index will be released at 8:30 a.m. EDT.</br></br>"It is amazing how the mentality on the Street is changing so rapidly," asserted Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co. "The numbers came out and everybody who was gloom and doom wants" to own stocks.
Manufacturing growth slowed sharply in July, undercutting an industrial rebound that had given many economists confidence in the broader economic recovery.</br></br>The Institute of Supply Management's index of manufacturing activity dropped to 50.5 for July from 56.2 a month earlier. The July reading, the lowest since January, suggests the manufacturing sector continued to grow, but just barely. A reading below 50 implies contraction in the sector.</br></br>Particularly disturbing in the July report was a sharp drop in an index of new orders, an indicator of future activity. The index, which had been suggesting a healthy growth in orders, posted its largest monthly drop since October, implying orders are now flat.</br></br>For many weeks, economists cited the manufacturing rebound as evidence the economy could continue to recover, despite growing uncertainty created by accounting scandals, falling stock prices and an uneven profit outlook. Overall industrial output increased for six straight months through June, according to the Federal Reserve. But uncertainty appeared to take its toll on manufacturers in July. It might just be a temporary pause, but, coming on the heels of weak economic-growth data, the news will heighten worries the recovery is in jeopardy.</br></br>"Some [supply executives] indicate that business is improving, but question whether it will continue," the report said. "Others are experiencing declines and question if we have hit the bottom." The index was based on responses from 280 executives who handle purchasing activity in industries ranging from textiles to electronics to steel. Many of the executives cited budget cuts, plans to move production to cheaper locations abroad and concerns about the outlook for the rest of the year.
One of the largest utility acquisitions in Massachusetts is supposed to provide a jolt to the economy.</br></br>Shock is more like it, to hear the business community tell it.</br></br>BEC Energy, which owns Boston Edison, said in December that it planned to acquire Commonwealth Energy System, which owns Commonwealth Electric Co., Commonwealth Gas Co. and Cambridge Electric Light Co., for $948 million. BEC Energy is paying a premium of $502 million over the book value of Commonwealth.</br></br>Utility officials say the melding of the two operations would allow them to freeze rates for four years and create substantial operating efficiencies that would save customers billions of dollars.</br></br>But to get there, the utilities want permission from regulators to make customers pay the combined company $959 million over 40 years for costs incurred as part of the acquisition. The utilities propose to collect $34.1 million a year for the first 10 years and $20.6 million annually for the remaining 30 years.
Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, acknowledging that most European countries are disturbed about high U.S. interest rates, said yesterday that this country will continue to pursue a tough monetary policy because ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½you cannot get inflation under control without having high interest rates." But he did offer the hope that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½this is a temporary phenomenon, it will pass.ï¿½Û</br></br>In general, he sought to assure Europe that the United States is sensitive to the impact its economic policies have on Europe. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½After all,ï¿½Û he said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we know that the dollar is a reserve currency, and we know that we have to be responsible in the way</br></br>At a news conference following a meeting with Gaston Thom, president of the European Communities Commission, Regan said that the high level of interest rates here is the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½most obviousï¿½Û of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½trouble spotsï¿½Û to be discussed at a seven-nation economic summit in Ottawa beginning next Sunday.</br></br>But in direct response to European complaints about American policy ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ including those voiced by Thom in Brussels last week ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Regan pointed to insistence by the Europeans themselves at the Venice summit in 1980 that the United States bring inflation under control. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We are determined to get infla-See SUMMIT, E2, Col. 1 tion under control,ï¿½Û Regan said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is one of the main features of President Reaganï¿½Ûªs economic package. You cannot get inflation under control without having high interest rates. This is one of the side-effects.</br></br>In saying that, I hope you notice that Iï¿½Ûªm not saying that high interest rates are a weapon that the United States is using against its partners or anything else. Itï¿½Ûªs a result of supply and demand for money.ï¿½Û
After years of bickering with Japan over specific trade disputes, the Bush administration decided last July to try a new approach-a frontal assault on "Japan Inc.," the tightly knit Japanese business practices and economic policies that U.S. trade officials believe give Tokyo much of its competitive edge in the world.</br></br>This new approach, the first time two sovereign nations have tried through negotiations to pull apart each other's economic systems and demand changes in them, has heightened the tense trade relationship between the United States and Japan to a new pitch following President Bush's personal intervention in talks with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu in February.</br></br>This week, the negotiations reach a crucial point. U.S. officials said the results of a preliminary report on the negotiations, to be drafted during two days of talks in Washington beginning tomorrow, will determine whether the Bush administration orders trade sanctions against Japan that could double import taxes on selected Japanese products.</br></br>Administration officials appear united on the need to retaliate if the preliminary report fails to show what U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills called "a constructive blueprint for future action" by Japan to change its internal economy in ways that open the door to significantly more foreign goods and investment.</br></br>Even Hills, whose voice is among the more restrained in the administration on the tendentious Japan trade issue, said this time promises of action will not be enough. She said there will have to be "a sufficient down payment to show the American people there is real ... resolve" to open Japan to more foreign goods and investments.
WASHINGTON -- Worker productivity in nonfarm businesses edged up at a 0.1% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the Labor Department said in revisions of an earlier report that said the figure was unchanged.</br></br>Productivity, or output for each hour of work, climbed at an annual rate of 2% in the third quarter and dropped at a 2.4% rate in the second.</br></br>The department estimated that productivity for all businesses, including farms, declined at a 2% annual rate in the fourth quarter, the same as originally reported. A drop in farm output stemming from last summer's drought was largely responsible.</br></br>Growth in productivity is critical to the economy if it is to continue expanding without inflation.</br></br>Unit labor costs increased at an annual rate of 5.6% in the fourth quarter, as the department initially calculated, after increasing at a 3.7% annual rate in the third quarter and a 6.8% annual rate in the second.
BEIJING -- China's big insurance companies, gearing up to list outside the mainland, will give investors a chance to buy into one of the world's fastest-growing insurance markets. Even as the companies ride a flood of new premiums, they must grapple with the impact of nonperforming investments and high-interest obligations.</br></br>The top three insurance companies -- China Life Insurance, People's Insurance Company of China and Ping An Insurance -- are scrambling to be the first of their number to issue shares abroad, most likely in Hong Kong and possibly in the U.S. While the companies declined to provide details of the planned initial public offerings, industry executives say China Life and Ping An want to raise $1 billion to $2 billion each and People's Insurance less than $500 million. Some of the IPOs could take place as early as the first half of the year.</br></br>The offerings will give investors an entree into China's dynamic insurance market, which saw revenues from premiums surge nearly 50% in 2002 over the previous year. That is even as other insurers world-wide were battered by the worst stock-market decline in three decades, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the U.S. But while Chinese insurers may be enjoying booming growth, they face their own set of challenges as they prepare for listing. These include high ratios of nonperforming assets, tight government restrictions on investments and increased foreign competition as China opens its market under World Trade Organization rules.</br></br>"People are attracted by China's growth, but the companies face typical China problems of poor governance, disclosure and weak management," says Fred Hu, a managing director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong. "How successful the IPOs will be will depend on whether the companies will really be able to turn a new leaf." (Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which with Morgan Stanley and HSBC Holdings PLC have a combined 24% stake in Ping An, is likely to be a lead underwriter in Ping An's planned listing.)</br></br>Many Chinese insurers are burdened by troubled assets, including speculative property investments made in the late 1980s through 1995, when Beijing banned such deals. Mr. Hu estimates that nonperforming assets account for 20% to 30% of Chinese insurers' total investments.
NEW YORK -- Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. on Monday will introduce new indexes from the creator of the VIX "fear gauge" that will track popular stocks' performance against the broader market.</br></br>The stock exchange tapped a duo that includes Robert Whaley, who developed the CBOE Market Volatility Index, to design the new "Alpha Indexes." With regulators' approval, Nasdaq will offer derivatives to bet on or guard against moves in the new measures -- something Mr. Whaley envisions letting investors screen out even a stock-market crash from the returns of popular holdings like Apple Inc. or Citigroup Inc.</br></br>"The idea is to isolate what I'm focused on and get rid of the market bet," said Mr. Whaley, who is a professor at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. The indexes, which Mr. Whaley co-developed with university colleague Jacob Sagi, are to be presented this week at the Futures Industry Association's Futures & Options Expo in Chicago. Nasdaq hopes to launch the derivatives built around the indexes early next year.</br></br>With the severe stock-market gyrations of the financial crisis and this year's "flash crash," interest in vehicles to track volatility and "trade" it with complex derivatives have soared. Stock-market correlation also has shot up, pushing investments often used to hedge or diversify into lock-step with major markets.</br></br>The new Nasdaq products are built for investors seeking to combat those problems by isolating the pure "alpha" of a stock, said Eric Noll, Nasdaq OMX Group's executive vice president of transaction services. Alpha is a stock's outperformance relative to a benchmark.
AFTER DIGESTING THE Federal Reserve's interest-rate increase and parsing its mostly positive comments on the economy, investors exhaled and pushed stocks to their biggest gains in two months.</br></br>As widely expected, the Fed raised the target federal-funds interest rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, one-quarter point to 1.5%. Rattled by softness in recent economic growth, however, traders zeroed in on central-bank comments about the economy.</br></br>Their worry: That recent weakness in job growth and consumer spending would make the Fed question if the economy's recovery was losing steam and ratchet down the pace and scope of promised rate increases at future meetings.</br></br>In its statement the Fed acknowledged recent economic softness, but blamed high energy prices and said the economy "appears poised to resume a stronger pace of expansion going forward." This gave investors little indication that the Fed would deviate from its plan to raise rates at a "measured" pace in coming months.</br></br>Skeptics cautioned that by noting recent weakness, the Fed may have left itself room to hold off on more rate cuts if the economy sputtered. But most investors focused on the positive and read this as a vote of confidence for the economy and more rate increases.
More than usual, iron-ore miners are in a hole. And the Australian dollar hasn't thrown down a rope.</br></br>Benchmark iron-ore prices are now $70 a metric ton, down nearly 50% this year. The largest miners of the steel-making commodity, with the lowest costs, have ramped up supply even as demand from China has waned. Iron ore accounted for about 40% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton in the first six months of the year; at peer Rio Tinto, that figure was nearly 80%.</br></br>Usually, lower prices for Australia's key commodities would go hand in hand with a weaker currency, easing the pain for producers there. The biggest miners price their output and report earnings in U.S. dollars, but their costs for labor, transport and services are denominated in local currency. So a weaker Aussie dollar can effectively reduce costs in U.S.-dollar terms at mines there.</br></br>That hasn't happened this time. The average price of iron ore in the first half of this year was about $110, according to the Steel Index. So far in the second half, it is $86, down about 23%. And while Australia's currency has fallen since early September, on average it has barely budged: Just like in the first half of 2014, one Australian dollar has been worth, on average, US$0.91.</br></br>That makes iron ore's tumble all the tougher. Take Rio Tinto. The miner said in August that a 10% decline in the average iron-ore price would knock about US$1.2 billion off 2014's underlying earnings. But a 10% drop in the Australian dollar would add back about $500 million, mitigating the impact.
Q: Are preferred shares a good investment in this market and are they closer to bonds or stocks?</br></br>A: Preferred shares are complex investments that have similarities to both equities and debt. Preferred shares trade like stocks and are a claim on the assets and earnings of a company, just like common shares. But they hold a higher claim on the assets than common stock. That makes preferreds a somewhat safer investment.</br></br>While preferred shares usually don't have voting rights, they pay a regular dividend that can be substantial, making them similar in some ways to bonds. Dividends paid by preferred shares usually must be paid out before common shareholders receive their dividends.</br></br>"Preferred shares are slightly more like bonds than stocks as their historical price volatility more closely matches that of bonds," says Andrew Zimmerman, chief investment strategist at DT Investment Partners LLC. Just like bonds, they can be called by the issuer in times of falling interest rates, he notes.</br></br>"Since preferred shares are sensitive to interest-rate movements, their prices fall when interest rates rise and vice versa," he says. "However, since they offer such relatively high yields, the income component of preferred shares can help to offset the price decline in periods of small interest-rate spikes."

TOKYO, Jan. 7ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The diligence, quality and productivity of American workers won a ringing endorsement today from an unlikely source: the government of Japan.</br></br>Japan's Ministry of Labor issued a detailed report showing that Americans rate higher in productivity and in buying power per hour of labor than workers in Japan or in the three biggest West European countries.</br></br>"We issued this document on the theory that, if weï¿½Ûªre going to be talking about productivity, we ought to have the objective facts,ï¿½Û said Labor Minister Tetsuo Kondo.</br></br>Over the past three weeks, Japanese politicians have caused a furor in the United States with public comments belittling American industry and workers.</br></br>The Japanese leaders apologized to the United States after their comments were reported in the West. But they were expressing a fairly common view among Japanese politicians.
American investors may be shunning U.S. stock funds these days, but not the Japanese; a record $700 million of Japanese money this week poured into a new U.S. mutual fund.</br></br>The new fund, Nomura Rosenberg Alpha Fund Mark II, is managed by Rosenberg Institutional Equity Management of Orinda, Calif. The firm is run by onetime university professor Barr Rosenberg, known for his highly mathematical approach to stock market investing. Proceeds were raised by Japan's Nomura Securities Co.</br></br>Richard Bartels, a partner at Rosenberg Institutional Equity, said all $700 million was invested Monday through Wednesday, with orders scattered among 35 brokers. Much of that money went into stock-index futures, he said, with the goal of later switching it into individual stocks.</br></br>The Japanese fundholders aren't outright bullish about the U.S., though. Although the fund will be fully invested in U.S. equities, its dollar currency exposure can be hedged by Nomura against the yen. Perhaps influenced by the dollar's more than 50% plunge against the yen over the past three years, the fund is starting out with 60% of its holdings protected against a drop in the dollar.</br></br>Japanese investors have invested plenty of money in U.S. equities in the past few years. But most of that has been done by Japanese insurance companies or trust banks, rather than by U.S. advisers of any kind, particularly mutual-fund managers.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>Chad and Erica Dryden have been late a couple of times on mortgage payments due to patchy income flows. A U.S. News article on Wednesday about the steadying of U.S. incomes incorrectly said the couple had missed mortgage payments.</br></br>(WSJ Septermber 19, 2013)</br></br>American incomes are no longer free-falling -- but they're not rising, either.</br></br>The income of the typical U.S. family stabilized last year for the first time since the recession, according to the Census Bureau's latest snapshot of U.S. living standards, released Tuesday. The levelling off follows four years of declines that pushed incomes to their lowest levels in nearly two decades.
When Bush administration budget director Richard G. Darman came before Congress for confirmation last year, he said that defining a tax increase was like recognizing a duck: If it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it is a duck.</br></br>Yesterday, Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) reexamined Darman in an effort to explore whether there was any room for compromise in the "no new taxes" pledge Bush made during his election campaign. Darman told the Joint Economic Committee that the administration wants to shift away from "the duck test" to "a growth test," suggesting that the White House might be willing to accept a tax increase that would promote economic growth.</br></br>"Let's apply a growth test that would get us out of political vocabulary into an economic vocabulary," Darman said.</br></br>But Darman remained elusive about how much room for compromise that would create. He denied that any tax increase would be rejected as "anti-growth," but when pressed for an example, he only cited the administration's proposed 2 percent user fee on aviation use.</br></br>When Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.) asked how long the "no new taxes" pledge was intended to last, Darman said, "for the time being, forever."
Federal Reserve officials will face at least three sources of economic uncertainty when they gather Tuesday and Wednesday: rising U.S. interest rates, unsettling events abroad and another battle in Washington's long-running budget war.</br></br>All three could restrain the U.S. economy in coming months. The Fed can influence only one of them directly.</br></br>The Fed's assessment of the latest threats will shape its decision about scaling back an $85 billion-a-month bond-buying program that has buoyed markets and key parts of the U.S. economy. That makes the central bank's outlook particularly consequential as the four-year-old recovery again fails to meet the Fed's own projections.</br></br>"It's a very difficult decision for them to make," said BNP Paribas economist Julia Coronado. "They've had a forecast for a pickup in growth. It's not materializing."</br></br>For interest rates -- a factor partly within the Fed's control -- the early evidence could spur caution among policy makers.
NEW YORK, July 8 (AD ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market, happy 8 with the downward course !ï¿½Û¢ of interest rates but not so sure about inflation prospects, settled for a slight gain in an active session today.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks inched up .82 to 91)1.88 after showing a peak reading of plus-3 early in the session.</br></br>Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades In those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, came to 25.06 million shares as of the close in New York.</br></br>The session got off to a strong start amid considerable optimistic talk about the interest rate outlook.</br></br>Short-term rates in the money markets declined for the second day in a row, and there were indications that the Federal Reserve had re- laxed its credit policy a bit. There was additional favorable news for the market at mid day when Ford Motor restored its quarterly dividend to the 80 cents a share It last paid in the first quarter of 1975.
Beijing -- FROM STEAK TO IRON ore to cotton to diamonds, China's rising urban incomes, changing consumer tastes and increased exports are reshaping the world's commodity markets. The country's emergence as a major importer of raw materials is driving global prices higher and catching some suppliers flat-footed.</br></br>Consider the Texan Bar and Grill in Beijing, tucked away in a cavernous Holiday Inn. The waiters wear cowboy hats, boots and blue jeans to serve Beijing diners the restaurant's signature dish: grilled U.S. rib-eye steak. In a sign of the prosperous times in China, a growing number of Chinese can afford a substantial steak lunch, and have developed a substantial taste for one as well. China's beef imports hit record levels last year. And global beef exporters are licking their chops.</br></br>U.S. and Canadian agricultural officials expect China to import 30,000 metric tons of beef next year -- and more than 350,000 tons in 10 years, making China "our No. 1 engine of growth," says Ted Haney, president of the Canada Beef Export Federation.</br></br>Similarly, on a small island near Shanghai, Baogang Steel Group Co., the nation's biggest steel producer, has carved a new deep-water harbor to accommodate huge freighters from Brazil and Australia supplying iron ore, a crucial material used in making the steel for the auto and construction industries. This year, China will import 150 million tons of iron ore, surpassing Japan as the world's largest consumer of the commodity.</br></br>"China has sucked the cupboard bare of raw materials," says Jim Lennon, executive director of commodities research at Macquarie Bank Ltd. in London. Because of its fast growth, Mr. Lennon cautions, China "is starting to place severe strains on the global raw-materials supply chain." Those strains are driving commodity prices sharply higher.
WASHINGTON -- The Reagan administration raised its official forecast of economic growth to 3% for 1988 from the projection of 2.4% it made in February.</br></br>White House economist Beryl Sprinkel said the change reflected significantly stronger growth than expected at the beginning of the year. "Our rosy forecast wasn't rosy enough," he said, chiding congressional critics who complained earlier in the year that the White House forecast was too optimistic.</br></br>The administration acknowledged, however, that interest rates were likely to remain substantially higher than it had previously forecast.</br></br>Mr. Sprinkel said the new numbers were consistent with a revised report from the Commerce Department, also released yesterday, showing first-quarter economic growth at a robust annual rate of 3.6%, after taking account of inflation. An estimate released last month put the growth rate in the "real" gross national product at 3.9%.</br></br>The new forecast will be used to calculate the administration's midyear review of the budget. Mr. Sprinkel said that although the higher-than-expected growth will boost Treasury revenue, higher-than-expected interest rates will increase government spending on debt service. As a result, the new forecast will do little to help reduce the budget deficit.
As the nationï¿½Ûªs booming economic recovery of late spring and early summer slows, The Washington Post takes an in-depth look at the economic health and future of the D.C. area, the nation and the world in the 1983 Fall Economic Review and Preview.</br></br>... The booming economic recovery of late spring and early summer, sparked by an unexpected surge in consumer spending, has slowed and forecasters are uncertain exactly what comes next.</br></br>Retail sales declined in July and August as automobile sales continued to fall short of Detroitï¿½Ûªs hopes. Monthly gains in industrial production are slowing now that sales have flattened, and businesses have begun tq accumulate inventories once more.</br></br>; Housing construction, which began its recovery a year ago, lias hit a plateau, if not a pothole, as a result of higher mortgage interest rates. And a rapidly growing trade deficit is hurting export-oriented industries, as well as those whose products face competition from foreign imports.</br></br>I Slowing is a relative term, however. The spring quarter was extraordinary, with the gross national product, adjusted for inflation, rising at an unsustainable 9.2 percent annual rate. Partly because the level of economic activity at the end of June was considerably higher than the average for the second quarter, forecasts for the current three months generally show at least a 7 percent growth rate, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½-But at the moment, the economy does not appear to be expanding at such a strong rate. From this point forward, the consensus among forecasters calls for fairly steady but modest economic growth through 1984. Inflation is expected to bounce back to somewhere between 5 and 6.5 percent as unemployment falls to between 8 percent and 8.5 percent by late next year.
Gov. Pete Wilson (R) and Kathleen Brown (D) kicked off the battle for California yesterday, with each claiming they could best lift the state out of its economic and psychological recession in what is being called the most significant political contest of 1994.</br></br>After the worst recession since the Great Depression and natural disasters that have shaken public faith in the once-eternal promise of the Golden State, voters will choose between the dogged and colorless Wilson and the telegenic but less experienced state treasurer, the daughter and sister of former governors.</br></br>Polls suggest the race begins as a dead heat and party leaders predict it will stay that way until November.</br></br>"This is not going to be a race where people care very much about personalities," Wilson said at a rally yesterday morning after he was nominated to a second term. "They shouldn't. They ought to be concerned about issues and about performance."</br></br>Brown, beginning a two-day trip around the state after her primary victory on Tuesday, told supporters, "What this race is going to be about is effectiveness, effectiveness in getting the job done for the people of California." She warned that the state could not afford another four years of a "Rip Van Wilson administration" that wakes up "just in time for the election."
he stock market was right on the money in predicting a quick victory in the war. The question now is whether Wall Street's confidence in the economy will prove to be equally accurate.</br></br>This year's powerful stock market rally, which took off in mid-January when the first bombs fell on Baghdad, has acquired so much internal momentum that many analysts now predict that stock prices will remain on an overall upward trajectory through the spring and into early summer.</br></br>"Without much problem, over the next two to four months, I think we can get to a level of 3200 on the Dow," said Thomas F. Carpenter, senior vice president and chief economist at ASB Capital Management Inc., Washington's largest investment management firm. That would represent a 10 percent gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, the best-known measure of the market, which closed on Friday at 2909.90.</br></br>But the market's fate in the second half of the year will depend heavily on whether the economy pulls out of its current slump in coming months and paves the way for a significant improvement in corporate profits in 1992, according to Wall Street strategists and portfolio managers. Many experts are worried that a weak banking system, revived inflation and economic downturns abroad may sap the stock market's strength.</br></br>"For me, the rest of the first half is going to be fine {for the stock market}. It's the second half that's going to be the letdown," said Joseph A. Feshbach, executive vice president and director of technical market analysis at the New York investment firm of Lehman Brothers Inc., a subsidiary of American Express Co.
New York, July 19 OF.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½After joggling around all-day, the stock market edged ahead today in the final minutes of trading.</br></br>Strength was concentrated in a few issues. The advance was not general but enough issues climbed aboard to make the gains exceed the losses.</br></br>Traders quite evidently were not climbing aboard any bandwagons going in any direction. Operations were largely confined to specific issues or areas coming under specialized influences.</br></br>Caution was dictated by three principal factors. Talks between the United Nations representatives and Communists in Korea are nearing a show-down stage. Success or failure, it was indicated, might be hanging on a secret issueï¿½ï¿½ï¿½possibly the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.</br></br>Congress is nearing the end of its long debate over price and wage controls. Price Director DiSalle warned that the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½cost-plus-guaranteed profitï¿½Û amendment adopted by the House could wreck the price control program.
NEW YORK -- Former President Ronald Reagan isn't the only brass fetching big dollars for making noise in Japan.</br></br>U.S. musical instrument stores report that any time a used Selmer Mark VI saxophone hits the shelf, it is scooped up by Japanese musicians and dealers.</br></br>"It seems to have built into a frenzy in the last couple of years," says Stanley S. Garber, a marketing agent for the U.S. distributor, Selmer Co., based in Elkhart, Ind. "It has sort of gotten out of hand."</br></br>First introduced in 1954, the Mark VI was heralded as the product of thirty years of research. Jazz musicians consider the instrument superior to others in craftsmanship and metal quality. But only about 200,000 Mark VIs were ever produced by Paris-based H. Selmer & Cie. It hasn't been made since 1973.</br></br>When new, the Mark VI sold for less than $800. No more. Prices have jumped by more than $1,000 since 1985 to between $2,500 and $2,800. Shop keepers and players blame the inflation on the Japanese. In Japan, where jazz has exploded in popularity, Mark VIs often sell for over $4,000.
Tax-deferred lump-sum pension payments, available since January to feds forced to retire because of base closings, layoffs or abolished positions, are on the way out. The perk will be eliminated for most retirees under budget plans in the works.</br></br>The House-passed budget would eliminate the benefit as of Dec. 31. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee plan would drop the benefit as of Sept. 30, 1995. Both would continue the benefit for terminally ill workers who take non-disability retirements.</br></br>For a brief period several years ago, lump-sum payments were available to almost all retirees, but they weren't a very good deal. In addition to reducing lifetime pension benefits (which are indexed to inflation), most of the lump-sum payments were subject to federal and state taxes. Even so, about 300,000 retirees took the payments - and got hit with the big tax bite - before Congress suspended them about two years ago except for the terminally ill.</br></br>Under legislation that took effect this year, more people could qualify. In addition to those with life-threatening illnesses, the benefit was extended to people who took discontinued service retirement because their jobs were abolished.</br></br>The legislation also permitted them to defer taxes on the taxable part of the lump-sum payment by rolling it over into an individual retirement account or another pension plan. That makes the payments a good deal, especially at a time when agency staffs are being reduced. But it apparently won't be around much longer.Departures
As President Bush was out in Peoria touting the virtues of foreign trade and asking for fresh authority to promote it, newly ascendant Democrats on Capitol Hill signaled just how tough it's going to be for the president to get what he wants.</br></br>In a hearing, Democrats repeated earlier warnings that they are unlikely to approve pending trade pacts with Peru, Colombia and Panama unless the administration agrees to provisions tightening labor and environmental protections in those countries. They pledged to demand similar labor rules before extending the president's authority to negotiate new trade deals.</br></br>"We have had trade policies in this administration that assume that trade is an end in itself, that market forces will work themselves out, that there isn't really an active role for government," said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), who chairs a House subcommittee on trade. "We've had a tremendous loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs."</br></br>The new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.), presided over a wide-ranging discussion that touched on how to prevent companies from shifting production to exploitative factories in poor countries, how to confront China over allegedly unfair trade practices and how to help Americans who lose jobs.</br></br>The hearing took place as President Bush visited the Illinois headquarters of Caterpillar, the construction-equipment giant and a highly successful exporter. There, the president asked Congress to extend his so-called trade promotion authority -- his legal right to negotiate trade pacts that he can submit to lawmakers for a simple up-or-down vote. It expires at the end of June, and without it, trade deals stand little chance of getting through Congress as individual legislators pick them apart to protect jobs in their districts.
Financial regulators yesterday rejected calls for more direct oversight of hedge funds and said that the current system for preventing market collapse and widespread investor losses is "working well" in their first policy statement on the issue in eight years.</br></br>Hedge funds are loosely regulated pools of private investment designed for wealthy individuals and institutions. Nearly 9,000 of the rapidly growing funds control more than $1 trillion in assets. On a given day, the funds may account for a third of the trading volume in major U.S. stock exchanges, according to industry estimates.</br></br>The funds' outsized returns are drawing interest from pension funds and less-well-heeled investors -- and concern from investor advocates and analysts who fear that excessive borrowing and risky trading bets by the funds could induce instability in the market.</br></br>The unanimous policy directive by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets comes weeks after pressure from allies in Europe and elsewhere to pay heightened attention to the hedge fund sector. Led by Germany, the Group of Seven nations pressed for more vigilance in policing the funds earlier this month. On Tuesday, Canadian authorities proposed forcing hedge fund managers in that country to register with regulators.</br></br>The approach in the United States has been far less direct. The Securities and Exchange Commission tried to impose a similar registration requirement in 2004, only to see it struck down by a federal appeals court as overreaching. The SEC is considering a separate proposal to raise the minimum net worth that would allow an individual to invest in a hedge fund to $2.5 million from $1 million.
Nicholas Schorsch, a prolific deal maker in commercial real estate, announced a pair of multibillion-dollar transactions Monday, expanding his hotel empire and selling a large company that specializes in health-care properties.</br></br>Mr. Schorsch said he would sell his American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust Inc. to Ventas Inc., a giant health-care real-estate investment trust, in a $2.6 billion cash-and-stock deal.</br></br>Also Monday, Mr. Schorsch's American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust said it would acquire the Equity Inns, which owns 126 hotels in 35 U.S. states, from a real-estate fund sponsored by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., for $1.92 billion.</br></br>Separately, Mr. Schorsch's flagship company, the publicly traded REIT American Realty Capital Propeties Inc. disclosed Monday in a securities filing that shareholders had voted against the company's executive-compensation plan. The vote against the plan was nonbinding. The plan would make Mr. Schorsch one of the most highly paid REIT executives, if the company hits certain performance objectives.</br></br>Under the terms of the health-care deal, shareholders of New York-based ARC Healthcare will have the option to receive 0.1688 Ventas shares for each of their shares in ARC. The deal values the ARC shares at $11.33 each, a 14% premium to their $9.95 close on Friday.
Riding a bumpy road to nowhere, stock prices yesterday ended little changed after a busy session of profit-taking.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.14 to a record 2237.63, one day after registering an unprecedented 54.14-point advance. The broader market indexes were mixed yesterday.</br></br>A flurry of foreign buying pushed up the industrial average more than 17 points in the first half hour of trading yesterday. But most of the gains quickly evaporated as investors took profits in many of Tuesday's winners.</br></br>"It's normal to run into a big bout of profit-taking" after a surge in prices, a New York-based stock trader said. Sell programs tied to stock-index futures knocked out the rest of the early gains, as well as a lot more, from the market. At noon EST the industrial average was up 8.44, but just a half hour later it was down 17.15 -- a swing of more than 25 points. Stocks slowly recovered most of their losses throughout the afternoon.</br></br>It's a "victory for the bulls" that the market could absorb all the profit-taking, said Philip Erlanger, technical analyst at Advest, Hartford, Conn.
NEW YORK -- MasterCard Inc.'s second-quarter profit jumped 31%, beating analysts' expectations, as higher consumer spending in Latin America, Europe and Asia boosted the top line.</br></br>Though sales of discretionary items in the U.S. have slumped in recent months, the company said spending in Europe hasn't been hurt by macroeconomic uncertainty, and its Asian-Pacific and Latin America businesses continue to expand by double digits on a percentage basis.</br></br>Still, President and Chief Executive Ajay Banga said during a conference call on Tuesday that there could be "some tempering" in top-line growth in the second half of the year compared with the 9.7% revenue increase the company posted for the six months through June, citing an uneven pace of economic recovery, especially in the U.S., as well as tough comparisons to strong year-ago figures.</br></br>Roll-offs of some debit-card portfolios will continue to damp processed-transaction results as well, though MasterCard expects the effects of those terminated contracts to wane after the third quarter.</br></br>Shares of MasterCard fell $1.61, or 0.8%, to $200.91, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
NEW YORK -- The dollar shot higher after Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger said that long-term interest rates in Germany could drop more than a percentage point from current levels.</br></br>The U.S. currency also was aided by exceptionally thin market conditions, which provided little resistance to the dollar's rise. And, as the dollar broke above key levels on the technical charts, additional buying kicked in, observers said.</br></br>The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, continued to strengthen, despite a further slip in the country's interest rates. Although the currency's long-term fundamental outlook remains questionable, most traders and analysts said the currency's mainstay is strong year-end demand for Canadian fixed-income instruments.</br></br>Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.5895 marks, up from 1.5690 marks late Monday and at 123.75 yen, up from 123.10 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.5370, well below $1.5580 Monday.</br></br>"Schlesinger really set the tone" for the dollar's rally, said Michael Wissell, director for corporate foreign exchange at Toronto Dominion Bank. "And we really haven't looked back," he added.
The National Association of Securities Dealers will announce today that it has hired Mary Schapiro, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as its new chief regulator.</br></br>Schapiro, 40, said yesterday she will leave her post in January to become the first president of NASD Regulation Inc., which will oversee the Nasdaq Stock Market and register and regulate all stock brokers and other market professionals. The post is considered crucial in the NASD's effort to restore the damage done to its reputation by two ongoing federal investigations.</br></br>The NASD is transferring its regulatory responsibilities to an independent subsidiary in response to criticism that it has been so busy running the Nasdaq market that it has neglected the oversight duties it was given by Congress.</br></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission has served notice that it is preparing disciplinary charges against the NASD based on allegations that Nasdaq traders take advantage of small investors. And the Justice Department has sued the NASD to get records of trading that government lawyers contend is rigged against customers.</br></br>In an interview, Schapiro said she has yet to dig into the specific problems confronting the NASD. "I won't know what needs to be fixed until I get there and have some realistic assessment of the organization," she said. "I really believe that NASD has an important role to play and that I can help it do that more effectively."
General Motors, whose $19.3 billion pension deficit was the biggest in the United States last year, may eliminate the shortfall by the end of the year because of rising stock markets, higher contributions and an asset sale, a company spokeswoman said. The Detroit-based carmaker contributed $14.4 billion to its pension funds in 2003 and will add $4 billion more if the sale of its stake in Hughes Electronics to News Corp. is completed this year, the spokeswoman said.</br></br>Scott H. Miller, the former senior vice president of finance at Las Vegas software firm PurchasePro, was sentenced in federal court in Alexandria to 10 days in prison, three years of probation and 150 hours of community service. Miller, who pleaded guilty in September to impeding a federal criminal probe into deals involving PurchasePro and America Online, is cooperating with the ongoing investigation of AOL.</br></br>The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, representing 36,000 engineers at Union Pacific and other North American railroads, approved a merger with the Teamsters. The engineers join a 1.4 million-member, Washington-based union that also includes truck drivers, dockworkers and airline employees.</br></br>U.S. consumer debt increased in October at its slowest pace in four months, restrained by a decline in borrowing for vehicle purchases, Federal Reserve statistics showed. Borrowing through credit cards, auto loans and other non-mortgage personal debt increased $941 million, or 0.6 percent, to $1.977 trillion, the Fed said. In September, consumer credit rose a revised $17 billion, the largest increase since January.</br></br>Smithfield Foods, the nation's largest hog producer and pork processor, is being sued for fraud and breach of contract by a company it took over earlier this year. Pennexx Foods is seeking $226 million in compensatory damages and other unspecified punitive damages for Virginia-based Smithfield's actions leading up to the June takeover. Smithfield, which previously owned 41 percent of Pennexx, seized Pennexx's assets after it could not pay back $11.9 million in loans.
NEW YORK, March 2 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market overcame a tendency toward further profit taking and returned to the winning column today after a one-day lapse. Trading was active.</br></br>The rise came following yesterdayï¿½Ûªs interruption of a series of seven straight daily advances which took the Dow Jones industrial average once more above the 900 level.</br></br>Todayï¿½Ûªs gain recovered a good portion of yesterdayï¿½Ûªs decline. The Dow industrials rose 2.15 to 901.91. On average, the movements both days were small.</br></br>Exceptional strength developed in some of the airlines, some rails, electrical equipments and rubbers. The advance was irregular, with not much of a plurality of gainers over losers in the stock list. The rise was accomplished despite weakness in du Pont, off 2Vz, Eastman Kodak, off 1, American Telephone, off % and Sears, Roebuck, off %.</br></br>Gold minning stocks again made gains, spurred by reports of a shrinkage in U.S. gold holdings and further concern about the Nationï¿½Ûªs balance of payments in foreign exchange. Other nonferrous metals moved ahead moderately. The three top steelmakers, however, lost fractions.
TORONTO -- Stelco Inc. said it will slash its quarterly dividend in half, cut salaries and reduce spending on capital projects as a result of the recession in its steel markets and the effects of a seven-week strike by the United Steelworkers of America.</br></br>The Toronto steel manufacturer said it will cut its regular quarterly dividend payment to 12.5 Canadian cents (U.S. 10.8 cents) a share from 25 Canadian cents a share, the first such cut in nine years. The last time it cut its dividend, Stelco was also in the midst of a lengthy steelworkers' strike.</br></br>Company officials said that the decision to cut the dividend, payable Nov. 1, could save Stelco about C$4.4 million (US$3.8 million). They declined to estimate savings from cutting salaries and capital spending.</br></br>The company had planned to spend C$185 million on capital projects during 1990, a significant portion of which was accounted for by a project to reline one of its blast furnaces. That reline, begun July 1, has been halted by the strike, Stelco said.</br></br>A spokesman for Stelco said salaries will be cut "progressively" as long as the strike continues. He declined to identify the size of the initial reductions.
NEW YORK, May 13ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market backed away from a major technical test this week, but Wall Street analysts said they saw no need for any concern.</br></br>| After a continuation of its ; rally on Monday ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ which ipushed into the 910-930 area, the Dow Jones industrial average turned down in three of the next four sessions and finished the week off 15.93 points at 890.03.</br></br>Technicians consider the 910-930 area a formidable barrier, since in the past two years it has temporarily turned back both the rally of 1965 and the selloff of 1966.</br></br>The correction hit b 1 u e chips stocks harder than most other issues. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock composite was down 0.96 point to 93.48. According to Wall Streetï¿½Ûªs rule of thumb, the Dow should move In a 10-to-1 ratio with the S&P.</br></br>Analysts said the downturn so far showed no signs of being anything but normal profit-taking as the market prepared to test the resistance area. Business news was mixed during the week but brokers saw little to cause any sharp move in either direction.
The South African rand was the top decliner among emerging-market currencies Wednesday, hit by concerns about the government's budget forecasts and broader worries about political uncertainty in Italy and the U.S.</br></br>On Wednesday, South Africa's government released budget figures that reaffirmed some of the biggest problems plaguing Africa's biggest economy, especially its budget deficit. The finance ministry revised its forecast for the budget deficit for fiscal year 2012-2013 to 5.2% of gross domestic product from 4.8%, but some analysts said the deficit could surprise and come in even worse than that.</br></br>There was also an upward revision in expected government revenues for this fiscal year, which might be too optimistic, analysts said.</br></br>"The fact is that the economy is running below potential. It's not a rosy background," said Guillaume Tresca, emerging market currency strategist at Credit Agricole.</br></br>The rand slid 0.3% against the dollar, which traded at ZAR8.8472 Wednesday, according to CQG.
The Japanese yen registered sharp gains Friday during a session in which activity in the dollar and many other currencies featured narrow ranges and little departure from the previous day's levels.</br></br>The catalyst for the yen's surge was comments from Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii, who said in a Thursday evening meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that he opposed intentionally devaluing the yen or any other currency. Japan's currency cracked the psychologically important 90 yen barrier against the dollar, hitting to its highest intraday levels in more than seven months on the greenback.</br></br>The new Japanese finance minister's reluctance to control currency levels was taken as a strong suggestion that Tokyo wouldn't intervene even if the dollar sustains its fall below the 90 yen level, said Eisuke Sakakibara, a former top official at Japan's Finance Ministry.</br></br>Before recovering modestly, the dollar fell as far as 89.51 yen, its lowest level since early February. The yen also chalked up solid gains against other currencies, including the euro.</br></br>Late Friday in New York, the yen was trading at 89.85 yen from 91.22 yen a day earlier, while the euro fell to 131.81 yen from 133.69 yen. The euro against the dollar was at $1.4670 from $1.4656 late Thursday, and the U.K. pound was at $1.5930 from $1.6064. The dollar was at 1.0293 Swiss francs from 1.0300 francs.
Outgoing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will provide testimony after he leaves office in a lawsuit filed against the federal government over the 2008 bailout of American International Group Inc., according to a person involved in the case.</br></br>The lawsuit was filed in 2011 by Starr International Co., run by former longtime AIG Chief Executive Maurice "Hank" Greenberg. Starr, an investment and charitable firm, was AIG's largest shareholder at the time of the government rescue.</br></br>Filed in Federal Claims Court in Washington, D.C., the lawsuit alleges that the government takeover of AIG had elements that were unconstitutional, including that the government took valuable property from Starr and other AIG shareholders without just compensation. Starr is seeking billions in damages.</br></br>Mr. Greenberg's legal team has sought the deposition for months. In October 2013, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Mr. Bernanke didn't have to provide testimony in the lawsuit, at least until his term expires on Jan. 31, 2014. The Federal Circuit ruling overturned a decision made by the lower claims court that Mr. Bernanke should be required to give testimony to attorneys representing Starr International.</br></br>With Mr. Bernanke's departure from the Fed at the end of this month, the team persisted in seeking it.
FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West Germany's central bank isn't expected to reduce its discount rate when its policy-setting panel meets tomorrow, despite pressure to follow recent cuts by the U.S. and Japan.</br></br>West German banking analysts said they expect the Bundesbank to leave the discount rate unchanged at 3.5% because of concern over money-supply growth and the German mark's weakness in the European Monetary System, a joint float of eight continental European currencies. The analysts said that if the central bank takes any action, it is likely to lower the Lombard rate, which currently is 5.5%.</br></br>The Lombard rate, a short-term fee under which banks borrow funds from the central bank using securities as collateral, has served as an upper marker for West German money-market rates. The discount rate, a longer-term rate under which banks can borrow using bills -- primarily government and commercial paper -- as collateral, serves as the central bank's key tool for steering market interest rates.</br></br>In Washington, the Treasury declined to comment on the possibility that the West German central bank might reduce its Lombard rate. But in general, U.S. reaction was muted.</br></br>The Reagan administration would prefer to see the Bundesbank cut its discount rate rather than the Lombard rate, which is narrower in scope. However, any cut in the Lombard rate still would be seen as a welcome gesture of West German support for the latest round of interest rate cuts and would be within the range the U.S. wants.
The U.S. Treasury said yesterday that its mortgage-assistance initiative helped 45,000 distressed subprime homeowners get new loans in its first month, but a veteran mortgage banker who helps run the program said many of them may not receive long-term relief and could ultimately face higher total costs.</br></br>While some borrowers stand to benefit from a temporary reduction in their interest rates, others may not, instead being given loans that just allow them more time to repay their debt, said Bill Longbrake, a senior policy adviser for the Financial Services Roundtable lobbying group and vice chairman of Washington Mutual. The latter group of delinquent homeowners could face additional charges and late fees for missing payments. Only a very small group of borrowers could get their mortgage principal reduced outright, he said.</br></br>When the Bush administration announced the effort last year, officials said they were offering a long-term solution to a growing foreclosure crisis. The program, which is being run by a Treasury-brokered alliance of lenders and nonprofit groups that calls itself Hope Now, offers loan modifications to subprime mortgage holders whose interest rates have jumped in the past year, granting them a five-year rate freeze so they can work out new terms with their lenders.</br></br>But financial firms have been reluctant to offer generous loan modifications because they have to consider the returns of the investors who buy mortgages and provide the crucial financial backing for the loans, Longbrake said.</br></br>"A mortgage servicer's obligation is to get the maximum value to the investor over the life of the loan," he said. "If you are going to modify the loan and keep the borrower in the house, the bias is to do that for a shorter rather than longer period of time. . . . There's a reluctance to do long-term modifications."
An extremely grim world economic situation has emerged in the past year because of high inflation on a global scale, a marked slowdown in growth and volatile trading relationships, according to the annual report of the International Monetary Fund.</br></br>The IMF also warned that the impact of soaring trade deficits in developing countries that do not produce oil is threatening the ability of these nations to find financial support for continued trading and economic expansion.</br></br>A slowdown in industrial nations could lead to a halt in the expansion of world trade and create another international recession, the Washington-based organization said in a report scheduled for publication next weekend.</br></br>Privately, officials of the IMF have said they expect that a major theme of debates at the world bodyï¿½Ûªs annual meetings starting here later this month will he urgent appeals by developing nations for more extensive help from the richer countries.</br></br>At the same time, an IMF official forecast that the predicted debates are not expected to result in substantive policy changes or initiatives from the rich countries. Nor is any softening expected in implementation of .IMF lending guidelines, although some international lending executives anticipate a move to permit longer periods for loan repayments by countries that are strapped for funds.
NEW YORK, Oct. 27ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Takeover news and speculation provided most of the excitement as the stock market chalked up some spotty gains today.</br></br>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange came to 133.24 million shares, down from 137.48 million Friday.</br></br>Later this week, the Treasury is due to announce its quarterly financing plans. Analysts said traders were wary about interest-rate prospects, pending word on the size of the refunding and signs of how it might be received.</br></br>Though stock prices have managed to post some gains in recent weeks, the rally has been met with considerable skepticism on Wall Street.</br></br>Brokers say investors' confidence apparently has yet to recover fully from the selloff that hit the market early last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average reached a new high for the year following a generally upbeat assessment from the Federal Reserve, which left interest rates unchanged.</br></br>The Fed signaled that the prospects for the economy are improving, helping to keep stocks up across the board even though the rate decision was anticipated. Many investors said they were relieved the Fed didn't signal excessive nervousness about inflation, though it did give one of its first indications that it might raise interest rates later this year if the economic turnaround continues.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 0.54%, or 57.50 points, at 10635.25. That's just above the previous high for the year, hit a week ago, of 10632.35. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 0.41%, or 4.74 points to 1170.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.20%, or 3.81 points, to 1880.87.</br></br>Bond prices edged higher and the dollar was up.</br></br>Stocks dropped slightly after the Fed's announcement at 2:20 p.m. EST but managed to fend off afternoon selling pressure and close in positive territory.

Disappointing retail sales figures and an unexpected jump in unemployment claims prompted investors to take profits Thursday, leaving stocks mixed despite another big drop in oil prices.</br></br>One day after crude oil futures posted their biggest decline since September 2001, oil prices again fell sharply.</br></br>However, stock investors were disappointed with November sales reports from the nation's retailers. A number of top retailers issued lower-than-expected sales reports as the holiday shopping season got underway. With two-thirds of the U.S. economy powered by consumer spending, many investors hoped strong holiday spending would boost the economy through the end of the year.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.10, or 0.05 percent, to 10,585.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.04, or 0.1 percent, to 1190.33, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 5.34, or 0.3 percent, to 2143.57.</br></br>Investors also were nervous after the Labor Department reported a sharp rise in first-time unemployment claims, which climbed 25,000 last week, to 349,000.
Although the reasons behind Thursday's surge were a bit of a mystery, there were plenty of reasons for stocks to retreat yesterday -- reports of rising unemployment, more profit warnings and the bankruptcy filing of California's biggest utility.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 126.96 points to close at 9791.09, after soaring the previous day to its second-largest daily point gain. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 64.64, to 1720.36. The stock market's broadest measure, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, fell 23.01, to 1128.43.</br></br>For the week, the Nasdaq dropped 6.6 percent, the S&P 500 declined 2.9 percent and the Dow fell 1.1 percent, despite the frenzied buying on Thursday.</br></br>Thursday's "rally was severe," said Michael W. Clark, head of equity trading for Credit Suisse First Boston, who said the sell-off yesterday was a logical reaction to that. "The bottom line," he said, "is that the underlying trend hasn't changed."</br></br>Yesterday morning, the Labor Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent in March, the highest it has been in 20 months. Worse, businesses cut 86,000 jobs, the biggest one- month reduction in payrolls since 1991.
Want a free trip to Paris?</br></br>Just sign up.</br></br>Hard-core collectors of frequent-flier miles are turning credit card sign-up bonus offers into vast stashes of miles, points and expensive trips by opening new card accounts by the dozen. Some practitioners call it travel hacking, and at a time when travelers are frustrated by declining service and growing airline fees and fares, it represents a rare travel bonanza.</br></br>Card sign-up bonuses rocketed onto the free-perk scene a couple of years ago, then waned. Now they've come back strong, with some companies advertising bonuses of up to 50,000 miles for people with good credit. Others are offering even more miles directly to high spenders in unadvertised deals.</br></br>In March, Capital One Financial Corp. gave away one billion miles by offering bonuses matching customers' airline frequent-flier account balances of up to 100,000 miles.
Simon Kuznets, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, is best known for his work on the national income accounts. How big is the American economy? How fast does it grow? How do we measure recessions and expansions? Answers to such questions have become possible only in the past four or five decades largely through the work of Kuznets and other dedicated professionals at the National Bureau of Economic Research.</br></br>In a new National Bureau study, "Some Notes on the Scientific Methods of Simon Kuznets" (Working Paper No. 2461), Robert Fogel of the University of Chicago makes it clear that Kuznets, who died in 1985 at the age of 84, was a man with a mission that never could be completed.</br></br>Mr. Fogel recalls that Kuznets once remarked, "Anyone can start a row in economics; it is much harder to find out what is really happening to the economy." Where the economy has been and where it is now -- those were the matters that concerned Kuznets. Economic forecasts may get more headlines, but the forecasts will never be very good until we get a better grip on our present and past.</br></br>Last week provided an example of the uproar that bad statistics can cause. In the first half of the 1980s the strong dollar made imports cheap and exports expensive, so the nation ran big trade deficits. Finally, the Reagan administration decided to let the dollar sink. Of course, it didn't want the dollar to go into a "free fall" -- it would stop the fall at the "right" place, when the dollar had reached its "proper" level. And what was that level? When exports began a sustainable rise and imports a sustainable fall.</br></br>How would we know? We would watch the Commerce Department reports on the merchandise trade deficit. Last week the department announced that the November trade deficit was $13.2 billion, a sharp drop from the record $17.6 billion of the month before. The stock and bond markets threw a party to celebrate.
Various church groups have issued Labor Day proclamations and announced their support of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½full employment weekï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª beginning Sept. 4 in an attempt to urge government action that would result in a near-zero unemployment rale.</br></br>President William P. Thompson and General Secretary Claire Randall of (he National Council of Churches warned in a proclamation that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a failure on the part of church people and policymakers to move on a full employment policy will result in the eventual deterioration of the will and purpose of the nation.ï¿½Û</br></br>In their statement, the NCC officials said President Carter should develop a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½full employment and national purposes budget" to create private and public sector jobs in energy, mass transportation, housing, education and other fields.</br></br>Urging that a specific effort should be made in the private employment sector, the NCC officials said the federal government should become ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the employer of last resort" for those who canï¿½Ûªt find private jobs.</br></br>The two church leaders also suggested the coordination of the policies of the Federal Reserve Board, such as setting of interest rcates, with a government program for full employment and the establishment of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½an adminis-(rativc appeals procedureï¿½Û for the unemployed.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices rose sharply yesterday after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker expressed concern about sluggishness in the economy's manufacturing sectors.</br></br>Traders interpreted Mr. Volcker's remarks as an indication that the Fed won't tighten its credit policy. Some analysts say the Fed may even loosen its credit grip and push down interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy.</br></br>Prices of some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds surged more than a point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities. Most short-term interest rates fell.</br></br>The rally erased the sharp declines in bond prices registered Monday when the markets were jolted by the collapse of a small securities firm. The company, Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Asset Management Corp. in Livingston, N.J., was placed under bankruptcy-law protection. That aroused worry among some dealers that foreign investors, concerned about the U.S. financial system, might shy away from purchasing additional U.S. securities.</br></br>Mr. Volcker, speaking at a conference sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of the U.S., said he was concerned about "imbalances" in the U.S. economy. He pointed to the lackluster performance of several sectors, notably mining, manufacturing and agriculture.
A former corporate client of Credit Suisse First Boston opened a new legal front in the attack on how Wall Street allocates initial public offerings of stock.</br></br>Creditors of the company formerly known as Mortgage.com Inc., which was taken public during the IPO boom, accused the Wall Street firm, a unit of Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group, of breaching its underwriting contract by "obtaining kickbacks" in the form of unusually large trading commissions from investors seeking IPO allocations.</br></br>The suit by MDCM Holdings Inc. -- the entity that survived after Mortgage.com sold its name and Web site address last year for $1.8 million to a U.S. unit of ABN Amro Holding NV -- is a rare effort by a company claiming it was shortchanged in the IPO allocation process, securities lawyers say. Before ceasing operations, the suit says, MDCM was a provider of online-mortgage services.</br></br>The case marks a twist in the current controversy surrounding the way Wall Street allocates IPO shares. Since December, individuals have filed more than 125 suits against major securities firms, alleging that they violated federal securities laws by seeking, among other things, oversized commission payments from investors who received IPOs, according to lawyers tracking the suits.</br></br>But the MDCM suit stands out because it represents a corporate client of a Wall Street firm alleging IPO impropriety. Legal actions by corporate clients potentially are more problematic for Wall Street firms because such companies could possess more detailed data about who received their IPO shares.
No matter how much Congress and President Clinton can agree to trim the federal budget deficit, as long as there is a deficit of any size, the national debt will continue to mount. With the administration projecting that the budget deficit will fall little between now and 2000, the resulting steady rise in the debt means that interest payments will continue to climb and pass the $300 billion mark at the end of the decade.</br></br>Interest on the debt is becoming increasingly costly. Last year's federal budget deficit would have been a scant $200 million were it not for the $203 billion the government had to pay the public in interest.</br></br>By 1997, the interest payments -- which are partially offset by interest received from the public and by interest received by government trust funds, such as those for Social Security and civil service retirees -- will be greater than defense spending. At that point, only Social Security payments will claim a greater chunk of the budget than net interest payments.</br></br>The chart at the right shows the strong link between the cost of financing the debt accumulated from past deficits and the annual amount of red ink in succeeding years.</br></br>Obviously, many other factors have been at work, with the deficit exceeding net interest payments in all but two of the fiscal years from 1975 to 1994. However, the message of the chart is clear: The budget gap the new congressional Republican majority has vowed to close is perhaps not so much a matter of overspending today as of the decisions of past Congresses and presidents, both Republicans and Democrats, to borrow rather than balance budgets.
A fire at an oil and gas well in Mexico could burn for weeks, said state oil monopoly Pemex.</br></br>Sony's turnaround strategy was thrown into doubt after the electronics maker reported weak quarterly results and cut its profit forecast for the year by 40%.</br></br>AstraZeneca appointed a new CFO and disclosed two U.S. Justice Department investigations into its drugs as it said net profit fell 18% in the third quarter.</br></br>Exxon posted an 18% fall in third-quarter earnings on its refining business, while Shell posted a 31% slide in quarterly profit on weak refining margins and a rise in exploration-and-production expenses.</br></br>The world's largest commodities traders are bolstering their presence in the growing spot market for liquefied natural gas.
WASHINGTON--Prices of imported goods posted their biggest drop in nearly 21ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½2 years in November, more evidence that falling oil prices, slow growth abroad and a strong dollar are holding down inflation in the U.S.</br></br>Import prices fell 1.5% from October, the said Thursday. Compared to one year earlier, prices were down 2.3%, the biggest year-over year drop since the spring of 2013.</br></br>The cost of overseas goods has been falling since July alongside a steady decline in oil prices. . Prices are down more than 40% since June.</br></br>But the price of other goods also is falling, potentially pushing key inflation gauges lower and complicating the Federal Reserve's plans to raise interest rates as the labor market improves and the overall economy shows signs of steadier growth.</br></br>Thursday's report said petroleum import prices fell 6.9% in November from the previous month and were down 12.3% on the year. Excluding petroleum, import prices declined 0.3% from the previous month and are up only 0.1% from a year earlier.
The Federal Reserve, delivering the lowest short-term rates since John F. Kennedy was president, is pursuing its most aggressive campaign in recent history to stimulate the economy. But it's a campaign whose goal seems more elusive with each passing day.</br></br>Yesterday, the Fed cut the target for its benchmark federal-funds interest rate to 2.5% from 3%, and left the door open to further rate cuts. "The terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy that was already weak," the Fed said in a statement explaining its action.</br></br>Though the Fed's move was widely anticipated, investors reacted positively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 113.76 points, 1.29%, to 8950.59.</br></br>Including its emergency rate cut just before the nation's stock markets reopened on Sept. 17, the Fed has chopped U.S. rates a full percentage point since Sept. 11, and by a whopping four percentage points since the start of the year.</br></br>But lower interest rates work only if they induce consumers and businesses to borrow -- and then spend -- more. And since the Fed began cutting rates, the growth in business borrowing has ground to a halt, and consumer-credit growth has slowed sharply. Only home mortgage lending is still growing at a healthy pace, and even that has taken a hit in the wake of the terrorist attack.
Julie Barth's prayers were answered when a doctor in Crystal Lake, Ill., told her in vitro fertilization might get her pregnant.</br></br>But he didn't stop there, referring her to a "fertility finance" company that lent her $5,000 at an interest rate of 7.99% to help cover the $24,000 procedure. Her daughter, Olivia, was born about a year later.</br></br>"You can't put a price on a smile like that," says Ms. Barth, 32 years old. She hopes to pay off her loan from Springstone Financial LLC, based in Southborough, Mass., by her daughter's third birthday in 2014.</br></br>At a time when many traditional lenders are struggling, companies that join forces with doctors to make loans for in vitro fertilization, egg harvesting and other fertility treatments say their business is thriving.</br></br>One reason: Fertility-finance companies are getting a boost from the banking industry's retrenchment. For example, credit has become tight for home-equity loans and credit cards, two ways couples often have paid for fertility treatments that often top $20,000. Mike Gilroy, Springstone's president, says business is robust because "if the time is right" to have a baby, "people want loans even in a sluggish economy."
Author: Neil Shah</br></br>NEW YORK--The euro drifted higher against the dollar after sliding sharply in European trading, as the currency surmounted worries about the European Central Bank's inflation-fighting acumen and the region's debt woes.</br></br>German central bank chief Axel Weber's decision to no longer seek the presidency of the European Central Bank sparked fears that the ECB's next leader may lack a strong stance against rising price pressures. Central banks raise key interest rates to cool off inflation, and higher rates can push a currency's value higher.</br></br>But traders shrugged off their fears, along with comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke acknowledging the U.S. central bank might end its $600 billion bond-buying program before its expected end in June. Mr. Bernanke's comments briefly boosted the dollar against the euro.</br></br>After dipping to $1.3610, the euro climbed to a high of $1.3745 before easing off. Interest rates on U.S. Treasury bonds dipped after a strong sale of U.S. government debt, pushing the euro higher against the dollar. Investors, meanwhile, are still hoping that European leaders will map out a strategy for financing struggling euro-zone nations.
MANCHESTER, Vt. -- Months after her school fund-raising campaign ended, Jenny Davis still sees only two kinds of people when she drives around town: those who donated and those who didn't ante up a dime.</br></br>She knows who's who because the campaign maintains a file on every property owner in town. "There are people who are just freeloaders," says the 38-year-old mother of two. "It's hard to look at those people in the same way."</br></br>School fund-raising in this mountain resort town of 3,600 is anything but a friendly drive for new band uniforms. For parents such as Ms. Davis, it is a crusade to protect the town's children and keep local tax dollars out of the hands of state bureaucrats.</br></br>Manchester's no-holds-barred campaign for private donations to the public schools is making it an unusual battleground in one of America's great debates: what to do about unequal school funding. Property taxes, the main revenue source for local governments, have traditionally provided the primary funding for schools. But since the early 1970s, lawsuits in 45 states have argued that districts where property is expensive end up with the best-funded schools, creating illegal inequality.</br></br>In 20 states where judges have agreed -- and in a handful of others -- legislators have tried to share the wealth. Some states now use statewide property or sales taxes to pay for a greater proportion of their school costs. Others, facing the added pressure of antitax initiatives, cap the amount of local property taxes that a district can raise.

NEW YORK, June 17 UP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market today carved out its fourth straight new 1958 high in active trading.</br></br>Leading stocks rose from fractions to about a point. A few of the more expensive blue chips ran up several points.</br></br>Although it was a clean-cut advance for the, more actively-traded stocks the list as a whole was irregular-. Late profit taking blunted the edge of what seemed a fairly sharp advance. *</br></br>The advance centered on the industrials. Rails and utilities were mixed. Even in the industrials the rise was selective. Chosen stocks among the chemicals, nonferrous ï¿½Û¢metal, motors and steels made the best showing . A generally irregular pattern was shown by oils, aircrafts, rubbers and motion pictures.</br></br>The general economic background remained cheery. It included a cutback in .iobless benefits by some big firms, the latest boost in steel production and the fresh rise in copper prices.
NEW YORK, April 19ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market managed to squeeze through to its fifth straight advance today, but without the fireworks of the four rallies.</br></br>Autos were in tne vanguard early in the day, but some of them fell back later. Glamor stocks, for the most part, were lower.</br></br>The Dow .Tones industrial average, ahead just over two points at its best reading, hung on the close at 873.94, up 0.94 point. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock composite was ahead 0.08 point to 91.94 and</br></br>By the broadest measure, the market was practically a standoff, with (136 stocks up and 612 down, compared with 812 winners and 420 losers on Tuesday.</br></br>Volume Increases Volume ran well ahead of Tuesdayï¿½Ûªs pace early in the sessionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Exchangeï¿½Ûªs tape was two minutes late in the morningï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but the ardor cooled later on and, at the finish, 10.87 million shares had cross the tape, up from 10.5 million the day before.
Signs of sluggish growth at some top companies, hints of a flagging consumer, fresh fears of oil-price damage to the global economy -- all these are contributing to a retreat from risk in financial markets.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average last week recorded its steepest declines since 2003. It dropped 3.6% for the week to close Friday at 10087.51, 7.8% below its 3 1/2-year high reached on March 4. The Nasdaq is off 11% from a peak hit in December. And Treasury bonds, despite inflation worries, have rallied as nervous investors seek out safety from tumbling stocks.</br></br>In recent months, investors had grown surprisingly complacent about taking on risk, and indicators reflected a remarkable calm concerning potential market mayhem. But that has changed.</br></br>High oil prices, a widening U.S. trade deficit and the Federal Reserve's new concern over inflation have all chipped away at the calm mood in the financial markets. Over the weekend, finance ministers of the Group of Seven major industrial economies, meeting in Washington, expressed concern about oil prices and noted that the global economy's "expansion is less balanced than before." They also warned of the "potential for a sharper-than-expected rise in long-term interest rates" and currency volatility.</br></br>Cracks in the bull market and in investor complacency first appeared in mid-March when General Motors Corp. issued a stark earnings warning. Its shares plunged and its huge debt traded sharply lower. Ford Motor Co. earlier this month joined GM in expressing doubts about future performance. At the same time, corporate turmoil, such as the investigations into insurance giant American International Group, has resuscitated concerns about corporate behavior. Then on Thursday night International Business Machines Corp. reported its first-quarter numbers early. And they were far worse than anticipated.
A surging dollar propelled bond prices sharply higher yesterday.</br></br>In New York, U.S. Treasury bond prices fell slightly early in the day but then surged as the dollar advanced. Actively traded Treasury issues wound up with gains of more than one point, or over $10 for each $1,000 face amount.</br></br>Helping to fuel the rally was an unexpected drop in agricultural commodity prices, which traders said helped ease inflation fears. The Commodity Research Bureau's futures price index, which soared in recent weeks because of the Midwest drought, sank 3.32 points yesterday to 267.20.</br></br>The dollar's strength was especially impressive because it came despite intervention by several central banks. Traders say a stronger dollar helps lift bond prices because it reduces inflation fears and also attracts more foreign investors.</br></br>Foreign investors appear to be much more enthusiastic about American bonds lately than Americans are, several analysts agreed. "The leadership in the market has come from foreigners -- European and Japanese investors -- who believe the dollar has bottomed," said James R. Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc. He added that many U.S. investment managers remain skeptical about bonds because of fears that the economy's strength will lead to higher inflation.
California, the first state to pull the plug on electricity deregulation, may now be the first to hop back on the deregulation bandwagon under new Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.</br></br>Aides to Mr. Schwarzenegger and the governor-elect's own position papers say the new Republican administration will take California back in the direction of open electricity markets, most notably by giving big energy consumers the right to choose among suppliers. Big users were stripped of thatright after Gov. Gray Davis signed $43 billion of long-term energy supply contracts in 2001.</br></br>Those contracts were aimed at stabilizing a market that had been thrown into chaos by a combination of the poorly designed deregulation policies of former Gov. Pete Wilson's administration and aggressive moves by big energy traders like Enron Corp.</br></br>Mr. Davis "let a problem become a crisis," Mr. Wilson, now a top adviser to Mr. Schwarzenegger, said yesterday. The new governor "wants to move to a free market in power. That's still the future for the state."</br></br>Any such move by the Schwarzenegger team will be closely watched by other states. Many states backed away from energy deregulation in the wake of California's 2000-2001 crisis, which brought blackouts and billions of dollars in added energy costs, and felt their misgivings confirmed by this summer's blackout in the Great Lakes region, Northeast and Canada. Mr. Davis's handling of the California power crisis, coupled with the state's mushrooming budget deficit, fueled the recall effort that swept him from office.
SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- At a factory here that churns out plastic parts for everything from spray cans to blasting caps, laying off just one worker can be more trouble than it's worth.</br></br>The plant, owned by Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin Corp., has become so lean over the past decade that many assembly lines run with only a handful of highly trained workers.</br></br>So while mass layoffs have driven the U.S. unemployment rate to its highest in 26 years, Parker and other companies like it are responding to the slump in more surgical ways, mainly by cutting hours and shedding temporary workers.</br></br>"Because of productivity gains, every one of my people carries more dollars in sales today," says Donald Washkewicz, Parker's chief executive. In 2000, the average Parker worker represented about $125,000 a year in sales. Today, that figure tops $200,000. "If I need to cut back, I have to cut back fewer people to achieve the same goal."</br></br>Similar trims are taking place at each of Parker's nearly 300 factories. And to varying degrees, this is happening at thousands of other large and small factories across the U.S.
NEW YORK -- The life insurance industry threatened to abandon its plan to aid those who bought Baldwin-United Corp. annuities before the company filed for bankruptcy-law reorganization last year.</br></br>The threat was contained in a statement by Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., which has led the industry effort. It surprised insurance regulators and Baldwin officials, who have been negotiating over how much Baldwin will contribute to a fund to help annuity holders.</br></br>Metropolitan's statement was interpreted by some as an effort to increase the pressure on Baldwin, regulators and others involved in the negotiations. Metropolitan, however, said it simply wanted to inform the 165,000 Baldwin annuity holders that it doesn't believe "a solution is near."</br></br>In its statement Friday, Metropolitan said it couldn't set up a plan to improve the interest rates currently paid to Baldwin annuity holders because several financial questions weren't resolved by a Dec. 1 deadline the industry had set.</br></br>A plan still could be implemented if those questions are resolved "within a short time," Metropolitan said.
NEW YORK -- A sharp decline in the dollar prompted another round of inflationary fears in the credit markets yesterday as bond prices tumbled.</br></br>"If you had to sum it up in one word, the word is currency," said William M. Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. In the Treasury bond market, "we had a sell-off on our hands" as the slump in the dollar continued.</br></br>Recent economic reports indicating a widening U.S. trade deficit "were sufficiently negative that the dollar likely will decline" further in coming weeks to the lows reached last spring, said Charles Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. "The weaker dollar and the perception that it will generate higher inflation is a problem for the bond market."</br></br>Prices of 30-year Treasury issues fell nearly 1 1/2 points, or almost $15 for each $1,000 face amount as yields on some long-term bonds approached 9%. Corporate and municipal securities also plummeted.</br></br>The dollar's slide also triggered a sell-off in the stock market where the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined nearly 46 points. Despite worries that a weakening dollar will exacerbate inflation pressure, "inflation likely will remain relatively subdued," said Mr. Lieberman.
Blue-chip stocks extended their winning streak to a fourth session today, buoyed by gains in banking shares and record earnings by Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's largest brokerage house.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average ended 15.94 points higher at 3444.03. It has gained more than 91 points since the rally started last Wednesday.</br></br>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 7 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 285.97 million shares, up from 259.61 million Monday.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Dow transportation average again moved into record territory, rising 11.68 points to 1660.52, a new high for the second straight day.</br></br>But the market's advance was uneven, hampered by the lack of a convincing follow-through in bond prices. The price of the Treasury's key 30-year bond rose, but intermediate notes ended slightly lower amid lackluster demand for the Treasury's newly auctioned seven-year security.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 20 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Bank of America, the nation's largest commercial bank, issued its economic forecast for 1973 Wednesday. The picture included reduced unemployment, increased inflation, and continued strong general economic growth. .</br></br>The unemployment rate, the bank 'predicted, will drop to 5.3 per cent in 1973, from 5.7 per cent ,this year. Inflation, however, will proceed at a 3.9 per cent clip next year, compared to 3.3 per cent in 1972, it said.</br></br>The gross national product, Bank of America; predicted, will grow at the cur-rent-dollar rate at 9.6. per cent in 1973 on top of a 9.7 per cent 2972 rise. But real output was expected to grow only 6.3. per cent this year and 5.1 per cent next year.</br></br>Housing starts will start falling off, the bank said,. after ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½two years of very-strong housing investmentï¿½Û which has caused ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½localized overbuilding and increased multi-family vacancy rates.ï¿½Û Anticipated r higher interest rates also will contribute to the slowdown in housing growth, according to the prediction, which says housing starts will drop 11 per cent in 1973, after rising 11.2. per cent in 1972.</br></br>Consumer spending should grow 8.3 per cent this year and 8.6 ï¿½Û¢ per cent next, while corporate profits will rise 12.1 per cent this year and 12.6 per cent next, the bank said.
As Christmas lights go up on homes around the country, you've probably noticed that the displays seem to get more elaborate every year. No longer does decorating a single evergreen in the front yard suffice. Every tree demands its own ropes of light, wrapping trunks and branches. Ubiquitous icicle lights drape even the most generic tract home in sparkling abundance. Arbiters of taste may clash over the merits of white versus colored bulbs, and energy Puritans may denounce the inessential use of electricity. But even stylistic snobs can't entirely deny the appeal of a thousand points of holiday light.</br></br>Today's displays do more than brighten the night. They tell a story of economic progress. Like the electronic gadgets aimed at gift buyers, the tiny lights outlining roof lines illustrate new sources of growth and prosperity. Aesthetic pleasure, they tell us, is an increasingly important source of economic value and hence of new jobs and business opportunities. And the same trends that boost living standards in other areas also make Christmas lights more abundant. A holiday-lighting dollar goes a lot further than it used to. Homeowners buying Christmas lights benefit from the same intense competition that has driven down prices and improved reliability in so many other industries, raising our standard of living.</br></br>When he was a teenager in the mid-'80s, David VanderMolen's job was to buy and install holiday lights for his family's Charlotte, Mich., home. Each year his parents would give him $10, enough for two 35- light strings, each 20 feet long, from Kmart. If the weather wasn't bad, a string would last three years. He eventually built up a collection of 350 light-strings, enough to make his house the most elaborately decorated in the neighborhood. Today, it would be nothing special. You can buy a 100-light string, 50 feet long, for $2.44 at Wal-Mart. Even without adjusting for inflation, that old $10 annual budget would cover more lights in a year than one could accumulate over seven years in the '80s. Today's cheaper lights, mostly made in China, also last longer.</br></br>In our advanced economy -- in which innovation and competition are pushing the prices of goods ever lower and their quality ever higher -- it's more affordable than ever to make your house into a winter wonderland.</br></br>Go ahead, light up your life.
Investors were quick to scoop up the latest new issue of global depositary shares from Samsung Electronics Co. No wonder: The South Korean chip maker is being billed as the cheapest semiconductor stock in the world.</br></br>Even those fund managers who prefer to be underweighted in South Korea right now admit they're fans of Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest producer of memory chips.</br></br>"Bottom up, we like Samsung Electronics," says Eric Sandlund, managing director of Prudential Portfolio Managers in Hong Kong. He says Prudential subscribed to the recent GDS offering even though he's keeping an underweighted position in the South Korean stock market overall.</br></br>"We like the company and it's trading at under six times [prospective 1995] earnings. Even if you take the view that the [semiconductor] industry is near the top of the cycle . . . it looks cheap," Mr. Sandlund says.</br></br>Indeed Samsung Electronics' low price/earnings ratio has analysts and investors swarming over the stock. "Why pay [13 to 14] times prospective earnings for a U.S. semiconductor stock when you can buy a similar company on the other side of the world, with potentially better earnings predictability and superior economies of scale, at only one-third of the price?" asks Namuh Rhee, vice president at J.P. Morgan Securities in Hong Kong, in a recent report on the company.
ASIA/PACIFIC</br></br>Japan's Production</br></br>Declines by 2.1%</br></br>Amid Global Slowing</br></br>Japan's industrial production in February dropped 2.1% from a year earlier but was up 0.4% from January, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The year-to-year monthly decline, the first since the spring of 1999, underscored the slowdown in manufacturing amid Japan's declining exports and the slowing global economy. The 0.4% month-to-month rise was a modest bounce from a record 4.2% decline in January, and was much weaker than economists' consensus forecast of a 1.7% rise. METI said it expects output this month to fall 0.8% from February, putting production on track to drop 3.3% for the January-March period -- the first quarterly decline since the spring of 1999 -- before a predicted 0.6% rebound in April.
DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co., saying it faces possible losses for the third and fourth quarters, moved to bolster its balance sheet by announcing plans to sell $1 billion of preferred stock.</br></br>The announcement surprised Wall Street analysts, who said that Ford has the best cash flow and liquidity of the Big Three auto makers. "Interest rates are low and I suppose they want to build up their war chest for capital spending," said David Healy, an analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co.</br></br>But Ford said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it expects a loss for the just-ended third quarter. Because of economic uncertainty in Europe, and the overall weakness in the U.S. market, Ford said "losses could extend into the fourth quarter," partially offsetting first-half earnings of $840.3 million. However, Ford said results for the full year should "represent a substantial improvement over 1991 losses" of $2.3 billion.</br></br>This week, Allan D. Gilmour, who heads Ford's world-wide automotive operations, said the company remains committed to its aggressive product development programs despite economic weakness in the U.S. and in Europe, where Ford expects a loss for the year.</br></br>"In spite of these weak markets, particularly in Europe, Ford is maintaining its aggressive commitment to invest the resources to bring to market good cars and trucks, and to develop practical, functional technology for these new products," Mr. Gilmour said in a speech at the Paris auto show.
Amid the chaos of recent days, as the federal government has taken gargantuan steps to stabilize the financial markets, realigning the U.S. economic system in the process, comes a nearly universal consensus: This crisis resulted from government reluctance to regulate the unbridled greed of Wall Street. Many economists and market participants who were formerly averse to government interference agree that a more robust regulatory framework must be constructed to cage the destructive forces of capitalism.</br></br>For the political left, which has long championed the need for such limits, this crisis is the opportunity of a lifetime.</br></br>Absent from such conclusions is the central role the government played in creating the crisis. Yes, many Wall Street leaders were irresponsible, and they should pay. But they were playing the distorted hand dealt them by government policies. Our leaders irrationally promoted home-buying, discouraged savings, and recklessly encouraged borrowing and lending, which together undermined our markets.</br></br>Just as prices in a free market are set by supply and demand, financial and real estate markets are governed by the opposing tension between greed and fear. Everyone wants to make money, but everyone is also afraid of losing what he has. Although few would ascribe their desire for prosperity to greed, it is simply a rose by another name. Greed is the elemental motivation for the economic risk-taking and hard work that are essential to a vibrant economy.</br></br>But over the past generation, government has removed the necessary counterbalance of fear from the equation. Policies enacted by the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Administration, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (which were always government entities in disguise), and others created advantages for home-buying and selling and removed disincentives for lending and borrowing. The result was a credit and real estate bubble that could only grow -- until it could grow no more.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 15ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Republican governors, their ranks thinned by the Nov. 2 midterm election, turned on President Reaganï¿½Ûªs representatives here today and blamed their losses on the nationwide unemployment problem and administration policies that are ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½scaring people to death.ï¿½Û</br></br>South Dakota Gov. William Jank-low, a conservative Republican, used that phrase in arguing with White House pollster Richard B. Wirthlinï¿½Ûªs claim that there is broad public support for Reaganï¿½Ûªs policies and the Republican Party faces ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no problem that canï¿½Ûªt be solved by a 3 percent growth rate.ï¿½Û</br></br>The 19 Republican governors gathered hereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½almost a third of whom will not be back in office next yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½listed a dozen other concerns, ranging from huge federal budget deficits, excessive military spending and a general perception that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Republicans care only about the richï¿½Û to antagonism of minorities and women, tolerance of narrow-focus, negative campaign groups, and what Janklow called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½screwball ideas" for changing Social Security.</br></br>, The public spanking of the administration by the Republican governors marked a political turning point. For the past two years, while some of them had grumbled privately about Reaganï¿½Ûªs spending priorities, they had strongly supported his efforts to slow the growth of the federal budget, cut taxes and shift programs back to the states.</br></br>Richard S. Williamson, the assistant to the president for intergovernmental relations and ranking administration official at the meeting, at-See GOVERNORS. A5, Col. 1 tributed the critical outburst to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nervousness about the Election results,ï¿½Û which reduced the number of GOP governors from 23 to 16 and left several of the survivors severely shaken.
Maybe some good will come out of Patrick Buchanan's candidacy. Maybe it will scare George Bush straight.</br></br>The president has been pretty badly rattled by Buchanan's guerrilla tactics. He is no match for them. Nor can he compete in right-ness. Bush, plainly panicked, threw a human sacrifice from the speeding sled, in a vain attempt to slow down the wolves. The sacking of John E. Frohnmayer, the National Endowment for the Arts chairman, was seen as appeasement of the most cowardly sort.</br></br>Bush is caught in a nightmare that has haunted him since 1980, when Ronald Reagan put him on the ticket with the understanding he remake himself in the conservative mode. Buchanan, on the other hand, is living a fantasy. He is getting large crowds and hoarse cheers in Georgia. He does provocative, wounding events, like a visit to a Confederate cemetery, and his followers cackle. He pointedly did not stop at the black cemetery across the street.</br></br>Bush cannot prevail in a contest in what Playboy magazine once referred to as Buchanan's "chain-saw politics." In his misery, he says less and less about more and more. On the day that General Motors named 12 of the 21 plants it will close, with a loss of 16,000 jobs, Bush did not mention it in his speeches. He put out a statement of regret through his press secretary. When he talks about economic recovery, he's all booster and bluster. "We are the United States of America," he says, grinning past the ghosts of decline and second-rateness.</br></br>He should draw inspiration from the Democrats, who are squabbling among themselves and tearing each other up in a way that could leave them scarred in November. But he does not think November. He is acting as if the entire electorate were composed of yahoos who want to savage gays and end welfare.
The ravages ot inflation on some real estate invesi-ment trusts was demon* strated sharply yesterday with reports by two area tirms, showing significant increases in potential loan losses:</br></br>The ravages ot inflation on some real estate invesi-ment trusts was demon* strated sharply yesterday with reports by two area tirms, showing significant increases in potential loan losses: ï¿½Û¢	First Virginia Mortgage and Real Estate Investment Trust of Falls Church, whose advisory firm is a subsidiary of First Virginia Bnnkshares Corp., revealed that about 21 per cent of all its loans are not accruing interest or are in foreclosure.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢	Commonwealth National Realty Trust of Rockville, established and advised by a subsidiary of Maryland National Corp., posted a loss of $1.78 million for the nine months ended Aug. 31, and increased its provision for potential loan losses to about $1.5 million from $990,000.</br></br>holding company which controls tlie largest bank in Northern Virginia, and by Marynat. which owns Maryland National Bank, largest in the Free State.</br></br>Ever since, record costs of borrowing money and a lack of permanent mortage funds have caused a growing number of defaults on building projects by developers, who canï¿½Ûªt pay off loans on timeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ aml'many of the loans came from the real estate investment trust industry.
Charlie Crist is the former governor of Florida. When he was governor he was a Republican. Now he's a Democrat and wants his old job back.</br></br>Mr. Crist is expected to kick off his gubernatorial bid on Monday, thereby completing his political reinvention. He left the GOP after sliding more than 20 points in the 2010 Republican Senate primary ultimately won by Marco Rubio. After losing the Senate race as an independent, he cozied up to Democratic fundraisers and party officials. Democrats embraced him notwithstanding the rank opportunism.</br></br>But then, Democrats may have their own cynical motives. Republican Gov. Rick Scott is one of their top targets in next year's midterm elections because of Florida's pivotal status as a presidential swing state. Mr. Scott, whose approval rating has consistently measured in the low 30s, also ranks as one of the country's most vulnerable governors. One reason: the governor's abrasive political style has alienated independents, which make up nearly a quarter of the state's electorate.</br></br>Meantime, polls going back more than a year have suggested that Mr. Crist would have a cake walk if he were to run for his old job as a Democrat. Public Policy Polling's survey last month showed Mr. Crist leading by 12 points with a 24-point advantage among independents. What's more, Democrats have no other standard-bearer with as much statewide name recognition, fundraising prowess or cachet among independents.</br></br>But the race could be a lot closer than the polls suggest. For starters, Mr. Scott can run on the state's robust economic recovery. He can point to the 500,000 jobs that Florida has added during his tenure compared to the 632,000 lost over Mr. Crist's four years in office. Meanwhile, the jobless rate has fallen to 7.0% from 10.9% since he entered office.
Victor Cohn's piece on "The Disgrace of American Health Care" {Cover Story, Jan. 24} did not mention a major factor in rising health care costs-the litigious atmosphere in which medicine is practiced today, coupled with astronomical awards in malpractice suits. His "Dr. Alarmist" would have a field day ordering tests-perhaps his patients would have benefited, but Dr. A. would then be armed for the almost inevitable confrontation of a malpractice suit.</br></br>Few responsible individuals in medicine, government or the legal profession deny that bad medicine is practiced; but advances in research have led Americans to deny that a "bad" result is possible.</br></br>Some states, such as California and Maryland, have already attempted to inject some common sense into the situation by capping "pain and suffering" awards, but the legal profession continues to tolerate members who demand settlements beyond believability. Locally, the result has been a sad drain of well qualified physicians to the suburbs, coupled with many simply retiring early and declining to put themselves in situations that can result in suits.</br></br>In your otherwise fine discussion of spiraling health care expenditures, you misuse the word "inflation," which refers to an increase in price unaccompanied by a commensurate increase in quality or quantity of goods or services.</br></br>When a nickel candy bar now costs 45 cents, that's inflation. When you buy a three-bedroom house inside the Beltway for $25,000 in 1960 and sell it for $250,000 today, that's inflation. When a Redskins ticket goes from $6 to $30 in a similar period . . . well, even though they win a few Super Bowls in the meantime, that's mostly inflation, too.
Squeezed by the recession, states are under great pressure to cut spending, and many have responded in part by reducing or proposing to reduce welfare benefits. This movement threatens to obscure the nascent effort, just entering its third year, to help mothers break their complete dependency on welfare through work. It is an effort that could also save money, though that isnï¿½Ûªt its major purpose.</br></br>Because welfare developments donï¿½Ûªt get much public attention, many people may have missed or forgotten the striking series of changes in federal policy designed to reduce welfare rolls by encouraging work.</br></br>The seminal legislation was the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. This legislation provided states with several billion dollars over five years to pay for education, training, child care and other services intended to help mothers leave welfare for workï¿½ï¿½ï¿½including one year of health benefits and day care after leaving welfare.</br></br>Congress and Presidents Reagan and Bush have collaborated on several other pieces of legislation designed to help promote work. The 1986 tax reform bill eliminated or dramatically reduced federal taxes for low-income workers. The bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an earnings subsidy paid by the federal government to low-income working families with children. In 1990 Congress and President Bush expanded the EITC even more. By 1994, many working families will be eligible for up to $2,400 in cash wage supplements.</br></br>We have also strengthened the nationï¿½Ûªs child support enforcement program, expanded federal support for day care and broadened government support for health insurance, all on a bipartisan basis.
The Senate opened debate on the Administrationï¿½Ûªs $11.6-billion tax-reduction bill yesterday with, a warning from opponents of possible inflation and a plea from supporters that the bill be passed quickly to avert a recession.</br></br>Chairman Harry F. Byrd (D-Va.) of the Finance Committee, an announced foe of the'bill, told the Senate nothing would please him more than to vote for a tax cut but that he could not support one that risked ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½massive debt and inflation.ï¿½Û</br></br>Sen. Russell B. Long (D-La.), named floor manager of the measure by Byrd, argued urgently, like Presidents Johnson and Kennedy before him, that the big tax cut is essential to maintain an expanding economy. Without such a stimulus, he said, the Nation risks an economic downturn at the end of the year.</br></br>"It wonï¿½Ûªt solve the problem of unemployment and depressed areas,ï¿½Û said Long. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It wonï¿½Ûªt solve the problem of poverty in America. What it will do is bring our economy to a point that we can do something about those problems.ï¿½Û</br></br>The drive for swift passage opened with about a dozen Senators on the floor. No votes are contemplate^ today, but a stretch-out schedule was planned for next week aimed at a final vote by Feb. 7 or 8. Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) has announced that the Senate will meet at 9 a.m. starting Monday and sit late in the Jevening. ' -
Mayor Anthony A. Williams petitioned the White House yesterday for $736 million in federal relief -- about five times what officials originally proposed -- to help the District recover from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and overhaul the city's emergency preparedness system.</br></br>In addition, the city wants $182 million for grants to protect streets, schools and technology infrastructure, according to a copy of the proposal provided to The Washington Post. In all, the city wants more than $900 million in federal aid.</br></br>The request submitted late yesterday was far more ambitious than the $150 million in federal assistance aired by Williams (D) at a D.C. Council hearing Friday. Council members assailed the sum as far too low for a city forced to confront massive costs for the exigencies of 21st-century terrorist threats and economic losses that followed the calamity.</br></br>The District is asking for $233 million for emergency preparedness and $503 million for economic recovery.</br></br>"Congress is already talking about a major stimulus, already talking about homeland security," the mayor said in an interview. "Obviously, the downside of this is that it's a significant amount of money."
U.S. stocks surged as investors focused on hopes for an economic and corporate upturn, rather than on news of more anthrax exposure in Washington.</br></br>The major indexes once again finished the day close to their highest points since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</br></br>"People are kind of adopting a stiff upper lip here, like the British in World War II," said stock trader Michael Driscoll at Credit Suisse First Boston. "They are focusing on the future and not looking at the past or the present. People are looking out six to 12 months and thinking that they don't see anything that will get a lot worse."</br></br>Technology stocks led the gains, with the Nasdaq Composite Index rising 2.2%, or 36.77 points, to 1708.08, just above its close of 1695.38 on Sept. 10, the day before the terrorist attacks. The index is almost back to the Oct. 16 level of 1722.07, the highest mark since last month's attacks.</br></br>Older industrial stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also put in strong gains, as did bank stocks. The Dow industrials advanced 1.88%, or 172.92 points, to 9377.03. That still is more than 200 points below the industrial average's Sept. 10 close of 9605.51, although it is close to the average's highest post-attack close, 9410.45, on Oct. 11.
AuthorAffiliation A Wall Street Journal News Roundup</br></br>Office-equipment stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry Groups, closing at 184.71, up 7.29, or 4.1%, with Ricoh of Japan posting a 7.4% gain in local currency. Specialty-retailing stocks trailed at 132.62, down 1.50, or 1.1%, with Circuit City Stores of the U.S. sliding 3.8%.</br></br>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which edged up 29.35 points Wednesday, climbed 283.99 to 20943.90. On Friday, the Nikkei lost 306.55 points to close the morning session at 20637.35. Thursday's first-section volume was estimated at 340 million shares, up from 277.6 million shares a day earlier. Rising issues widely outnumbered falling issues, 739 to 342. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first-section issues advanced 15.40 points to 1551.76.</br></br>Tokyo sectors chalking up strong gains included electronics, precision machinery, autos and pharmaceuticals, after Japan on Tuesday reported supportive data on Japan's gross domestic product for the quarter ended Sept. 30, though many investors remained unconvinced about momentum for economic recovery. The bourse also was helped by arbitrage-linked dealings by Japanese pension funds that bought stock-index futures. Foreign investors stepped up their buying after the U.S. dollar fell against the yen. Foreign funds had sold recently to avoid exchange-rate losses from a strong dollar.</br></br>In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index added 6.0 points to 4051.2, down from the session peak of 4076.0, though cushioned from the intraday low of 4043.8. The FT 30-stock index eased 2.0 points to 2797.1. Provisional volume was 818.6 million shares, compared with 653.6 million shares a day earlier.
U.S. stock futures pared their premarket gains but remained higher, as investors scrutinized an agreement among most European Union members to tighten fiscal coordination and eyed some disappointing U.S. corporate outlooks.</br></br>Less than an hour before Friday's opening bell, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures had risen 43 points, or 0.4%, to 11987. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures climbed five points, or 0.4%, to 1235 and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced six points, or 0.2%, to 2287.</br></br>Changes in stock futures don't always accurately predict stock moves after the opening bell.</br></br>The Dow is on pace to finish the week with meager gains. On Thursday, the blue-chip index suffered its biggest point drop in two weeks, falling 199 points to below 12000 for the first time since Nov. 29.</br></br>On Friday, investors grew optimistic after 23 of 27 European Union countries agreed to tougher fiscal rules, which led German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy to push for a separate intergovernmental treaty.
U.S. stock prices edged fractionally higher in thin trading after the Tokyo stock market plunged below an important threshold. Bond prices eased and the dollar was mixed.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average eked out a gain of 0.45 to 3236.36 in lackluster trading. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.55 to 406.39. But the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.68 to 617.94.</br></br>Traders in the U.S. were braced for some selling after the Nikkei index fell below the psychologically important 20,000 level to 19,837.16, the lowest it has been since February 1987. The decline in Tokyo indicated investors expect Japan's weakening economy to get worse before improving.</br></br>The Japanese market's effect on U.S. stocks was depressing, keeping the industrials in negative territory until moments before the closing bell. Absence of news about the U.S. economy held trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange to a relatively slim 151.3 million shares.</br></br>Traders said investors are awaiting several economic releases this morning, including housing starts, industrial production and consumer prices, all for February. If projections are accurate, the data could lift stock prices more: Both housing starts and industrial production are expected to show some strength and consumer prices to rise modestly.
Easy Money Tugs Two Ways at Trade Gap</br></br>The trade deficit is a case study in the unintended consequences of easy money.</br></br>The Commerce Department releases April trade data Wednesday morning. Economists think the deficit widened a bit, to $29 billion, from $27.6 billion in March. That would end an eight-month streak of narrower deficits that has cut the gap roughly in half, thanks first to a surge in exports and then to tumbling oil prices.</br></br>A narrower trade deficit is potentially good economic news on several fronts. For one, from an accounting perspective, exports add to gross domestic product, while imports subtract from it. From a fundamental standpoint, it is often healthier for a country to export more than it imports -- though collapsing imports can also signal weak demand at home, as they have in this recession.</br></br>Here's where the unintended consequences of fighting that recession come in: The money being pumped into the economy by the Federal Reserve has made some investors anxious about inflation, sometimes defined as the result of too much money chasing too few goods.
So many job seekers are like Myra Walker, living in the city without a car. So many employers are like Frank Hearl Jr. of the Dulles Airport Marriott, based in a suburb where nearly everybody already has a job.</br></br>A job fair yesterday in the Reeves Center, at 14th and U streets NW, brought together people like Walker and Hearl in an attempt to solve a problem faced by the region for decades: Most new jobs are in the suburbs, while most of the unemployed are in the city.</br></br>More than 650 applicants from the city, where unemployment is 6 percent, showed up for about 500 jobs in the Dulles corridor, where unemployment is less than 1.5 percent.</br></br>Putting city job seekers in touch with suburban recruiters was only part of the plan, since even when District residents know of work outside the Capital Beltway, many have no way of getting there. So the job fair was timed to coincide with Monday's start of a Metro bus route between L'Enfant Plaza and Dulles International Airport. The buses are to run hourly from 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., seven days a week, with fares of $1.10 each way.</br></br>"I just felt like it was a blessing," said Walker, 38, who lives in Petworth and was looking for a customer service position. "If the jobs are in Virginia, it's a good thing they come here to recruit."
I have to wonder whether our school system understands the mixed messages it keeps sending out. I find it ironic that we parents are told that our children need their sleep, then they have to get up at 6 to catch the bus; or that our children are overweight and need to be outside playing and getting exercise, but they are given homework and projects every night.</br></br>We are told that knowing whom our children are hanging out with is important, but because of some idiotic home project, we have to send them to a house we know nothing about. We are told that having a home-cooked meal at the table as a family is important, but we are forced to run to Staples to buy more poster board and spend all night working with the children on a project that is way over their heads.</br></br>We are told their backpacks are too heavy, and then the teachers load them down with books. A little help from the school system would be nice, such as moving back the start of school, agreeing that home projects are a complete waste of time, that a child getting play time really is important. Don't they understand I am trying to raise a person, not Standards of Learning scores?</br></br>You have laced several issues together in a compelling way. I would love to hear what other parents, as well as students and educators, think of this.</br></br>Do you have any idea whether there is state law or Fairfax County public schools policy regarding how long students are allowed to be on the bus during their commutes to and from school?
Now that Bill Clinton's vow to cut the federal budget deficit has moved from the campaign-promise arena to the real-money stage, itï¿½Ûªs time to take a hard look at the areas in which he has suggested he might find revenue.</br></br>One of them is a revenue source that has long tantalized liberal economists and legislators: the capital gains that Americans accumulate during their lives and then pass on to their heirs, often untouched by the income tax.</br></br>These gains amount to hundreds of billions of dollars, and Clinton has expressed interest in taxing them.</br></br>But like a lot of the budget measures that seem obvious when viewed from outside the Beltway, this one is fraught with complications.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢ you ownï¿½ï¿½ï¿½such as a stock, a bond, real estate, iart and the likeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and what you paid for it ; (along with adjustments for improvements or depreciation).
As its final hours of solvency ticked away Monday night, Drexel Burnham Lambert's top executives still clung to the hope that the Bush administration would send some signal that it wanted the beleaguered Wall Street firm to survive. Such a signal might coax worried bankers and lenders to give Drexel more breathing room in meeting hundreds of millions of dollars in loan obligations.</br></br>But late Monday, Drexel got a different message. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden and E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York-two officials who might have led a rescue party for Drexel-telephoned to say that no help was coming, according to sources close to the discussions.</br></br>Breeden told Drexel Chief Executive Frederick Joseph that senior Bush administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, had concluded that the best step for Drexel and the financial markets was a bankruptcy filing, the sources said. To delay would only add to the risk that Drexel's financial plight would shake investor confidence, causing a much wider, more dangerous problem for Wall Street, Breeden reportedly told Joseph. At the same time, Breeden acknowledged that the decision was up to Drexel's board of directors.</br></br>The next day, Drexel threw in the towel, announcing first that it was defaulting on $100 million in loans, and later, that the parent company was filing for bankruptcy protection-a preliminary step toward an expected dissolution of the firm.</br></br>Thus, the Bush administration added another chapter to the longstanding, often hostile relationship between Wall Street and Washington.
Preventive services for the chronically ill may reduce health-care costs, but they are unlikely to generate the kind of fantastic savings that President Obama and other Democrats have said could help pay for an overhaul of the nation's health system, according to a study being published Tuesday.</br></br>Using data from long-standing clinical trials, researchers projected the cost of caring for people with Type 2 diabetes as they progress from diagnosis to various complications and death. Enrolling federally-insured patients in a simple but aggressive program to control the disease would cost the government $1,024 per person per year -- money that largely would be recovered after 25 years through lower spending on dialysis, kidney transplants, amputations and other forms of treatment, the study found.</br></br>However, except for the youngest diabetics, the additional services would add to overall health spending, not decrease it, the study shows.</br></br>"There's no free lunch here. Prevention will not pay for everything. But it's not as expensive as it looks at first blush," said Michael J. O'Grady, a senior fellow at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, and one of four authors whose work is being published on the Web site of Health Affairs, a leading journal of health policy research.</br></br>The study comes a week before lawmakers are due back in Washington to continue the debate over Obama's signature domestic initiative, a debate that has come to focus heavily on cost. With budget deficits soaring in the wake of a global recession, Republican critics -- and a growing number of moderate Democrats -- say the nation cannot afford a vast expansion of the health-care system unless it includes measures to reduce federal spending on care over the long term.
Secretary of Commerce Charles W. Sawyer said yesterday that a Korean truce might have a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½minor effectï¿½Û on the Nationï¿½Ûªs economy but that he does not foresee any major recession ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½in the near future.ï¿½Û</br></br>Sawyer also said the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½guns and butterï¿½Û defense program has been handled ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½excellently." He said Americans should be able to buy just about all the automobiles and other consumer gbods they want this year if they are willing to pay the price.</br></br>Simultaneously, the Agriculture Department said production of major civilian appliances ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½radios, washing machines and refrigeratorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½will be about as big during the first six months of this year as during the comparable period of 1947-49 despite defense cutbacks.</br></br>Sawyer*conceded the switch to war production has resulted in widespread unemployment in some areas such as Detroit and New York. But he said the situation would have been much worse if all civilian production had been halted as some have urged.</br></br>He said the changeover from peacetime output has been made as rapidly as the armed services could let odrers and that not one more plane or gun would have been produced if the auto-moblie industry had been shut down completely.
THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM, over the past generation, has had three strong chairmenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Marriner S. Eccles, William M. Martin and Arthur F. Burns. Mr. Ecclesï¿½Ûªs death last week recalls the long struggles between the Fed and the White House in the years just before and after World War H. The issues of that time are still alive today, especially with Dr. Burnsï¿½Ûªs term as chairman now about to expire.</br></br>The Fed is almost a fourth branch of government, exercising its great power under a board of governors serving 14-year terms. An appointment to the Fed is a bit like an appointment to the Supreme Court: Once the nominee takes his seat, a President can no longer give him orders; he can only argue with him. By his choice of candidates, the President transmits a signalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and an important oneï¿½ï¿½ï¿½indicating his purposes in economic policy.</br></br>Mr. Eccles was a Utah banker who came to the administrationï¿½Ûªs attention in 1933 with a speech endorsing deficit financing. He had begun to work out for himself the central ideas of modern fiscal managementï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a remarkable intellectual featï¿½ï¿½ï¿½at a time when they were hardly known, let alone accepted, in this country. President Roosevelt advanced the influence of those ideas when, the following year, he put Mr. Eccles on the Federal Reserve Board. But very shortly Mr. Eccles was publicly at odds with the administration over the independence of the Fed.</br></br>The issue returned, sharper than ever, after World War II when President Truman wanted the Fed to continue the wartime practice of holding up the prices of federal securities. Holding up prices meant holding down interest rates, and it also meant turning the Fed into a subsidiary of the U.S. Treasury. In 1948 the President refused to reappoint Mr. Eccles chairman of the board. Why? Robert J. Donovan, in his recent history of the period, suggests that the reasons went beyond pure policy and Mr. Ecclesï¿½Ûªs increasingly cautious views. As a Truman aide told Mr. Donovan, the White House felt that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½in general, the Fed had too much power, that it should be cut down</br></br>that he had wanted Mr. Eccles to know ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whoï¿½Ûªs boss.ï¿½Û That was in character. But was the President right? The country had just been through a great surge of postwar inflation, and Mr. Eccles was a strong advocate of anti-inflationary credit restraints..But 1948 was an election year, and economic growth was far from assured; as it turned out, the economy tipped into a recession a year later. The country needed more thin an anti-inflation program.
Moving even faster than the Federal Reserve apparently wants, several of the nationï¿½Ûªs largest banks raised their prime lending rate yesterday from 14V2 percent to 15 percent, another record.</br></br>Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, the countryï¿½Ûªs fifth largest bank, acted first. Other large banks in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia immediately followed suit.</br></br>Only two weeks ago, the prime rate, which banks charge their most creditworthy corporate customers, rose from 13Y2 percent to 14J/2 percent after a series of Federal Reserve actions reducing credit availability in an attempt to curb inflation.</br></br>Now rates to most borrowers are rising. Mortgage rates at some California savings and loan associations, for example, are 14 percent, and in some parts of the country, mortgage money is becoming difficult to find at any price.</br></br>In other economic news yesterday, two more major oil companies announced big increases in their third-quarter profits. Gulf Oil Corp., lifth largest among the majors, said its net income rose 97 percent from the comparable quarter a year ago to $416 million. At Conoco inc., the ninth largest, profits jumped 133 percent to $247.1 million.
The U.S. economy continued to grow rapidly last month, but the growth is not adding much to inflation, according to two government reports released yesterday.</br></br>Retail sales rose 1.2 percent last month - about twice what many analysts had expected - as consumers stepped up their purchases of new cars, light trucks, furniture and building supplies, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>On the strength of November's sales report, and upward revisions for September and October that were announced yesterday, forecasters said the growth rate for the three months from October through December should hit 4 percent or more despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to slow that pace by raising short-term interest rates. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and other central bank officials have said that if growth does not slow, the economy will overheat and cause inflation to accelerate.</br></br>But the other report out yesterday - on the prices producers charge when they first sell completed goods - showed few signs of added inflation.</br></br>The Labor Department said the producer price index rose 0.5 percent last month largely because of a large upswing in gasoline and some other energy prices. Falling energy prices had led the index to declines of a half-percentage point in each of the previous two months.
Your Oct. 26 editorial "Accusations in Manila" stated that some liberals in the Congress, including me, have been sending the wrong message to Manila by urging cuts in U.S. military aid. I strongly disagree.</br></br>Before taking any action on economic or military aid to the Philippines, the Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, which I chair, held several hearings with prominent, independent experts. There was a consensus among them that the severe economic crisis confronting the Philippines is potentially far more dangerous in the short run than the long-term threat posed by the Communist-dominated New People's Army. Unless this economic challenge is effectively addressed, the possibility of an economic collapse cannot be precluded. Under such circumstances, the ensuing chaos would certainly lead to political instability, and play directly into the hands of the Communist insurgents, whose ranks would be appreciably swelled by the victims of the collapse.</br></br>The growth of the NPA in recent years has been a function primarily of the deterioration in the economy. Most knowledgeable observers agree that, at the margin, the Philippine Government can more effectively counter the spread of Communism with additional economic aid to deal with economic problems rather than with additional military aid, which is unlikely to be used by the corrupt and brutal military establishment any more effectively now than it has been in the past.</br></br>On the basis of this testimony, the Subcommittee decided it was more appropriate for the U.S. to provide additional grant economic assistance rather than additional military loans that would just increase the Philippines' already onerous debt.</br></br>Therefore, the Subcommittee and later the full House decided that $60 million in military loans should be deferred this year, and that economic assistance should be increased by the same amount. Thus, under our proposal there was no net cut in aid but only a change in the mix.
Recent conversations with Chinese leaders have convinced me that the Congress of the Chinese Communist Party that has just opened in Beijing is likely to mark the rare example of a ruling group that voluntarily diminishes its dominant position. Of course the scope of government in a country of 1 billion population is comparable to nothing else. The majority of Chinaï¿½Ûªs provinces each has a population larger than those of the most populous European states. Most of Chinaï¿½Ûªs dynasties have each lasted longer than the entire history of the United States. China thus has a perspective all its own. About no other society would it be possible to repeat the apocryphal story of a Chinese leaderï¿½Ûªs reply to the question of what he thought of the French Revolution: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It is too early to tell."</br></br>The task of governing China is made all the more daunting by its peopleï¿½Ûªs extraordinary mix of individualism and fierce sense of cultural uniqueness. Rulers have often despaired of achieving coherence by any means other than monolithic rule only to be submerged in the end by the elemental common sense of that multitude that defends its fundamental values by patient endurance. At the height of his power, when complimented by Nixon on having changed the face of China, Mao replied: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½No, I have only changed Beijing and a few of its environs.ï¿½Û I thought then he was being polite; I now know he was prophetic.</br></br>Indeed Maoï¿½Ûªs intuition of the ultimate futility of his doctrinal obsessions caused him to unleash the frenzy of the Cultural Revolution. But in the end the Chinese people outlasted the violent attempt to impose an unnatural conformity by destroying all ancient values. Ironically, the Cultural Revolution brought about the exact opposite of its intention: it guaranteed reform. Every contemporary Chinese leader has survived a decade of degradation, imprisonment and deprivation. Far from being broken by the ordeal, they emerged serenely determined to reform the system that made such suffering possible.</br></br>This legacy is the principal reason to be optimistic about the poignant task Deng Xiaoping has set for himself: to abandon, at the end of his life as a revolutionary, his movementï¿½Ûªs quest to bend reality to theory. Deng is fond of saying that he is neither a reformer nor a conservative, but someone ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½who has sought truth from facts.ï¿½Û</br></br>That truth as it will emerge at the party congress is likely to contradict almost every previous Communist practice elsewhere: it will reject detailed central planning; it will implement two principles that are revolutionary in Communist terms: that a Communist state can prosper only if the Communist Party abandons the detailed supervision of government and if the government loosens its grip over the economy.
President-elect Jimmy Carter's proposed tax and spending program is probably too modest to enable him to reach his goals of lowering the unemployment rate to (5.5 per cent by yearï¿½Ûªs end and boosting the economic growth rate to (5 per cent, three leading economists testified yesterday.</br></br>None of the economistsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½including the director of the Congressional Budget Office and two former chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½called the program inadequate, but each implied that the amount of economic stimulus it contained was too little.</br></br>An analysis of a set of proposals similar to Carterï¿½Ûªs by Congressional Budget Office director Alice Rivlin indicated the President-elect Could reach his targets only it every "optimisticï¿½Û assumption in her forecast came true.</br></br>And both economic advisersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Paul McCracken, who headed President Nixonï¿½Ûªs council, and Walter W. Iiellcr, headed the Kemicdy-Johnson ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ called for programs bigger than the one proposed late last week by Carter.</br></br>Their testimony came before the Senate Budget Committee which is considering whether to revise the budget it adopted last September because the economy is weaker than it was predicted to be.
The Federal Reserve continues to work on the plumbing that will eventually drain the flood of cash it has pumped into the financial system.</br></br>On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced it was further broadening the pool of those eligible to take part in reverse-repurchase agreements, expected to be a key tool the Fed will use to exit from the accommodative policy stance it has been in since the financial crisis hit in 2008.</br></br>The criteria set forth Tuesday would allow U.S. government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to apply to participate in reverse-repurchase agreements, in which the central bank sells securities from its portfolio to counterparties with an agreement to buy them back later.</br></br>Under the arrangement, the buyers essentially lend cash to the Fed, removing reserves from the system.</br></br>"They're sharpening their tools here. I don't think it means that they're going to [make any move to tighten policy] sooner," said Raymond Stone, economist at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, an economic and bond-market research firm. "They just want to make sure when the time comes they have tools to do it."
Looks like there has been some international coordination of monetary policy rhetoric lately.</br></br>At the beginning of the week, the central bankers' central bank -- the Bank for International Settlements in Basel -- warned loudly of the risks of moving "too slowly and too late" to raise interest rates back toward normal. As it did before the global financial crisis, the BIS emphasized the need to act early to avoid the booms-and-busts in financial markets and offered all sorts of reasons why today's very low inflation shouldn't be the primary concern of central bankers.</br></br>Central bankers appear to have agreed on a common response.</br></br>In the past couple of days, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of England deputy governor Jon Cunliffe have used the same phrases to say: Fuggedaboutit!</br></br>With price and wage inflation not a concern right now, we aren't going to raise interest rates and throw at lot of people out of work to avoid excesses in financial markets or to head off possible asset bubbles, they said. There may come a day when our worries about financial stability will prompt us to hike interest rates, but rates are "the last line of defense." Not now. The "first line of defense" is making the financial system more resilient so it can better withstand shocks and using our supervisory and regulatory "macroprudential tools" to rein in excesses, as we are doing now.
In an election driven by pocketbook issues, the economic conditions of the states in the South's Super Tuesday sweepstakes present a very different picture from the recession-battered landscape of the nation's first primary state, New Hampshire. Job conditions in general are stable, and the Southwest, in particular, is showing new signs of life.</br></br>Within the Sun Belt, however, there are important economic differences, none more marked than those between the region's two giants, Texas and Florida.</br></br>Texas, the only part of the United States that was ever an independent nation, continues to go its contrary way, slowly crawling out of the first wave of the real estate recession that later washed over much of the rest of the country. Florida, on the other hand, is suffering its own real estate and banking collapse at the same time that hard times elsewhere in the country are cutting into its giant tourist industry.</br></br>How these varied economic conditions will affect the fortunes of the candidates on Tuesday remains uncertain, however.</br></br>In New Hampshire, which propelled Paul E. Tsongas to the front of the Democratic pack, 64 percent of those responding to a Voter Research & Surveys (VRS) exit poll said they thought the national economy was in poor shape. A little farther south, Tsongas got another boost from Democrats in Maryland, where 53 percent of those questioned in exit polls said the economy was in poor condition. In Georgia, where 50 percent of those questioned by VRS declared the economy to be in poor shape - the lowest percentage of the three states - Bill Clinton got the nod from Democratic voters.
Stocks broke out of a narrow trading range today to post their biggest gain in nearly two weeks as buyers flocked to companies reporting strong earnings and other blue-chip issues.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 31.08 points, or just over 1 percent, to end at 3016.32. The Dow's biggest rise since a gain of 37.56 points July 18 brought it again above the key 3000 level. The 30-share index reached its highest closing level ever at 3035.33 on June 3.</br></br>In the broader market, gaining stocks outnumbered losing issues by a ration of 2 to 1. New York Stock Exchange volume was an active 169.0 million shares.</br></br>In addition to strength in individual blue chips, rising stock prices in Europe and a solid U.S. bond market helped fuel the advance, market analysts said. Computer-driven buy programs also bolstered the market.</br></br>"You might say the market accepted some of the positives it had been rejecting just a few days ago, namely strengthening overseas markets, the strong dollar and firm bonds," said Robert Stovall, a principal at Stovall/21st Advisers.
The stock market rode t'he roller coaster of events in Washington yesterday as investors focused their attention on President Nixonï¿½Ûªs survival in office.</br></br>The prospect of an early presidential resignation and an end to the nationï¿½Ûªs protracted Watergate trauma shot the Dow Jones industrial average up nearly 26,points in the first half hour of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>But stocks gave up half of that gain after President Nixon told a mid-day cabinet meeting that he would not leave office voluntarily. -</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials ended the day up 13.38 points at 773.78. Volume totaled a brisk 15.77 million shares, up from the 11.23 million shares traded the day before. Six million shares changed hands in the first hour yesterday but trading tapered off after that.</br></br>The advance, on top of a 7.82-point gain on Monday, was broad-based with nearly three times as many issues rising as declining. The ratio had been more than 12 to 1 early in the day.
ILLIAM McChesney Martin Jr., has a stocky physique and a calm temperament. They suit a worriful job. If Martin doesnï¿½Ûªt have inflation to worry about, itï¿½Ûªs deflation. And if it isnï¿½Ûªt deflation or inflation, itï¿½Ûªs just plain flationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½</br></br>A year ago. when production was still at a high level (145 in the Reserve Board index) and unemployment was comparatively lo\y (under 3 million), Martin, as Federal Reserve Board chairman, worried about rising pricesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½inflation. So, he and his six confreres kept a halter on credit.</br></br>They were going to stretch out prosperity and prevent speculation from bursting into a boom followed by a bust.	,</br></br>Reserve Board were not and are not ready to subscribe to .inflation as a permanent way of life in America, as the new 2 per cent-a-year era.</br></br>Then came the recession.

Then, in April, the business decline came to a brusque halt. Overnight Martinï¿½Ûªs worry changed. He mustnï¿½Ûªt let credit flow too freely.
Republican legislators accused the Democratic governor and General Assembly leaders today of undermining attempts to cut state payrolls by giving backdoor pay raises to state employees and adding contract workers.</br></br>In an analysis distributed to lawmakers at a budget briefing, the bipartisan Department of Fiscal Services showed a drop of 2,272 regular state employees from July 1990 to July 1992, while the cost of the total payroll remained virtually unchanged. And while the regular state work force declined, the number of contract employees rose by nearly 1,000.</br></br>Gov. William Donald Schaefer and the legislature, trying to reduce state spending during the recession, have refused to give state workers a "step" or merit pay raise in the last two years.</br></br>But critics said that 6,000 employees received new job classifications last year, an undetermined number of them leading to promotions and higher wages.</br></br>"The implication over the last two years has been that the fat was cut from government, but it looks like government as usual," said Del. C. Ronald Franks (R-Eastern Shore), a member of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Managers of some red-hot small-company stock funds are cautioning investors that returns could start to cool off.</br></br>For the past three years, small-cap funds have been the top performers among diversified funds, according to Morningstar Inc.</br></br>The biggest winners: small-company funds focusing on growth stocks. So far in 2011, small-growth funds are up an average of 13%, Morningstar says. That follows an average 27% return in 2010 and 35% in 2009. Many funds have completely recovered losses from the bear market of 2007-09, when the average small-growth fund lost nearly 42%.</br></br>In contrast, large-cap stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, are up 8.4% (about 9% including dividends) so far this year, and plenty of large-cap stock funds are still in the red from the bear market.</br></br>This has some fund managers turning a bit cautious. "We're still positively biased . . . but we feel we have had the bulk of the returns" we expected for 2011, says Mark Burns, a portfolio manager on Loomis Sayles Small Cap Growth, up 17% so far this year and 37% over the past year.
Try to ignore the storm-warning flags and enjoy the fourth quarter, because 1999 may be a batten-down-the-hatches year.</br></br>That's the advice of most economists as the Southeast wraps up its eighth consecutive year of economic expansion.</br></br>The region's gross state product -- the value of all goods and services -- will still grow at a respectable 3.7% annual rate in the next three months, ahead of the 2.8% pace forecast for the nation as a whole, according to eight economists recruited by The Wall Street Journal to forecast the Southeast's economic output.</br></br>Among the reasons for the near-term optimism: Interest rates at decade lows, lean inventories and payrolls, and an influx of retirees, second-home buyers and tourists from Tennessee's Great Smoky Mountains to Florida's Sanibel Island.</br></br>But with the exception of one shooting star -- South Carolina -- the Southeast's other five states are slowly losing their luster. Just last quarter, the panel of economists predicted growth of 4% for the six-state region.
U.S. stocks rose last week, producing the first three-month gain for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since 2007, as commodities posted the biggest monthly rally since 1974 on bets that an economic recovery will boost demand for fuel, metals and crops.</br></br>Cabot Oil & Gas rose 18 percent, leading energy shares 5 percent higher as crude completed its biggest monthly gain in a decade. CIT Group and SanDisk led financial and technology firms to the steepest advances among 10 industries in the S&P 500 as consumer confidence climbed the most since 2003.</br></br>"The summer doldrums are being washed away by optimism that the economy didn't slip into a permanent black hole," said Diane Garnick, the New York-based investment strategist at Invesco. "Prices on inputs to business such as oil and natural resources are rising on the hopes of an economic turnaround."</br></br>The S&P 500 rallied 3.6 percent, to 919.14, continuing a rebound from a 5 percent loss two weeks earlier that was the steepest weekly loss since March. The Dow Jones industrial average added 223.01 points, or 2.7 percent, to finish at 8500.33. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.9 percent, to close at 1774.33.</br></br>U.S. Steel surged 16 percent and Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold gained 13 percent, leading gains among raw-materials producers.
LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Worthen Banking Corp. disclosed that bank regulators view the company's condition as "unsatisfactory" and listed six of its banks as "problem" institutions.</br></br>Worthen, Arkansas's largest banking company, disclosed that it replaced its longstanding independent accountants last year after a series of disagreements concerning the adequacy of its 1985 loan-loss allowance and disclosure of lawsuits against Worthen, among other things.</br></br>Worthen, with $2.1 billion assets and 10 banking units, was reviewed by the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Arkansas bank regulators. As a result, bank regulators have increased their scrutiny of Worthen by requiring it to submit various written plans, policies and procedures to the St. Louis Fed, including its so-far unsuccessful attempt to name a chairman of the company, its debt-service plans, capital levels and its business plan for the remainder of 1987 and 1988.</br></br>Moreover, Worthen must enlist an independent management consultant to review its organization and management structure and report back to the St. Louis Fed. Worthen also must either charge off as losses or collect all loans or parts of loans that it classified as losses by last Sept. 30. The regulators examined the condition of the company as of that date.</br></br>Worthen signed a regulatory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank last March, and made a brief public announcement of the action at the time. However, it didn't disclose that bank regulators took a dim view of its operations and the "problem" status of seven of its bank units, one of which it sold this year.
Author: Edward P. Lazear</br></br>As Washington debates the fate of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, many lawmakers have fallen into a logical trap of their own making. Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.</br></br>This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.</br></br>To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an "inflation-minus-one" rule to constrain future spending increases.</br></br>Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in the journal American Economic Review, such high debt-to-GDP ratios are associated with low growth.

NEW YORK -- The April producer price index due out Friday will take the temperature of inflation, which many economists believe is rising.</br></br>Analysts figure the index rose for the second month in a row, although possibly at a slower rate than March's 0.6% gain. MMS International, a Redwood City, Calif.-based research firm, says its poll shows an increase of 0.3% to 0.6% is expected.</br></br>Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, the index has been rising steadily this year at a "disconcerting rate" of about 0.4% a month, economists at Merrill Lynch & Co. say. That pace, among other things, prompts them to expect an annual inflation rate of about 5% by year end.</br></br>Few are predicting a return to the double-digit inflation that plagued the economy in the late 1970s, but many economists say signs of mildly troublesome inflation are mounting. For several years now, inflation as measured through the consumer price index has been mild. It started to decline after reaching 13.5% in 1980, slid to 10.3% the following year and to 6.2% in 1982. It was 3.6% last year after slowing all the way down to 1.4% in 1986.</br></br>These days, "the biggest 'fin in the water' is the purchasing managers' data," Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch, says.
The amount of money Americans gave to charities in 1991 plunged to its lowest level in at least five years, as the recession squeezed household budgets and confidence in the United Way and other nonprofits sagged, according to a new national survey.</br></br>Billed as the most comprehensive look at charitable-giving patterns to date, the survey for a Washington-based group of charitable organizations said the typical U.S. household gave $649 to charities, churches and other nonprofit groups last year, down from the average $806 donation in 1990.</br></br>The 1991 figure, which was adjusted for inflation, marked the smallest average giving amount since the Gallup polling organization began surveying households for the Independent Sector, an umbrella group serving nonprofit groups nationwide.</br></br>The latest poll of 2,600 people, which surveyed giving on the basis of age, race and income, seemed to confirm what many charities in the Washington area and elsewhere already have experienced: Meager increases or declines in giving, as the lean economy has pushed demand for food, shelter and other services to record levels.</br></br>This year, the picture has grown even more bleak because thousands of charities receive most of their funds through the auspices of United Way, whose national organization was rocked by scandal.
Washington -- Contrary to popular belief, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is capable of speaking clearly. A case in point was earlier this month, up on Capitol Hill, when he held forth on the mundane but vital issue of pricing.</br></br>"A striking feature" of the current economic cycle, the Fed chairman said, "has been the virtual absence of pricing power across much of American business."</br></br>Well said, Mr. Chairman. Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve "pricing power" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare "service" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.</br></br>But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs "the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy."</br></br>Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming. When will the discounting, rebating and price-cutting reverse course? What happens if industries shutter excess factories around the world or if inventories are trimmed? What happens to prices if industries become more concentrated oligopolies?
a MCI Communications Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. yesterday signed a definitive agreement for MCI to purchase virtually all assets and operations of Satellite Business Systems, the IBM-owned communications company, in exchange for about 16.6 percent of MCI stock, or 46.7 million shares.	ï¿½Û¢</br></br>IBM previously announced it would invest an additional $400 million in MCI. That investment will be made between Sept. 1, 1986, and Dec. 31, 1988, spokesmen for the companies said.</br></br>Completion of the transaction is subject to approval by both the Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	Beatrice Cos. Inc. is urging shareholders not to act on a $4.9 billion leveraged-buyout offer from the New York investment company Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co. until directors can consider it. Officials at Beatrice, one of the worldï¿½Ûªs largest food and consumer-products companies, said in a statement that consideration will follow ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½appropriate analysis by the companyï¿½Ûªs management and advisers.ï¿½Û</br></br>The Beatrice board is expected to meet Sunday to review the takeover offer, according to Wall Street sources quoted by Reuters, which also reported that at least two of Beatriceï¿½Ûªs six inside directors were studying the possibility of making a management-led buyout offer for the company. The two directors, David Lipson and Richard Pigott, both executive vice presidents, have retained the firm of Goldman Sachs and Co. to advise them, the sources said.
Billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian said he has added $100 million to his funds for buying shares of Ford Motor a day after the automaker abandoned its forecast that it will return to profitability next year.</br></br>Kerkorian may borrow as much as $600 million from Bank of America, an increase from $500 million, according to a regulatory filing by his investment company, Tracinda. Tracinda said last month it bought 100 million shares, or 4.6 percent, and on May 9 it began an offer to buy 20 million more at $8.50 each. That would bring Kerkorian's Ford stake to 5.5 percent.</br></br>He said Ford officials "would be agreeable" to meeting with him. Ford's board has taken a neutral stance on Tracinda's tender offer, which runs through June 9 unless it's extended.</br></br>Investigators at Societe Generale said they suspect a former futures trader had help as he tried to cover up unauthorized positions that led to more than $7 billion worth of losses at the French bank. In two reports, investigators said the bank's management failures and culture of risk-taking were partly to blame for failing to uncover the alleged fraud.</br></br>"The trader's hierarchy, constituting the first level of control, proved deficient in the supervision of his activities," the board of directors said in a statement to shareholders accompanying the reports.
WASHINGTON -- The economy continued to sizzle last month, but cast off few sparks indicating overheating.</br></br>The latest evidence of vigor: Payrolls swelled by 339,000 in February, the biggest one-month jump since May, the Labor Department said. The first major official statistical portrait for the month also showed that the unemployment rate slipped 0.1 point to 5.3% -- putting it below 5.5% for the ninth month in a row.</br></br>In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said consumer credit rose at an 8.4% annual rate in January, the biggest jump since August. The rise, which included a sharp boost in credit-card use, seems to confirm recent reports of growing household spending and consumer confidence.</br></br>Financial markets rallied on the employment data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 56.19, or 0.81%, to 7000.89, Friday, while the 30-year Treasury bond rose 26/32 point, pushing the yield down to 6.81%.</br></br>Most economists -- from Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan on down -- believe that the booming economy, especially the strong labor market, will eventually push up wages and then ignite inflation. And with Mr. Greenspan having told Congress earlier in the week that he continues to remain vigilant for any warning signs that might force him to boost interest rates later this month, the markets were examining the tiniest details of Friday's releases for any glimpse of inflation.
DALLAS -- Carrington Laboratories Inc., citing the stock market's plunge, said it agreed to cancel a plan to receive a cash infusion from its newly appointed chairman and chief executive officer, Thomas J. Marquez.</br></br>Mr. Marquez, a former senior executive of Electronic Data Systems Inc., took the helm of the medical products maker in August after agreeing to purchase $5 million in unregistered common stock at half price or $15 a share, whichever is less. He agreed to increase his Carrington investment to $7.5 million by Nov. 30 under the same terms.</br></br>Mr. Marquez had so far purchased 266,667 shares for $4 million, giving him a 12.4% stake in the company.</br></br>At the time the agreement was reached, Carrington's stock was trading in the mid-$30 to high-$30 range. But Carrington has taken a beating since the stock market crash Oct. 19, plunging more than 50%. In national over-the-counter trading, Carrington closed yesterday at $17.25, down 25 cents.</br></br>Carrington said the stock market crash would force it to issue a number of shares under the agreement that would dilute other holders to an "unacceptable level." It also said Mr. Marquez was "no longer in a position" to purchase the additional shares. "We also feel that if, at some time in the future, it is necessary to raise additional capital, we should be able to do so on more favorable terms than those provided in the terminated agreement," said Clinton Howard, president and chief operating officer, in a statement.
District Commissioner F. Joseph Donohue plugged for police and fire pay raises and higher unemployment payments last night on his weekly radio ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Report to the Peopleï¿½Û over Station WWDC.</br></br>Donohue said that if he has read news accounts correctly it was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½quite likelyï¿½Û his last broadcast as a Commissioner. A Democrat, he expects to be replaced at any moment by a Republican.</br></br>He said he hoped the new Commissioner would continue the 15-minute weekly discussions of District affairs so city residents may be kept ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½continuously informedï¿½Û of local government problems.</br></br>Donohue said police and fire pay raises, which he has been pushing during his two-year stay at the District Building, are absolutely essential to prevent loss of protection by resignations and a lack of recruits in both department?.</br></br>-But, he stated, according to present budget estimates a larger Federal pavment will be needed to meet the increase.
While the U.S. economy bounced back in the fourth quarter, Europe's own gross domestic product shrank for the first time since 1993, according to the chief European statistics agency. Still, evidence is mounting that a recovery on the Continent is under way.</br></br>Among the 12 countries that share the euro, GDP, the total value of goods and services, contracted by 0.2% in the fourth quarter from the third, Eurostat reported. Growth was dragged down by corporate retrenchment in the face of slackening global demand. But just as it followed the U.S. in its downturn, Europe appears to be moving upward now as well.</br></br>Surveys show that Europe's overall economic mood, as measured by the European Economic Sentiment Indicator, is now at its best since September, and inflation is on the whole falling. Spaniards are building. Italians are using more phone services and burning more electricity. The French keep buying. Lufthansa, the German airline, recently lifted a hiring freeze on cabin and ground crew as it prepares for more flights to the U.S. this summer. "Indicators increasingly point to improvements in economic conditions," Wim Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, said last week.</br></br>In its latest growth forecasts, the European Commission agreed. The European Union's executive body predicted yesterday that growth this quarter would be between 0.1% and 0.4%, from last quarter, and would improve further to 0.4% to 0.7% next quarter. "These forecasts confirm that the slowdown is over but suggest that the recovery will be moderate," the commission said in a statement.</br></br>There is a wrinkle. The budding European economy is also unfolding at different rates in different countries. That isn't unusual for a large region, but part of the problem stems from the euro zone's very reason for being: Europe's common currency regime, which limits how much laggard countries such as Germany can spend to jump-start their economies.
NEW YORK -- Just suppose the bond market rallied.</br></br>After a year of falling bond prices, few people are willing to make that bet. But if you are, analysts say, there's one investment you really ought to consider: leveraged municipal bond funds.</br></br>"If you want to make an aggressive bet on lower interest rates, those funds are the way to go," says Catherine Gillis, editor of Morningstar Closed-End Funds, a Chicago newsletter. "This is a trading play. This isn't for your mild-mannered municipal bond investor."</br></br>Not at all. Most people hold their muni investments for years. But anyone achieving a short-term profit in leveraged muni funds might be well advised to grab it and run.</br></br>To buy these high-octane investments, you have to enter an arcane corner of the stock market occupied by closed-end funds. A closed-end fund has a fixed number of shares outstanding, traded on an exchange. The shares often trade for less than the per-share value of the fund's portfolio, so you can effectively buy $1 of fund assets for just 90 or 95 cents.
Can Techs</br></br>Pick Up Slack</br></br>In Stock Market?</br></br>Big tech stocks are shooting up like bottle rockets, leading to oohs and ahhs on Wall Street.</br></br>Since early March, the Nasdaq 100 index, which tracks large technology stocks like Google and International Business Machines, is up 15%, compared with an 11% gain by the S&P 500.
Stephen Fuller has studied the habits of consumers and commuters for more than 40 years, and he has come to a conclusion: Emotion, more than reason, determines how much people value their time. They sit in massive traffic jams on their way to and from work each day, he believes, because they don't bother to calculate what their non- working time is worth.</br></br>Now Fuller, a public policy professor at George Mason University and director of the Center for Regional Analysis, has forced a small group of people to make that calculation. His survey of Fredericksburg area residents who work elsewhere -- an estimated 40 percent of the workforce -- was commissioned by an economic development group hoping to lure higher-paying businesses to the region, which relies heavily on retail and other low-skilled jobs.</br></br>The almost 1,500 commuters were asked: How much would you be willing to cut your salary in exchange for a shorter drive to work?</br></br>About 31 percent said they were willing to take an annual pay cut of $5,000 to $6,000 in exchange for a commute that was 30 minutes shorter each way. About 17 percent said they would forgo $10,000 a year for that extra daily hour.</br></br>"People generally think the commute is just part of the cost of living, like going to the dentist or raking leaves: It's just something you have to do," Fuller said. "They don't think about it until they're pressed. We try to get them to put some value on their time."
American Greetings is a Wall Street darling today, but can the romance endure?</br></br>For investors who favor long-term relationships, the answer is probably yes. For those more interested in quick flings, probably not.</br></br>The stock of the Cleveland-based greeting card maker is currently near its trading high of 37 1/2, reached last month, and the company expects sales to top $1 billion for the first time in the fiscal year beginning next Friday. That's pretty spectacular, considering that only three years ago the company's stock was trading at roughly one-fourth its current price (adjusted for a 2-for-1 stock split in February 1983) and sales were a tad over $600 million.</br></br>Therein lies the catch for short-term investors. Analysts say, and company executives readily concede, that the growth rate of the next three years is unlikely to match that of the past three. As growth slows, some analysts believe, the company's price-earnings ratio, now about 16, may also soften. Even some long-term holders contend the stock now is fully priced.</br></br>"We wouldn't be buying the stock today," says William J. Goldsborough, a vice president at Lincoln Capital Management Co., Chicago, which holds about 1.4 million American Greetings shares. But that doesn't mean that Mr. Goldsborough isn't a fan.
The More Parents Make,</br></br>The More Spent on Baby</br></br>THE TYPICAL BABY born to affluent parents in 1993 could cost as much as $334,600 to raise to the age of 18. And that doesn't include prenatal care, delivery costs or college.</br></br>That staggering sum is what may be spent by an average married couple with a pretax income of $54,100 or more, according to estimates by Mark Lino, an economist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's family economics research group. Couples with incomes of $32,000 to $54,100 may spend $231,100; those who make less could spend $170,900. The estimates assume an annual inflation rate of 6% and include both working and nonworking parents with a range of living expenses.</br></br>Single children are more expensive. For middle-income couples, the estimated expense of rearing an only child under the age of three was $8,700 last year. For those who had one child under three years old and a 16 year old, the estimated cost for the younger child was $6,900. For those with one young child and two others aged 13 and 16, a 22% economy of scale per child comes into play, making the youngest a comparative bargain at $5,400.
The nationï¿½Ûªs economic output dropped drastically in the first three months of 1974, the Commerce Department reported yesterday, but the inflation rate reached 10.8 per cent a year, the highest since the Korean War.</br></br>5.8	per cent from the last quarter of 1973 to the first quarter of this year, the most severe drop since 1958.</br></br>The remedy, the administration declared, is to try to curb inflation rather than stepping up consumer demand.</br></br>The consumer is now buying less only because inflation is rising faster than his earning power, Assistant Secretary of Commerce* Sidney L. Jones told a press conference.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I still think that we will have growth in the second half of the year ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but we are seeing a brutal effect of inflation,ï¿½Û Jones said.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>WASHINGTON -- There are signs that the long downward spiral of the U.S. manufacturing sector may have hit bottom.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported Friday that orders for durable goods, items meant to last three years or longer, rose a stronger- than-expected 2.1% in June, the largest gain in nearly a year. Shipments rose 1.3% in June and unfilled orders increased 0.1%. Orders for May, meanwhile, were revised upward to unchanged from a previously estimated decline of 0.4%.</br></br>While the improvement in orders is hardly enough to signal that manufacturing is out of the woods, it may suggest that the long- suffering industry could be poised for better times ahead. "I think manufacturing has turned the corner," said Ken Mayland, economist at ClearView Economics in Cleveland. Economists had expected durable- goods orders to show strong growth in June based on improvement in several regional manufacturing surveys. However, the size of the June gain was larger than most had anticipated.</br></br>David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch & Co., said the durable-goods report, when combined with other recent positive economic news, means that economic growth in the third quarter will show an improvement compared with the anemic second quarter. "The third quarter is looking good," he said. "Not great, but good."
RECOMMENDED READING</br></br>SINCE THE dawn of the digital era, parents have been wondering if videogames are good for their kids. Now the question is becoming ever more urgent as games evolve to look and sound scarily realistic.</br></br>To get a handle on the issue, we turned to Craig Anderson, a distinguished professor of psychology at Iowa State University and co- author of "Violent Video Game Effects on Children and Adolescents: Theory, Research, and Public Policy."</br></br>Here are some of Mr. Anderson's picks for resources about videogames and their effect on children -- and his comments on each.</br></br>-- Emily Meehan
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that he has "put some distance" between himself and other members of the White House stock market task force headed by Treasury Undersecretary George Gould.</br></br>David Ruder made the remarks in an interview after a hearing before the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, where the Republican SEC chairman at times found himself allied with House Democrats who were attacking the Reagan administration.</br></br>At the hearing, subcommittee chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) praised Ruder for supporting new market legislation-drafted in response to the Oct. 19 stock collapse-but criticized other members of the task force, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Wendy Lee Gramm, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</br></br>"I regretfully believe that history will judge your work product far more harshly than has your boss, President Reagan," Markey said. "For you have missed an historic opportunity to erect a dynamic, coherent and unified regulatory structure."</br></br>In a brief appearance near the hearing's conclusion, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) warned of the possibility of another stock market collapse. He instructed the regulators not "to come by my office" when the public goes after government officials "who sat idly by" instead of acting to restore investor confidence.

Your Aug. 24 editorial "Fannie Mug" presents an argument about the role Fannie Mae plays in mortgage finance that is plainly wrong. You also make a proposal for an alternative mortgage finance system that is just wrongheaded.</br></br>For more than 50 years, Fannie Mae has served every region of the country, at all times, in good housing markets and bad, bringing lower cost mortgage rates to Americans of modest means. The average annual saving to the homeowner whose loan we buy or securitize amounts to nearly $400. This year alone we will serve two million American families and add substantial liquidity to a mortgage market that will see an astounding $700 billion in new originations. We are the largest private investor in multifamily housing, and 18 months ago announced a commitment to purchase $10 billion in loans by the end of 1994, specifically targeted to low- and moderate-income families. Finally, largely because of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, there has been no credit crunch for home buyers throughout the recession.</br></br>Yet you propose scrapping the current smoothly functioning mortgage finance system of which we are a part. It would be replaced by one that would lead to higher mortgage rates and severe liquidity problems. Substituting Fannie Mae's role in mortgage finance with a purely private system may satisfy a theoretical and ideological goal. It would, however, deny consumers the advantages they now have, and subject them to a new system whose effectiveness has not yet been tested.</br></br>Consumers would no longer be served by companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are limited to one industry-housing finance. Instead, the market would be served by companies able to pick and choose whether, and at what price, to fund homeownership. The mugging mentioned in the title of your editorial would surely take place, and the home buyer would be the victim.</br></br>You implied that we receive a $4 billion federal subsidy. No fewer than five studies by the Office of Management and Budget, the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office have found that any governmental benefits we receive flow directly to consumers. The risk-based capital requirement in the pending "government-sponsored entities" legislation is, contrary to the editorial's assertion, far tougher than bank and thrift risk based standards. It requires us to capitalize against credit and interest rate conditions so severe that were those conditions to become real, they would amount to nothing short of economic catastrophe for the nation, not just Fannie Mae.
Virginia Electric and Power Co. has lost its race with the clock and will have to shut down its North Anna nuclear power plant before putting Surry Unit No. 1 back in operation, officials said.</br></br>Having both units down at once will leave the state without nucleargenerated electricity for the second time this- year, Vepco officials said.</br></br>The utility had hoped to have the Surry unit operating before the closing of North Anna set for Friday, a Vepco spokesman said.

Real-estate stocks took investors on a wild ride in 2009 and ended the year with strong gains. Don't count on so much excitement in 2010.</br></br>The Dow Jones Equity All REIT Total Return Index is up 31% this year, reversing a 38% decline in 2008. The most recent performance outpaced the 25% return posted by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and was the strongest performance since 2006.</br></br>"It's been very much a roller-coaster ride this year. And we're about to end this year on a high note," said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. "If you go back to the beginning of 2009, the market was staring into the abyss," he said, adding that sentiment began to change as the stock market rebounded, credit spreads tightened and the recapitalization wave began.</br></br>For real-estate investment trusts, or REITS, sentiment swung from dismal to ecstatic. Early in the year, many investors were reading the funeral rites for large numbers of REITs as credit dried up amid the recession. By March 9, the Dow Jones REIT index had tumbled 76% from its high in February 2007.</br></br>REITs survived by tapping the stock market and using the proceeds to pay down debt. Other cash-preserving measures included dividend cuts. Others paid dividends by using stock instead of cash. By year's end, only one large property-owning REIT, mall company General Growth Properties Inc., filed for bankruptcy protection.
WASHINGTON -- Culminating more than a year of effort by the U.S., Britain and scores of antipoverty activists, the governors of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund endorsed a plan to forgive as much as $55 billion in loans to as many as 40 impoverished nations.</br></br>The endorsements, during a series of weekend meetings here, make the debt-relief offer all but final. The executive boards of both institutions could meet as early as this week to seal the deal.</br></br>"To make growth achievable and future aid more likely to bolster success, we simply must confront unsustainable debt burdens in the poorest countries," Treasury Secretary John Snow told representatives of the other 183 IMF and World Bank member nations Saturday.</br></br>Entering the weekend, the debt-relief plan appeared in danger of stalling, though President Bush and his counterparts from the other Group of Eight major industrialized powers had signed off on it during a summit in Scotland in July.</br></br>The big breakthrough came Friday night, when Mr. Snow and his G-8 counterparts signed a letter pledging to replenish the World Bank's resources to make up for revenue lost when the bank forgives billions of dollars in loans outstanding. The pledge helped assuage the fears of the Netherlands and other small countries that big nations would demand that the World Bank -- the largest lender for developing nations -- forgive billions of dollars in loans, possibly leaving it short of cash for its development mission.
The chairman of the House Banking Committee yesterday called for a wholesale re-examination of the Carter Administrationï¿½Ûªs dollar-rescue program, charging that high interest rates being promoted by the Administration will actually weaken rather than strengthen the dollar next year.</br></br>And in terms of the depressive domestic impact of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½budget austerityï¿½Û now at the heart of Carterï¿½Ûªs announced economic policy. Rep. Henry S. Reuss (D-Wisc.) warned that it could lead to civil strife in financially stricken cities like Cleveland, Newark, and Detroit.</br></br>The Wisconsin Democrat will begin two days of hearings before a Joint Economic Committee subcommittee on these questions today, with Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumen-thal and Charles L. Schultze chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, as lead-off witnesses. Federal Reserve Chairman G. William Miller will testify on Friday. Academic and other witnesses will also be heard.</br></br>Reussï¿½Ûª major policy prescription is not a new one. He suggested in a statement released yesterday that the U.S. should rely less on massive intervention, and more on a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½substitution account" at the International Monetary Fund, through which dol-lar-holders could exchange unwanted money for ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½enlarged and re-christened special drawing rights.ï¿½Û</br></br>The ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½substitution accountï¿½Û idea has been popular among international monetary system reformers, going back to 1972. But it was put aside, when the IMF formally adopted floating exchange rates as the basis for the international monetary system.
Here's how some major bills fared recently in Congress and how local congressional members voted, as provided by Thomas's Roll Call Report Syndicate. NV means Not Voting.</br></br>The House approved a motion that had the effect of giving members of Congress a 2.7 percent pay increase, raising their salary to about $145,100 in January 2001.</br></br>Had opponents of the pay raise won this vote, they would have offered a motion to kill the automatic cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). They mounted this procedural attack after House leaders denied them debate and a direct, up- or-down vote on the merits of raising congressional pay. The vote occurred during debate on a Treasury Department funding bill for fiscal 2001 (HR 4871).</br></br>The House approved tax breaks to help individuals invest more of their earnings in Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans and other retirement vehicles. The bill (HR 1102) is projected to cost the Treasury $52.2 billion over 10 years.</br></br>It would raise the IRA contribution limit for individuals from $2,000 today to $3,000 in 2001, $4,000 in 2002 and $5,000 in 2003, and begin adjusting IRA contribution limits for inflation. For individuals older than 50, the new $5,000 limit would take effect as soon as the bill became law.
A continuing economic boom in the Washington area pushed the local unemployment rate down to 2.7 percent in April, leaving many employers searching desperately for help.</br></br>Unemployment in the District reached a 16-year low of 5.2 percent in April-the most recent data available-according to a report released yesterday by the District government.</br></br>The national jobless rate rose slightly last month to 5.6 percent, the Labor Department announced yesterday, but officials said the increase likely was a statistical quirk and may not indicate any significant slowdown in the nation's economy. {Details on Page B1.}</br></br>Fairfax County, buoyed by real estate development, retail growth and defense contracting, registered a 1.5 percent unemployment rate in April, the lowest county figure in Virginia. In Maryland counties within the metropolitan area, the rate was 3.1 percent in March, the most recent figure available for that area.</br></br>"If anyone wants a job right now, the job is there," said Dee Esser, supervisor of marketing for Virginia's Department of Economic Information Services, the agency that monitors employment trends. "The influx of new industry and new organizations and new retail and new services requires people that we just don't have right now," she said.
WASHINGTON -- Has the U.S. entered a new era of high long-term economic growth?</br></br>Given the economy's listless performance in the last half of 1984, that question might well seem irrelevant. But it is at the center of a fiery debate over the course of U.S. economic policy, a debate that is influencing federal budget and monetary decisions.</br></br>On the offense are the "five-percenters" -- a small but well-connected band of economists and politicians. They are convinced the economy has undergone fundamental changes during the Reagan administration and can achieve an extraordinary 5% growth rate over the next five years.</br></br>These optimists are led by Republican Rep. Jack Kemp of New York and a group of supply-side economists who fought vehemently for tax cuts in 1981. They expect those cuts to pay off in sharply improved economic performance. If they are right, tax revenues will be higher than now projected and the budget deficit problem will be less menacing.</br></br>On the defense are the "three-percenters" -- a less cheerful but far more numerous collection of economists. They see little reason to believe economic performance will be radically better than in the past.

When Cherie and Brian Lowe of suburban Indianapolis threw a party last spring, 150 well-wishers came bearing casseroles.</br></br>This was no birthday or anniversary bash. Mr. Lowe, a lawyer, and Ms. Lowe, a stay-at-home mom, both 36 years old, were celebrating an accomplishment: paying off $127,482.30 in debt, mainly student loans.</br></br>Partygoers came from as far as 200 miles away. Some had never met the Lowes but followed their quest through a blog called Queen of Free. Guests won prizes such as personal-finance books, museum passes and homemade cleaning supplies. One friend sang "Sallie Mae Is Not My Lender" to the tune of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean."</br></br>Americans are struggling with student loans like never before. Outstanding student-loan debt hit a record-high $956 billion in the third quarter, and 11% of student-loan balances were at least 90 days behind on payments, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</br></br>Some borrowers are fighting back, using a combination of extreme frugality and extra part-time jobs. And a few who win the battle by retiring their bills early are marking the triumph in style.
NEW YORK -- The dollar looks poised to weaken somewhat this week, as the market turns its attention to the last big batch of data ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting at the end of the month.</br></br>However, political events elsewhere could help the dollar, as Japan readies for its June 25 Lower House election and Europe grapples with economic reform. Analysts expect the dollar to trade in a range of 103 yen and 108 yen and near 96 cents against the euro.</br></br>Many European markets are closed today for a holiday.</br></br>Analysts expect more data indicating that the U.S. economy is slowing, which would feed speculation that the Fed will pass on raising interest rates at its June 27-28 meeting. "The key data are retail sales and consumer prices," said John Rothfield, senior currency strategist at Bank of America in San Francisco. "We expect those to be benign, and that will probably trigger a rally in some of the other currencies."</br></br>The producer-price index for May, announced Friday, was unchanged, suggesting that consumer prices also will be benign and leaving an uncertain outlook for U.S. interest rates.
NEW DELHI--India's government said Tuesday it will launch a stimulus package to boost trade after data showed exports in November fell from a year earlier--the seventh consecutive month of on-year decline.</br></br>The country's trade deficit narrowed to $19.3 billion in November from $21.0 billion in October, but it was up from the $15.8 billion reported a year earlier, and the government said it could fall short of its full-year export target.</br></br>Exports for the month fell 4.17% from a year earlier to $22.3 billion, while imports rose 6.35% to $41.5 billion.</br></br>Weak exports are worsening the slowdown in India, where the government faces intense domestic political pressure due to high inflation, a ballooning fiscal deficit and tight monetary policy. The economy grew 6.5% last fiscal year--the slowest pace in nearly a decade--and the rupee has weakened about 2.6% against the U.S. dollar so far in 2012, after a 16% fall in 2011.</br></br>Trade Secretary S.R. Rao said the government will announce by the end of this week a package to stimulate merchandise exports, which would help boost exports in the January-March quarter. He didn't give details of the package.
President Clinton yesterday nominated White House Budget Director Alice M. Rivlin and St. Louis economist Laurence H. Meyer to fill vacancies on the Federal Reserve Board. As expected, he also called for appointing Alan Greenspan to a third four-year term as Fed chairman.</br></br>Announcing the nominations from the Oval Office, Clinton hailed Rivlin as "one of our nation's foremost experts on how to keep the economy growing" and lauded Meyer for the accuracy of his economic forecasts.</br></br>The nominations mark the end of a long and tempestuous search for candidates for the Fed positions. Clinton earlier said he was seeking Fed appointees who would challenge the view held by many economists -- including Greenspan -- that allowing the economy to grow faster than about 2.2 percent annually would trigger a burst of price increases.</br></br>But economists and investors yesterday doubted that Rivlin -- nominated for the Fed's vice chairmanship -- or Meyer would push such a debate. Many analysts described the two nominees as careful, solidly mainstream figures whose views about the economy do not diverge significantly from the majority of the Greenspan-led board.</br></br>Rivlin is "very judicious," said Charles Schultze, President Jimmy Carter's top economist and for years a colleague of Rivlin's at the Brookings Institution before she joined the Clinton administration in 1993. "She's not going to leap before looking."
The U.S. government took modest action to slow the rise of the dollar. But officials indicated the move was largely symbolic and didn't reflect a commitment to stop further increases in the currency.</br></br>The U.S. intervention in currency markets occurred yesterday morning, when the Federal Reserve sold a small amount of dollars in exchange for West German marks. The move helped slow the rally that has carried the dollar sharply higher in the past week.</br></br>U.S. officials indicated that the Fed's action was intended as a show of support for the West German central bank, whose leaders fear further increases in the dollar could boost inflation in their country.</br></br>But U.S. officials remain generally satisfied with the recent rise in the dollar. At the Fed, in particular, it is seen as a sign that foreign investors are growing convinced of the central bank's determination to fight inflation. Fed officials have no intention, for now, of undertaking large-scale intervention to stop the dollar's ascent.</br></br>New York currency dealers described yesterday's intervention as modest. They said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York entered the market in the morning when the dollar was trading at a little above 1.8200 West German marks and sold several banks between $10 million and $15 million each. Traders estimated the Fed's total sales at between $200 million and $300 million, enough to move the market but not have a lasting impact.
NEW YORK, June 24 UPiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Oils were strong today in the stock market, but that was not enough to save the list from a moderate decline.</br></br>The small step backward came from record high levels achieved yesterday.

Most days, Maria Salientes works the gates and ramps for US Airways Express at Reagan National Airport. Today, she is sitting at home with her three children, out of work and unsure whether she can return to the only U.S. airport closed after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</br></br>Salientes, 29, is but one face of about 10,000 National Airport workers whose lives have been turned upside down by the Bush administration's decision to close indefinitely an airport that is an anchor of the region's economy.</br></br>About 45,000 people a day used National. Until federal officials determine whether to reopen it, workers such as Salientes are in turmoil, trying to figure out their next step.</br></br>US Airways Express, a network of 10 airlines that ferry US Airways passengers between hubs and cities, retains 150 people at National. Of those, 120 -- including Salientes -- are collecting unemployment.</br></br>"I want to get my employees back," said Salientes' boss, Daryush Mazhari, the US Airways Express station manager at National. "These were tragic incidents, and we understand. But you can't safeguard against everything all the time. The planes didn't come from National."
The money supply measure the Federal Reserve has been watching most closely for setting monetary policy rose at a 291 -ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½> percent annual rate in January, apparently largely because of a huge flow of funds into the new money market deposits ac- _ counts.</br></br>The Fedï¿½Ûªs policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided on Jan. 28 not to respond by tightening conditions in financial markets because a staff analysis said the enormous popularity of the money market deposit accounts was to blame.</br></br>Deposits in the new afccounts, which were first available Dec. 14, reached $232.2 billion in the week ended Feb. 2 as the closely watched money measure, M-2, rose $48.1 billion in January. Most of the funds in the new accounts came from other accounts and certificates of deposit already part of M-2. '</br></br>The FOMC also met this week for two days to decide upon money growth targets for 1983, which Fed Chairman Paul A. Volcker will disclose next Wednesday in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee.</br></br>Separately, the Fed announced that it has changed the definition of M-2 slightly and that it has revised figures for 1982 both for that reason and because of a recalculation of seasonal adjustment factors.
NEW YORK, Nov. 11 hpï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Aircrafts and rocket fuel stocks made some gains as the stock market edged ahead today in a slow Veterans Day session.</br></br>The turnover of 1,540.000 shares was the lightest since Oct. 4. With only 1057 issues traded, it was the narrowest market of the year.</br></br>The range of gains among key stocks was from fractions to a point, generally, but reached around 5 points in the aircraft division. There was a liberal scattering of fractional losers and Standard Oil (New Jersey) dropped more than 2 as trading began on rights to subscribe to its big new stock issue. The rights were traded briskly but ended the day at the same price as they opened.</br></br>Tlte aircrafts were helped by some good corporate news. United Aircraft declared a 20 per cent stock dividend and the stock rose 4;U to 62. Air Force officials said contracts will soon be concluded for about a billion dollars worth of Boeing B-52 and Convair (General Dynamics) B-58 bombers. Both stocks added a couple of points.</br></br>general tonic of news that the head of the United States satellite program proposed a new project aimed at sending a man into . space. The background was improved further by a report that the'Administration is ] seeking congressional approval for a temporary increase in the federal debt limit.
Stock prices ended mixed today as Wall Street waited for remarks this week by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the Senate Banking Committee.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 10.43 points at 3963.97. Declining issues slightly outnumbered advancing ones on the New York Stock Exchange; trading volume fell to 308.1 million shares from Friday's 347.98 million. Financial markets were closed Monday for Presidents' Day.</br></br>Broader market indicators also were mixed. The Nasdaq index ended down 2.35 points to 784.62 and the American Stock Exchange index was off 0.09 to 447.51. But the NYSE composite index edged up 0.15 to 261.98 and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.77 to 482.74.</br></br>Traders attributed the rally in blue-chip stocks to the reversal of some of Friday's options-related selling that wiped out 34 points from the Dow average.</br></br>Analysts said most investors saw few incentives to get involved ahead of congressional testimony on Wednesday by Greenspan. Traders will be looking for hints on the direction of the Fed's monetary policy.
an easy credit policy. But it is not quite so easy as it .was. The difference may presage a rise in interest rates later in the year.</br></br>How far the federal reserve plans to go remains to be seen. It seems highly unlikely that the nationï¿½Ûªs central bank will get downright stingy with credit. Yet, official figures strongly indicate that it is becoming a little less generous.</br></br>Officials at the board followed their customary practice today of declining to explain subtle shifts in policy and emphasis. But they openly declined to dispute the inference that the boardï¿½Ûªs own figures on bank reserves point to a shading in the direction of less credit.</br></br>As yet, the shift in emphasis has produced no noticeable upward trend in interest rates The boardï¿½Ûªs own discount rate still is 3 per cent. Banks still have ample supplies of loan money. There is said to be an excess of mortgage money.</br></br>Federal Reserve officials feel there is no foreseeable danger that modifying credit ease will hinder economic expansion.
NEW YORK. Nov. 18 (AP>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wall street hopes of a negotiated steel settlement swept the stock market higher on a broad front today for its best rise since Oct. 23. The firm tone underlying the market was a much more convincing end to the recent string of declines than yesterday's slight gain.</br></br>Gains in steels ran to around 3 points and more. Advances by steel-starved automobile builders were as high as 2 points and rails showed frequent gains of better than a point on hopes of increased carloading*.</br></br>Broker sentiment looking toward steel peace was based in part on a report by Iron Age Magazine that any voluntary agreement between industry and union negotiators would be a non-inflationary three-year pact. It also was pointed out that both steels and rails were entitled to a technical recovery after recent slumps.</br></br>The AP 60-stock average rose $2.30 to S221.20 with industrials up S3.10. rails up S3 and utilities up 50 cents. The average also gained S2.30 on Oct. 23.</br></br>Tube spurted 5*4 to 125*4 and Jones & Laughlin rose 3V* to 74H. Ford and Chrysler both were up 21* among motors, while rails were led by Baltimore & Ohio, up 1%, the Pennsylvania, up 11* and New York Central, up 1. The Pennsy was aided by a published prediction the nation's largest road would declare a dividend Thursday, thereby preserving its tradition of an annual payment for the past 111 years.
Since peaking in the second term of Ronald Reagan's presidency, spending on weapons by the Pentagon has been on a steady decline. In real terms, adjusted for inflation, spending on production of planes, ships, tanks and ammunition has fallen 70 percent since 1985.</br></br>This year, though, the Clinton administration is trying to reverse that slide, asking Congress in the president's recently released budget for the first real increase in defense procurement in 13 years. As the chart at the right shows, this reversal comes as the overall defense budget -- which includes spending for operations, maintenance and personnel in addition to weaponry -- is barely rising. When adjusted for inflation, it actually shows a 1 percent decline.</br></br>"It's certainly fair to say the deep cuts in procurement over the past 10 years are over," said Steven M. Kosiak, budget analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments in Washington.</br></br>President Clinton's budget seeks $48.7 billion for new weaponry in fiscal 1999, up nearly 9 percent from $44.8 billion in the current year's budget. By 2000, the plan calls for $54.1 billion in procurement spending, and the number rises to $63.5 billion by 2003.</br></br>The spending shift can be attributed to the need to modernize many of the military's older weapons as well as the administration's desire to begin production of some 21st-century programs.
WASHINGTON -- Christmas may not be as merry as some retailers hoped.</br></br>As the economy slowed in several parts of the country, retail sales in the past six weeks were weaker than retailers expected, according to the Federal Reserve's latest survey of regional economic conditions.</br></br>There were some bright spots: Discount department stores showed strong growth in sales. And on the day after Thanksgiving, regarded as the biggest shopping day of the year, sales rose modestly from a year earlier. But in the Boston area, for example, most retailers reported that sales were "clearly slowing," the report said. And "Christmas has started slowly" in and around San Francisco, where sales were mixed. In the Atlanta district, sales were flat.</br></br>Some retailers were concerned that consumers may pull back during the holiday season, the report said. But others are counting on more traditional weather conditions to arrive and drive shoppers from the parks back into the malls.</br></br>Retailers also said the tight labor market is making it difficult to recruit and maintain qualified workers for the holiday rush. Some retailers in the Cleveland district said they are paying seasonal employees as much as 25% more than last year.
MUMBAI -- ICICI Bank Ltd., India's largest private sector lender by assets, Thursday said it will launch two new home loan products with interest rates fixed for one and two years--a reminder of the teaser loan schemes which became a banking sector trend in 2009-2010.</br></br>"Fixed interest rates will shield customers from frequent changes in home loan interest rates," the bank said.</br></br>Most lenders, after the 2008 Lehman crisis, had come out with loans at cheaper fixed rates to stimulate consumer demand as global conditions slowed growth in Asia's third-largest economy.</br></br>But, as growth picked up pace and interest rates moved higher, the central bank raised provisioning rules on such loans, leading the lenders to discontinue these schemes.</br></br>ICICI Bank will offer loans at interest rates of 10.50%-11.50% for a fixed one-year tenure.
NEW YORK, Dec. 9 VPiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Selling in steels led the way for todayï¿½Ûªs declining stock market but aircrafts and selected issues ï¿½Û¢ provided a minority of gainers.</br></br>The argument for a lower market, however, prevailed by about 2-to-l there being 652 losers to 327 gainers. The 1202 issues traded made it a broader-than-usual market.</br></br>Rails sagged to a new 1957 low. Motors, oils, chemicals, nonferrous metals and most rubbers were on the downside. It was a fairly selective market with a number of special situations bucking the trend. Some key stocks were off 2 or 3 points.</br></br>Steels were depressed not only by industry reports forecasting the sharpest output cuts since 1954 but also by the latest industry operating rate, scheduled at under 70 per cent of rated capacity and the lowest of the year.</br></br>Aircrafts were boosted by demands for bigger spending and more intensive effort following last weekï¿½Ûªs failure of the Vanguard satellite project and also by prospects of a number of new missile tests this week.
NEW YORK, Sept. 24 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market transformed itself today from a mildly declining list to one making a ragged and turbulent uDsuree in heavy trading.</br></br>The Dow-Jones industrial average, which was down 3.89 at the end of the first hour, ended with a net gain of 2.09 at 929.54.</br></br>At the start, the market seemed to be taking a well-earned rest following the boisterous Thursday session which climaxed the sharp rise since Labor Day. It looked like a typical case of preweekend caution enhanced by the fact that Jewish holidays will be observed next week and this usually dampens the market.</br></br>Prominent in the rally were color television makers, other electronics, airlines, some rails and many selected issues. Steels, drugs and electrical equipments were generally higher.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks rose 1.1 to 343.2 with industrials up 1.0, rails up 2.1 and utilities off .5.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will estimate this week that the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1991 will be $138 billion, congressional sources said.</br></br>The figure is substantially higher than the roughly $100 billion deficit projected by the Bush administration, the sources said. Both estimates are far higher than the $64 billion deficit target for fiscal 1991 set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. That law requires that enough spending cuts and revenue-raising measures be taken to achieve a $64 billion deficit in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.</br></br>The CBO estimates provide fresh evidence that the nonpartisan congressional agency is far less optimistic about the budget outlook than is the president's Office of Management and Budget. The estimates are based on projections that assume current spending and tax policies do not change.</br></br>While the CBO figures are sure to be cited by administration critics who think that the OMB projections are too rosy, their practical impact on the budget process is limited.</br></br>The congressional agency plays only an advisory role in determining whether the deficit targets set by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings have been breached. By law, it is the OMB estimates that are used at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether spending must be cut across the board to meet the law's requirements.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it has fully recouped more than $70 billion in loans it made to support the 2008 bailouts of Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc., closing a contentious chapter in the central bank's history.</br></br>On Thursday, the regional Federal Reserve bank said it has been repaid, with interest, on $53.1 billion in loans it made to two crisis-era vehicles that held complex subprime mortgage bonds, home loans, commercial-property loans and other unwanted assets from Bear and AIG. The New York Fed earlier recouped a separate $19.5 billion loan that financed the purchase of mortgage-backed securities from AIG.</br></br>The loan repayments, which followed sales of the formerly toxic assets, end a messy episode in the government's crisis-era rescue programs, which saw the New York Fed take many souring loans and bonds onto its balance sheet when financial markets were in free fall. The moves were criticized for exposing taxpayers to undue risks when many of the assets fell in value for months after they were acquired by the Fed.</br></br>Fed officials defended their crisis lending at the time, saying the central bank makes loans only when it expects to be fully repaid. Officials said they had to take steps to save the financial system from a collapse that threatened the economy's health. On Thursday, New York Fed President William Dudley called the loan repayments a "major milestone" for the bank and the public.</br></br>During the financial crisis, the Fed's balance sheet more than doubled in size to over $2 trillion as it made loans to help stabilize many parts of the nation's debt markets, including those for short-term commercial-paper markets and securities backed by auto loans, credit-card debt and small-business loans. The troubled assets from the Bear and AIG bailouts, held in vehicles called Maiden Lane, were the New York Fed's riskiest holdings.
The Internet continues to claim victims, the latest being Steve Case of AOL and Sony Music's Tommy Mottola.</br></br>Executives get bounced all the time for leading their companies and shareholders into disastrous deals. Mr. Case is getting bounced for cutting too good a deal for shareholders of the former AOL. His Time Warner colleagues can't forgive themselves for buying at the top of the Internet bubble, a regret for which there is no cure.</br></br>Let it be recalled, though, that like a lot of bubble misanthropes, Time Warner's board and executives went into the deal with eyes open. Gerald Levin, then CEO, remarked at the press conference that he accepted "the market capitalizations in the Internet space" as something "profound." Whether they were profound or not, they certainly proved short-lived, the Nasdaq beginning its dive a few weeks later.</br></br>Last week was an opportune moment for Mr. Case to beat a retreat. AOL's new "turnaround" plan is so screwed up by internal Time Warner compromises that it seems doomed to fail. He wasn't doing anybody any good by sticking around and putting his imprimatur on it.</br></br>Only by exploiting preferred carriage on Time Warner's own cable systems could AOL Broadband hope to achieve enough critical mass to demonstrate to other cable and DSL providers that AOL could help them generate better revenues than they could on their own. But this would mean cannibalizing Time Warner's pre-existing Road Runner broadband service, something the Time Warnerites evidently were unwilling to do.
Author: Peter D. Schiff</br></br>Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders "underwater." As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</br></br>Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the "robo-signing"-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a "double dip" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</br></br>Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</br></br>By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit.
Like many real estate company executives, James J. Wilson, president and chief executive of Interstate General Co. L.P. in St. Charles, Md., worries about interest rates and federal policies that affect consumer demand for the homes his company builds and the lots it sells.</br></br>Wilson fretted so much about the federal budget deficit last year that he voted for Ross Perot, he said, even though he didn't want the Texan to win. "You have to know what's going on at all levels [of government]. It's going to come back and affect you," Wilson said.</br></br>He almost learned that lesson the hard way. Since going public in February 1987, the company Wilson founded in 1957 had posted a healthy string of profits until the fourth quarter of 1990, when it lost $473,000.</br></br>The last two years were difficult. The worst came in the second quarter of 1992, when the company lost $16.2 million. Interstate General would have filed for bankruptcy, like many other developers, except for its racetrack and off-track-betting operation in Puerto Rico, and the revenue it made on the 8,000 apartment units it owns, Wilson said.</br></br>Total revenue also declined, from a high of $64.4 million in 1990 to $41 million last year. Now, as quarterly profits are returning to the black ($2.3 million in the first quarter of the year), Wilson said he has decided to shift Interstate General's focus from home building and land development because they are so dependent on government actions.

In November 1998, more than 75 percent of Arlington County voters approved $4 million in bond money to renovate or replace the aging Westover Branch Library.</br></br>As is customary in a county known for communicating with residents, officials appointed a citizen committee, and plans emerged for an elaborate building. The building, a joint project with Arlington schools, would feature a library on the first floor, school offices on the second and an underground parking garage.</br></br>Yet more than five years later, there is no new library, even though the county has already spent $450,000 in design funds. And with the project behind schedule and at least several million dollars over budget, Arlington school officials recently notified the county they were pulling out of the project because they couldn't justify the expense. That has left county officials scrambling to redesign a scaled-down building and stay on a construction schedule that is not even supposed to start until next spring.</br></br>The best-case scenario: a new library sometime in fall 2006 -- a full eight years after voters first went to the polls to approve money for the facility.</br></br>"They have already spent $450,000 on a building they have now figured out they can't afford to build. They might not be quite at square zero, but they are close," said Wayne Kubicki, a member of the county's Fiscal Affairs Advisory Commission who has been tracking the project.
The much-anticipated second-half rebound in economic activity shows signs of materializing.</br></br>Some key real-time economic indicators improved during the early weeks of July.</br></br>Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said yesterday that sales in July are tracking at the high end of management's expectations. The company is expecting that stores open at least one year will report a 2% to 4% monthly increase in sales from a year earlier. The company said it is making up for weaker seasonal sales recorded in May and June. The Northeast is especially strong.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Economic Cycle Research Institute, a private research institute, said its weekly index of leading economic indicators climbed in mid-July to its highest level since early April 2000. The index -- which tracks a range of financial and economic indicators -- is growing at its fastest rate since 1987.</br></br>"The window of [economic] vulnerability that the index picked up earlier in the year has slammed shut," said Lakshman Achuthan, the group's managing director.
The presidentï¿½Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers told Congress yesterday it expects a surge in consumer buying, housing construction and defense spending to boost the economy out of recession this spring.</br></br>The CEA, in its annual report, said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1982 and 1983 should become the first of several years of prosperous growth and declining inflation occurring simultaneously.ï¿½Û But that will happen only if the Federal Reserve continues to restrain money growth and the public lowers its expectations of future inflation so that interest rates come down, the council said.</br></br>CEA Chairman Murray L. Wei-denbaum said the Fedï¿½Ûªs money growth target for 1982 is consistent with the administrationï¿½Ûªs forecast.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The principal areas that are anticipated to lead the expansion next year are business investment, inventories . . . and a further acceleration in defense deliveries,ï¿½Û the council said.</br></br>Unemployment, which was 8.8 percent in December and 8.5 percent last month, "is expected to reach the vicinity of 9 percent this springï¿½Û and begin falling by between one-quarter and one-half of a percentage point each three months thereafter.
Republican Fairfax Supervisor Thomas M. Davis III has raised more than twice as much money as Democratic County Board Chairman Audrey Moore, but has little left in the bank as their campaign for Northern Virginia's most visible local office swings into its final month.</br></br>According to campaign finance reports filed yesterday, Davis collected $65,768 during September, bringing his total to $350,449, while Moore pulled in $39,388 during the same period, for a total of $156,650.</br></br>By spending less on consultants, pollsters and other campaign tools, Moore has squirreled away $47,355, while Davis has just $8,317 on hand.</br></br>The high-profile chairman's race has dwarfed every other contest in Northern Virginia in terms of big-bucks fund-raising. But it remains uncertain whether the two campaigns will be able to match the record-setting $1 million spending of the watershed 1987 election that swept Moore into office.</br></br>Strategists in both camps insisted they will raise what they need to win, but with just five weeks until the Nov. 5 election, ensuring money for television advertising has become a critical focus for Moore and Davis. "It's out there," said Davis campaign manager John Hishta. "It's difficult to get, but we're pursuing it as hard as we can."
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. -- At the 11th hour, as sleep-short United Nations delegates struggled toward agreement on an approach to Africa's economic crisis Sunday, Algeria rolled a political hand grenade into the meeting hall.</br></br>The Algerians tried to reintroduce the cause of the Polisario guerrillas, who are fighting to create their own nation in North Africa. A similar move had provoked an April walkout by the chief U.S. delegate at the negotiations, Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed. A new American exit, as the Algerians well knew, would have forced the General Assembly session on Africa to end in failure.</br></br>Often in the past, diplomats from developing nations have found it impossible not to support each other's pet political causes. But this time was different. From its planning stages last year, the African nations had been steadfast in their quest for their main goal, an economic-recovery program for their continent.</br></br>It took Senegal's foreign minister, Ibrahima Fall, all of 15 seconds, one delegate remembers, to adopt tactics to quash the Algerian maneuver. The Polisario cause stayed on the sidelines. The U.S. didn't walk out. A final document was drafted.</br></br>If that moment of crisis demonstrated the African nations' determination not to be distracted from their objective by politics, the other cliffhanger as the session came to an end displayed their new-found moderation.
Let's stop celebrating Labor Day -- by which I mean, let's stop assuming that the hard-won gains of organized labor in the United States are a done deal. And let's start using Labor Day to rededicate ourselves to the victories labor must win if it is to help working families in the 21st century.</br></br>In some ways, the end of this century resembles the end of the last one. Corporations have regained the kind of unfair advantages over working people that they have not enjoyed for nearly 100 years. And with this, we find many of the darker impulses of the Gilded Age alive and well among today's entrepreneurs -- specifically, the willingness to roll over working people who seem powerless.</br></br>In the 1990s, Americans are working harder than ever -- and they've got the stress to show for it. Millions now know what it's like to work uncompensated overtime in understaffed offices, or to work two jobs or to go without vacations and health insurance. For all this extra productivity that's been squeezed out of them in today's "lean and mean" workplace, the average American worker today earns less, works longer hours and spends less time with family.</br></br>Workers kept their side of the bargain in making America more competitive again, but the gains they won were not equally shared. And this inequality is going to continue until workers become as organized as they did in the labor movement's prime.</br></br>About 16 million American workers are represented by unions today. That's down 24.5 percent since 1980, at a time when our work force (approaching 137 million) is at an all-time high. Some say the reason is that manufacturing jobs have gone overseas. But the United States has more manufacturing jobs today than ever before -- the jobs just have moved south and west, to states where workers are not organized. Labor can't win better pay and benefits for members when employers down the street require unorganized workers to do the same work for lower wages and fewer benefits.
Every April 15 we ask: What is the government doing with my tax dollars?</br></br>We know how much Congress spends, but to what end? The Department of Education received $67 billion in 2004, but do children read better? The government spends $30 billion on agriculture annually. Most of these subsidies go to the wealthiest farmers, including Ted Turner, making it our largest corporate welfare program. Was this the intent?</br></br>Since 1993, the Government Performance and Results Act has required agencies to submit an annual performance report of goals and progress -- not unlike what shareholders expect from publicly traded companies -- an accounting of the agency's activities and financial condition. In spite of this law, some agencies still lag in transparently reporting on their goals and activities. According to the FY 2004 Annual Scorecard of agency performance reports (produced by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University), only 11% of the budget is covered by good reporting: The biggest agencies are still trying to articulate their goals and show public benefits, i.e. they don't know what results our dollars are delivering.</br></br>We are all shareholders in the largest fiscal entity in the U.S.: the federal government. This year's proposed budget equals $2.57 trillion, a figure likely to increase when the final budget passes Congress. The majority, 55%, goes to entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare. Discretionary activity consumes 37%, split evenly between defense and non-defense activities. The remaining 8% pays for interest on debt. Spending on entitlement programs will keep rising as baby boomers retire. And discretionary spending is also likely to creep ever higher. Without a change in budgetary behavior, spending as a share of GDP will rise to 40% by 2040. According to Comptroller General David Walker, balancing the budget in that year will require cutting spending by 60% or raising taxes to two-and-a- half times today's level.</br></br>Before imagining the horror of that tax bill, or the political fallout of slashing swaths of federal programs, such measures may be unnecessary if the government starts allocating money according to program effectiveness, not political calculation. It's common sense (but not general practice in Congress) that the government should only spend money on activities that show results. This concept, also known as "performance budgeting," has made inroads notably in President Bush's Management Agenda.
THE BIRTHDAY of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. is a national holiday because he spoke to all Americans, by word and example, about what it meant to be an American. Dr. King's message, finally, was not about race but justice, not about power but love.</br></br>Since Dr. King's death, the word love has not been much invoked in our political discourse, about race or anything else. It strikes the ear of 1993 as naive, a word that can't teach us much about either the causes or remedies of injustice. Politics is dominated by the language of power, social policy by numbers or ideology. Talk about race is accented by mistrust, anger and despair.</br></br>Dr. King understood all this, but fought it throughout his life. A preacher of the Gospel, he understood that his task was not simply to organize his friends but to convert his enemies. "The best way to assure oneself that love is disinterested," he said, "is to have love for the enemy neighbor from whom you expect no good in return, but only hostility and persecution."</br></br>In other hands, this might seem a recipe for resignation. On the contrary, Dr. King argued, only the strong could love. In his hands, love became a revolutionary concept that called into question the arrangements people accept on a day-to-day basis as "normal." "The hardhearted individual never sees people as people, but rather as mere objects or as impersonal cogs in an ever-turning wheel," he said in a sermon reprinted in his book "The Strength to Love." "In the vast wheel of industry, he sees men as hands. In the massive wheel of big city life, he sees men as digits in a multitude. In the deadly wheel of army life, he sees men as numbers in a regiment. He depersonalizes life."</br></br>With love as a prism, Dr. King saw his way to a devastating critique of racial oppression in this country - but also to a solution. He demonized no one, lost hope in no one. His immediate cause was civil rights for African Americans, but his goal was an America that lived up to its promises - promises he revered. His was "a dream deeply rooted in the American dream, that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal."
Stock prices have remained lofty throughout the recession on the hope that the economy would soon be getting better. It didnï¿½Ûªt hurt, of course, that millions of Americans pinched by lowier yields on their savings were for<5ed to seek shelter in the stock market.</br></br>But. can the stock market survive another downturn in the economy? And what should investors be doing if they think the answer is no? tt's' first hear the view of two of Streetï¿½Ûªs sawiest market observ-ers--economist Henry Kaufman and Paiil Guenther, president of Paine-Webberlnc.</br></br>Kfflfman is afraid of the stock market; and worried how it will affect Americansï¿½Ûª spending whenï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not ifï¿½ï¿½ï¿½it falls, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t donï¿½Ûªt think households fully appreciate what they are getting into," he said in a recent interview.</br></br>Guenther takes a more traditional Wail Street view. Where, he recently wondered, are small investors going to put; their money if not in the stock market? In other words, good economy) or not, Guenther is betting that stock prices can stay up.</br></br>The economy has slowed from last yearï¿½Ûªs pace. It might technically be heading back into a recession, although even pessimists expect it to eke out annual growth of at least 1 percent this quarter. Some people think the recession never really ended.
NEW YORK -- Business in the second quarter is expected to maintain the recent trend of ebbing sales, stable prices and marginal profit gains, according to a new Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey.</br></br>D&B's quarterly survey of business expectations indicates that "inflation isn't accelerating," said Joseph W. Duncan, corporate economist and chief statistician. And, he noted, "while sales optimism is at the lowest level since 1983, it remains well above the levels generally associated with impending recessions."</br></br>In the survey, conducted between Feb. 7 and Feb. 27, D&B asked 1,500 executives in manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing whether they expect increases, decreases or no change from their first-quarter sales, profits, prices, inventories, employment and new orders. The index in each case is the difference between those expecting an increase and those expecting a decrease.</br></br>While the sales outlook among manufacturers deteriorated, retailers expect higher sales in the second quarter, "underscoring the fact that consumers are now responsible for most of the current economic growth," Mr. Duncan said. The retailers' sales optimism index rose to 61 from 55 in the first quarter and 1989 fourth quarter.</br></br>He said sales optimism is strongest in the oil patch states of the West South Central region, while New England has the bleakest sales outlook. And virtually no employment growth is expected in New England in the next few months.
ADD SUGAR. That's the figurative advice real-estate brokers and investment advisers are dispensing to their clients, both buyers and sellers. With interest rates rising, some lenders tightening their standards for borrowers and prices for good-quality assets expected to remain high, experts say real-estate investors will need to sweeten the pot to close the gap between what sellers ask for and what buyers can afford.</br></br>Some techniques being recommended are designed to keep the buyer's down payment low. Others allow buyers and sellers to work out a way for buyers to afford a property as higher rates make conventional loans more costly. While these methods aren't new, they are being recommended more forcefully these days.</br></br>"We're going into a period where money won't be as easy to get. . . . Interest rates and mortgage rates ticking up is going to make financing a little tighter," says Jim Lumley, a Realtor in Amherst, Mass. "That means sometimes the sellers will have to be more flexible than they have in the past. Some of these techniques really speak to those sellers' flexibility."</br></br>Here are some of the techniques and how they work. They aren't guaranteed and sometimes can be risky for the buyer as well as the seller. In fact, sellers could end up back at the drawing board if these techniques collapse -- with properties on their hands to sell.</br></br>-- Rent Assignment. The buyer promises the seller the first month's or a few months' rent from the property instead of pocketing it himself. That money can then be put toward a down payment. Timour Shafran, managing director of Capin & Associates Inc., a New York- based real-estate brokerage firm, says buyers attempting this method better be sure to have enough money after assigning the rent to cover expenses, including debt service, if there is a mortgage on the property.
Author: Sharon Terlep,Randall Smith; Aaron Lucchetti</br></br>General Motors Co. said Wednesday that it will increase the size of its initial public offering by about 30% to 478 million shares, which could make it the largest global IPO in history.</br></br>The move, which came despite broad stock market losses Tuesday, is a response to stronger-than-expected demand for shares in the auto maker, which is generating solid profits after last year's U.S. government-orchestrated bankruptcy.</br></br>Earlier Tuesday, GM confirmed it would raise the expected price for shares sold in its IPO to a range of $32 to $33 from the previous $26 to $29. GM also plans to sell up to $4.6 billion of preferred stock, up from $3 billion previously planned. The IPO will be priced Wednesday after the U.S. stock markets close and the shares will start trading Thursday.</br></br>The value of the offering, including the mandatory convertible preferred shares, could reach $22.8 billion, eclipsing the $22.1 billion IPO by Agriculture Bank of China in July 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.
OTTAWA -- Bank of Canada Governor John Crow is using his own "made-in-Canada" policy to deal with inflation: He wants none of it regardless of what happens south of the border.</br></br>So when the U.S. prime rate fell last week, it was no surprise that the Canadian rate remained at a lofty 13.5% to keep inflation at bay.</br></br>"There is no God-given reason or law why we have to have inflation," says Mr. Crow, an extremely guarded man who watches his words closely even for a central banker. "I believe the underlying objective of monetary policy should be to provide currency that Canadians can have full confidence in. That means preserving the value of money. That means price stability. That means zero inflation."</br></br>That also means conflict. Mr. Crow's uncompromising stand against inflation has pushed real Canadian interest rates to near record highs, bringing the central banker into conflict with politicians, economists, businessmen and almost everyone who owes money and must pay interest.</br></br>Zero inflation "isn't an achievable goal," argues Don Blenkarn, chairman of the House of Commons finance committee. Trying to reach it would impose "horrendous" costs on the economy by stifling investment and expansion.
The nationï¿½Ûªs civilian unemployment rate, continuing to astound economists, plunged from 7.5 percent to 7.1 percent in June, the lowest rate in more than four years, thie Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Unemployment fell for the first time below the rate inherited by the Reagan administrationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½7.5 percent in January 1981ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½as 460,000 more Americans found work in June. The rate peaked during the last recession at 10.7 percent in December 1982. Since then the economy has added 6.7 million jobs.</br></br>Job gains have been greatest for adult men during the recovery, the Labor Department said, but last month the jobless rate for black teen-agers fell a surprising 10 percentage points, from 44.1 percent toi 34.3 percent.</br></br>President Reagan, who is expected to make the strong economic rebound a cornerstone of his reelection campaign, told the Texas Bar Association convention in San Antonio yesterday: "It is the first sin-glle administration for more than 20 years that has reduced inflation and unemployment at the same time."</br></br>According to economist Donald Straszheim of Wharton Econometrics, both measures havenï¿½Ûªt declined together from the beginning off a presidential term to its end simce the Kennedy administration. The civilian unemployment rate dropped from 6.6 percent in January 1961 to 4.9 percent in 1965, and inflation measured by the consumer price index declined from 1.6 percent to 1.1 percent during the same period.
While Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan was urging Congress to repeal the Depression-era law that separates banking and securities activities, two senators went a step further yesterday and introduced legislation calling for total deregulation of financial services.</br></br>But critics said the proposal by Sens. Alfonse Dï¿½ÛªAmato (R-N.Y.) and Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) was so radical that it could prevent Congress from agreeing on any legislation to loosen the reins on banking. The D'A-mato-Cranston bill would allow banks to be affiliated with securities, real estate, insurance and manufacturing companies as long as deposits insured with federal funds were not used to finance those other companies.</br></br>A competing bill, introduced last month by Sens. William Proxmire (D-Wis.) and Jake Garn (R-Utah), would repeal only the 54-year-old Glass-Steagall bill, which bars most commercial banks from the riskiest activities involved in issuing, buying and selling stocks and bonds.</br></br>That bill would continue to keep banks out of most real estate and insurance activities and to prevent manufacturers and other nonfinan-cial companies from owning banks.</br></br>Greenspan told a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that total deregulation should be considered only after Congress can
Uncertainty about interest rates and economic growth, ahead of a long holiday weekend, pushed stocks to some of their sharpest declines this year.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 235.23, or 2.20%, to 10466.93, the year's heaviest drop in point terms and thirdheaviest in percentage terms. Leading the way down were the old-style manufacturing stocks that had soared in April, as well as the banking stocks.</br></br>Even considering that point moves in the industrial average aren't as significant, in percentage terms, as when the index was at lower levels in past years, this has been a volatile week. There have been three drops of more than 100 points, including yesterday, and one gain (Wednesday's 171.07-point rally).</br></br>Some investors were locking in profits yesterday by selling winners ahead of what is expected to be quiet pre-MemorialDay trading today. International Business Machines, which had soared on Wednesday in advance of a stock split, declined. But Nasdaq-listed semiconductor stocks such as Intel posted gains, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell just 8.03, or 0.33%, to 2419.15. News that the Nasdaq Stock Market plans to extend trading into the evening hours helped buoy that index.</br></br>Investors continued to worry about last week's announcement from the Federal Reserve that it is leaning toward raising interest rates. A variety of analysts warned that a Fed move could come as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for June 29 and 30. Bonds fell on those concerns and on reports that foreign central banks were selling U.S. bonds. The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond declined 20/32, or $6.25 for every $1,000 in bond face value. That pushed the yield, which moves inversely to bond prices, up to 5.842%.
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--New applications for unemployment benefits stayed nearly unchanged from last week, showing that the labor market's recent improvement may be slowing.</br></br>Initial jobless claims decreased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 388,000 in the week ended April 21, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires predicted that 376,000 new claims would be filed last week.</br></br>It was the third straight week the level topped 385,000 -- claims haven't stayed that consistently high since November.</br></br>The prior week's level of claims was revised up to 389,000 from a previously reported 386,000.</br></br>The four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, increased by 6,250 to 381,750, the highest reading since the first week of the year.
NEW YORK -- Microsoft's strong profit stirred enthusiasm for technology stocks.</br></br>Microsoft (Nasdaq) jumped 5 15/16 to 92 1/4 after the software company issued fiscal first-quarter earnings late Tuesday that topped analysts' forecasts. Salomon Smith Barney, praising what it called a "pristine" profit statement, bumped up its fiscal 2000 profit estimate for the company.</br></br>"They played off those Microsoft numbers from the opening bell, and we've seen some good follow-through in the technology sector," said John Manahan, head of trading at Brown Brothers Harriman.</br></br>Gateway rose 5 1/8 to 52, Hewlett-Packard gained 2 13/16 to 76 9/16, and Apple Computer climbed 6 5/8 to 75 1/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Even Dell Computer moved higher, gaining 1 1/2 to 40 on Nasdaq. Dell had stirred some profit worries for the technology sector when it warned earlier this week its results would be hurt by rising prices for memory products.</br></br>Strong profit performances from other technology issues contributed to the optimism evident in the session. Computer Associates gained 3 3/4 to 58 1/4 after its fiscal second-quarter profit, released late Tuesday, proved a penny a share better than analysts anticipated.

Edwards, professor of finance at Indiana University.</br></br>Writing in the current issue of the newsletter distributed by MGIC Investment Corp., Edwards concludes that the Fed in its report had laid the blame for housing fluctuations at other doors, primarily inflation and fiscal policies, and accepts none of the blame for these fluctuations because of monetary policies.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The idea that the Federal Reserve can do no wrong seems to be deeply implanted in the System,ï¿½Û Edwards writes.

Gold prices posted the biggest daily gain in nine months on Thursday, driven by investors who were caught flat-footed by the Federal Reserve's outlook for continued low interest rates.</br></br>Gold for August delivery, the most actively traded contract, rose 3.3%, the biggest one-day percentage gain since September 2013. The contract rose $41.40 to $1,314.10 a troy ounce, its highest level since April 14.</br></br>Meanwhile, silver for July delivery gained 4.4% to $20.648 an ounce, its highest settlement since March 19.</br></br>Gold prices rocketed past the psychologically important $1,300-an-ounce level, breathing new life into the market and luring momentum-chasing funds in as buyers, brokers said. Gold futures had crossed above their 50-day and 100-day moving averages in quick order, sending buy signals to investors who follow such technical indicators.</br></br>Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Wednesday gave a positive assessment of the U.S. economy and reiterated that rates would stay low for a long time. The comments surprised some traders, who had bet against gold expecting a more hawkish view from the Fed, forcing them to cut their losses Thursday by purchasing the metal. Prices for gold, which pays no dividend, tend to weaken in times of rising interest rates, as investors seek out higher-yielding assets.
NEW YORK -- Barnes & Noble.com Inc. is paying about $20 million for a 20% stake in MightyWords Corp., which offers digital versions of books and texts by both wellknown and unknown authors.</br></br>MightyWords is being shed by Fatbrain.com Inc., a Santa Clara, Calif., online retailer of technical books. Under terms, Barnes & Noble.com will begin offering MightyWords' content on its site.</br></br>Technical and educational books have provided a market for electronic publishers for several years. But e-publishing burst out to a wider audience earlier this year when Viacom Inc.'s Simon & Schuster Inc. published a novella by Stephen King exclusively on the Internet.</br></br>MightyWords' writing -- which can be downloaded to a personal computer and then printed onto paper -- includes some romance and fiction by authors including Toni Morrison and Arthur C. Clarke. But much of its subject matter focuses on technical subjects such as business or computing.</br></br>Fatbrain announced it would shed MightyWords in March, just about the time the stock market soured on Internet investments. Instead of taking the company public, Fatbrain turned to private investors. MightyWords' deal with Barnes & Noble.com is part of the company's initial round of funding, which totals $36 million. Vulcan Ventures Inc., the investment vehicle for Microsoft Corp. cofounder Paul Allen, is investing $10 million in MightyWords and $6 million is coming from other investors.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Volume started to fade in the final trading session before Christmas, but investors' high hopes showed no signs of flagging.</br></br>Many continued placing bullish bets, encouraged by economic data showing a rise in durable-goods orders and consumer-spending growth. At the International Securities Exchange, investors were buying about 2.27 new calls for every new put -- after a brief pause when that number dipped below two for the first time this month.</br></br>The Chicago Board Options Exchange volatility index, or VIX, eased 0.22 to 11.23. This 30-day forecast of stock-market volatility has fallen in 13 of the last 17 sessions, for a 15.4% decline this month. This slow and steady ebb toward new nine-year lows is another sign that traders looking ahead for possible stock-market threats believe all is calm.</br></br>But futures on the VIX indicate traders believe the market might become more volatile soon -- at least when companies begin reporting earnings in January. Recent futures prices show traders believe the VIX might rise to about 13.4 at mid-January, 14.5 at mid-February and 15.9 at mid-May.
A deteriorating junk bond market helped spook nervous investors into sending stock and bond prices and the dollar lower.</br></br>The stock market bore the brunt of the retreat. Takeover and brokerage stocks -- the issues that would be hurt the most by junk bond woes -- were among the worst hit. And a spate of sell programs late in the session drove the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 27.74 points to 2679.52, the first close under 2700 since Aug. 23. Retreats in the bond and currency markets weren't so pronounced.</br></br>The unraveling of the heavily leveraged Campeau Corp. was the focus for much of the day. As a series of Campeau disclosures rocked the junk bond market, worries spread about the viability of several proposed takeover deals that depend on junk bonds.</br></br>But analysts said it wasn't just the junk bond market's problems that hurt stocks. Growing concern that Friday's trade report will show exports falling short of expectations hurt the dollar, which in turn hurt bond prices. Traders said the sell-off in bonds sent stock-index futures down, triggering index-arbitrage programs in which traders purchased the futures contracts and sold the underlying stocks.</br></br>A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said that with little economic news to focus on, traders and investors are prone to respond to rumors. He also pointed out that lower-than-expected auto sales for early September, reported yesterday, may be weighing on investors' minds. He said the sluggish auto sales show an economy that may be weaker than had been thought last month, when autos were selling briskly because of incentives. "That may raise a question or two among those who are getting comfortable with the soft-landing theory," he said.

The nation's output of goods and services, squeezed by persistently high interest rates, fell at a 1.9 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. -.; 1</br></br>The inflation rate also dropped sharply from a 9.8 percent annual rate in the first quarter to only 6 percent-in the second, the department said. Food and energy prices rose much less rapidly than in the first quarter. With economic activity essentially flat since January and the high level of interest rates helping to push down many sensitive commodity prices, the rate of inflation as mea.-sured by the GNP deflator was at its lowest level in three years.</br></br>- Most forecasters, including those in the Reagan administration, expect no pickup in the economy until late this year or early in 1982, and some believe the second quarter was the opening phase of what would be the nationï¿½Ûªs second recession in two years.</br></br>In updating its forecast last week in connection with the midyear budget review, the administration declared, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Little or no real output growth is expected during the remainder of the year.ï¿½Û</br></br>Also as part of that forecast, the Reagan economists predicted that the unemployment rate, which was -7.3 percent in June, would average 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter.
POOR PETER! HE MISTAKENLY THINKS MARY JANE HAS TOSSEP HIM OVER-BUT, MISTAKE OR NOT, THE PAIN'S JUST AS BAP!</br></br>Here's dramatic news for taxpayers, who are being told they must ante up still more money to bring down the federal deficit: Enough fat can be squeezed out of the budget, enough extravagance eliminated from government, enough cash saved from going down the drain, that a tax increase shouldnï¿½Ûªt be necessary.</br></br>This word comes from J. Peter Grace, who should know. He heads the Grace Commission, which spent 18 months scrutinizing the governmentï¿½Ûªs books and found 2,478 ways that the federal bureaucracy skins taxpayers. He has shown me evidence that a tax increase won't be needed if Congress will simply cut out the waste and fraud that his commission has uncovered.</br></br>Grace can point out the waste to Congress; he can explain how to tighten financial controls; he can specify exactly what must be cut to wipe out the deficit. In fact, he has already provided Congress with an array of opportunities to avert the consequences of spending-run-wild.</br></br>Yet it wonï¿½Ûªt be easy to derail the government gravy train, which has been on a one-way track for most of this century. Itï¿½Ûªs an express nm by politicians who gain applause today for offering new benefits and disappear into the woodwork tomorrow when the cost has blown the public debt sky-high.
NEW YORK, May 18ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A late round of selling in blue chips blunted an early rally in the stock market today, leaving prices mixed after a busy session.</br></br>Selling pressure was evident in such market leaders as International Business Machines, General Electric and General Motors, as well as the oil group. But some retailing issues were strong.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 14 points at midday, was off 2.23 points at 1,203.56 by the close.</br></br>Evidence has been accumulating in recent days that the recovery from the recession is gaining momentum. As the market opened this morning, the government reported that personal income rose a seasonally adjusted 0.8 percent in April from the month before, for its biggest increase since last July.</br></br>In the last two hours of the session, however, sellers took over, wiping out most of the early gains in stock prices. Merrill Lynch was reported to be handling a long list of sell orders from a single investing institution.
NEW YORK -- RJR Nabisco Inc. is seeking to reduce the interest rates it is paying on some of its $6 billion in bank debt.</br></br>According to individuals with knowledge of the negotiations, RJR approached its banks in recent weeks to try to renegotiate at least a portion of its debt.</br></br>An RJR spokesman said the company regularly talks to its banks and is always looking for ways to reduce the amount and average cost of its debt. A report about the latest negotiations first appeared in Friday's American Banker.</br></br>Recently, RJR reduced its debt outstanding by more than $7 billion, partly by selling more than $2.3 billion of stock and lower-yielding debt to investors.</br></br>RJR's banking group is led by units of Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Chemical Bank and Bankers Trust New York Corp. Spokesmen for each of the banks declined to comment on the talks.

It is a no-win issue that politicians and regulators would prefer to defer, but disparate events may force the Clinton administration to decide how to dispose of radioactive waste fuel from nuclear power plants.</br></br>More than 20,000 tons of highly radioactive used fuel is stored in pools of water adjacent to the nation's 112 nuclear power plants, and the stockpile grows each time a utility refuels. Congress decreed that the material be buried deep below ground in a repository to be built by the Energy Department and specified that Yucca Mountain, Nev., be the only site evaluated.</br></br>Even if Yucca Mountain proves suitable, the repository cannot be ready before 2010, according to the Energy Department. But the law requires the Energy Department to take ownership of the waste beginning in 1998; meanwhile, some nuclear utilities are running out of storage space.</br></br>Congress, however, is reluctant to revise the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which created the Yucca Mountain program, because legislators from every state other than Nevada fear their states could become targets.</br></br>This situation has developed over several years, but recent events have added a sense of urgency to the issue, which dominated the conversation at Hazel R. O'Leary's confirmation hearing as energy secretary.
The Fishmarket, Baltimore's new $25 million entertainment complex near the Inner Harbor, closed abruptly last week, the victim of spotty attendance and a rancorous dispute between its owners and managers over multimillion-dollar losses.</br></br>Opryland USA Inc., the Fishmarket's management company, shut the doors Tuesday, laying off about 400 employees and taking customers by surprise.</br></br>The action drew immediate fire from Fish Market Limited Partnership, the Boston-based group that owns the complex. The group accused Opryland of violating an agreement to underwrite operating expenses and debt service for one year.</br></br>Nashville-based Opryland denied the charge, contending that the owners failed to provide daily expenses, requiring Opryland to add $4.5 million to the operation in non-contractual obligations. The entertainment center also has been hit by a dozen lawsuits by contractors ranging from architects to trash haulers for nearly $1 million in alleged nonpayment of services.</br></br>The two sides are continuing to negotiate, but Baltimore Mayor Kurt L. Schmoke said he holds out little hope of a settlement.
The draft recommendations of the president's commission on deficit reduction call for closing popular tax deductions, higher gas taxes and other revenue raisers to drive tax collections up to 21% of GDP from the historical norm of about 18.5%. Another plan, proposed last week by commission member and former Congressional Budget Office director Alice Rivlin, would impose a 6.5% national sales tax on consumers.</br></br>The claim here, echoed by endless purveyors of conventional wisdom in Washington, is that these added revenues -- potentially a half-trillion dollars a year -- will be used to reduce the $8 trillion to $10 trillion deficits in the coming decade. If history is any guide, however, that won't happen. Instead, Congress will simply spend the money.</br></br>In the late 1980s, one of us, Richard Vedder, and Lowell Gallaway of Ohio University co-authored a often-cited research paper for the congressional Joint Economic Committee (known as the $1.58 study) that found that every new dollar of new taxes led to more than one dollar of new spending by Congress. Subsequent revisions of the study over the next decade found similar results.</br></br>We've updated the research. Using standard statistical analyses that introduce variables to control for business-cycle fluctuations, wars and inflation, we found that over the entire post World War II era through 2009 each dollar of new tax revenue was associated with $1.17 of new spending. Politicians spend the money as fast as it comes in -- and a little bit more.</br></br>We also looked at different time periods (e.g., 1947-2009 vs. 1959-2009), different financial data (fiscal year federal budget data, as well as calendar year National Income and Product Account data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), different lag structures (e.g., relating taxes one year to spending change the following year to allow for the time it takes bureaucracies to spend money), different control variables, etc. The alternative models produce different estimates of the tax-spend relationship -- between $1.05 and $1.81. But no matter how we configured the data and no matter what variables we examined, higher tax collections never resulted in less spending.
When the nation's bankruptcy rate started to drop last year, John Garza felt the impact almost immediately. Business at his suburban Maryland bankruptcy law firm slowed so much that he was forced to let half of his 15 attorneys go, and several of the survivors quit in frustration over their reduced earnings. Mr. Garza, for his part, had time for other pursuits. "I played a ton a golf," he remembers.</br></br>These days, tee times are down and court time is up. The caseload of Mr. Garza's firm rose more than 15% last month alone, leading him to hire a new attorney. "We're like vultures perched on the telephone pole, waiting for the disaster so that we can eat," he says of his firm, which handles both personal and business bankruptcies. "Well, the vultures are about to spread their wings."</br></br>With interest rates up and the economy slowing, many households are discovering that their bills for years of torrid spending are coming due just as they are ill prepared to pay them. As a result, growing numbers of Americans are seeking court protection from their creditors. Personal bankruptcies, as measured by a 12-week moving average of filings, have increased nearly 10% since January. The moving average hit 24,288 for the week ending Nov. 4, up from 22,291 in the week ending Jan. 1, according to data from Visa.</br></br>Extended over an entire year, that pace would translate into about 1.26 million personal bankruptcy filings, a notch lower than the 1.28 million filings recorded last year. Indeed, after rising steadily for most of the past decade, personal bankruptcies fell in 1999 amid low interest rates and solid wage gains associated with the nation's ultratight labor market.</br></br>But what concerns many analysts is that the pace of bankruptcies appears to be accelerating. SMR Research Corp., a consumer-debt research firm in Hackettstown, N.J., estimates that bankruptcy filings will rise as much as 15% next year, easily surpassing 1998's record 1.4 million filings.
NEW YORK -- A portrait of the art market after this week would probably contain a greater share of somber hues.</br></br>Art dealers and art collectors across the country say the wild swings in the stock market may damp some of the euphoria that has characterized the art market in recent years. A number of dealers report that buyers who had paintings on hold or who had planned to purchase paintings are calling to postpone or cancel the deals. And some art experts expect the stratospheric prices that some works have commanded will return to more realistic levels -- just as the important fall auction season is beginning.</br></br>"I think the speculative fever (in art-buying) will subside now," says Lewis Manilow, a Chicago real-estate investor and major art collector. "This (stock market crash) is a dash of realism, and the art world needs some realism, too. It can't be endless."</br></br>Adds W. Graham Arader III, a print dealer who owns galleries in seven cities: "The art boom is over. It just got too high and it's over." Mr. Arader says he did a brisk business in August, especially to "Forbes 400 people," but that even before the crash, less-affluent collectors had stopped buying. "We did seven antique shows in the past three weeks, and we couldn't sell a thing," he says. "That has me scared."</br></br>No one expects the art market to collapse in a heap: There is no Dow Jones average that lumps together Louis XIV furniture and Picasso paintings. "Blue chip" art works have historically held their value much better than lower quality pieces in a downturn, and the Van Gogh iris painting set for sale at Sotheby's on Nov. 11 is still expected to fetch about $30 million, the second-highest price ever for a painting. Sotheby's is the auction house unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
Careful analysis of the surge in U.S. productivity growth in the second half of the 1990s suggests the gains aren't simply the result of strong overall economic growth, Federal Reserve governor Edward M. Gramlich said yesterday in a speech in London.</br></br>Instead, the new, higher rate of growth in productivity -- the amount of goods and services produced for each hour worked -- appears likely to last even as economic growth slows, Gramlich said.</br></br>After the speech, he told reporters that U.S. productivity growth was still accelerating in the first nine months of last year, the Dow Jones news service reported. When economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter, productivity growth did as well, but only modestly.</br></br>"So it looks like productivity is hanging in there even with our slowdown," the Fed board member said.</br></br>Gramlich told the International Bond Congress that numerous studies indicate that the long-term trend in productivity growth increased in the United States from about 1.5 percent annually during the two decades from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s to about 2.5 percent more recently. That acceleration was caused primarily by two things, he said.
TOKYO--The head of the Philippine central bank said he sees room to cut interest rates further as inflation is mild, while expressing concern over falling exports and potentially destabilizing capital inflows.</br></br>His concerns mirror those of other export-oriented economies in Asia, which face weakening demand in Europe and the U.S. as well as inflows of speculative investment driven by easy monetary policy in major economies.</br></br>"Right now if you look at the inflation picture, the forecast is quite benign," Bangko Sentral ng Philipinas Gov. Amando Tetangco said in an interview. "The average for this year is likely going to fall closer to the low end of the inflation target."</br></br>Mr. Tetangco, speaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund annual fall meetings in Tokyo, said he sees the same trend for next year.</br></br>Philippine on-year consumer-price inflation slowed to 3.6% in September from 3.8% in August. The central bank's full-year target is between 3% and 5%.
Author: Emily Steel</br></br>In the weeks before the New Hampshire primary last month, Linda Twombly of Nashua says she was peppered with online ads for Republican Senate hopeful Jim Bender.</br></br>It was no accident. An online tracking company called RapLeaf Inc. had correctly identified her as a conservative who is interested in Republican politics, has an interest in the Bible and contributes to political and environmental causes. Mrs. Twombly's profile is part of RapLeaf's rich trove of data, garnered from a variety of sources and which both political parties have tapped.</br></br>RapLeaf knows even more about Mrs. Twombly and millions of other Americans: their real names and email addresses.</br></br>This makes RapLeaf a rare breed. Rival tracking companies also gather minute detail on individual Americans: They know a tremendous amount about what you do. But most trackers either can't or won't keep the ultimate piece of personal information--your name--in their databases. The industry often cites this layer of anonymity as a reason online tracking shouldn't be considered intrusive.
Author: Rhiannon Hoyle</br></br>The price of gold is back at record levels. But whether it can hit $1,500 in the next few months could depend on whether the U.S. Federal Reserve sticks with an ultraeasy monetary policy that is pushing down the dollar.</br></br>Right now, the Fed appears divided over the outlook for its quantitative easing program, known to the market at QE2 and scheduled to end on June 30, and the possibility of higher interest rates later this year, even if U.S. unemployment remains high.</br></br>Any fresh signs that the Fed remains concerned about the U.S. economy would boost gold, which is seen as an alternative currency and often attracts strong interest in times of economic uncertainty and unusually low or negative interest rates after adjusting for inflation, as is the case now. An even stronger signal for gold could come from an extension of the Fed's program beyond June, which for now, at least, seems likely.</br></br>But any move by the Fed to exit quantitative easing or raise interest rates faster than analysts expect would be detrimental for gold prices, which has come to rely on the U.S.'s super-loose policy. Prices may also come under pressure as investors adjust to life after QE2 and react to any signs that the U.S. economic recovery is gaining traction.
The latest idea to help cash-strapped state governments and resuscitate the U.S. economy: Revive former President Richard Nixon's plan for sharing federal revenues with the states.</br></br>Alice Rivlin, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former Clinton administration budget director, floated the idea this week, with a twist. From 1972 to 1980, the federal government sent unrestricted cash to the states regardless of the economic climate. Ms. Rivlin proposes creating a trigger to automatically start the payments when the economy enters a recession. This way, the federal government could come to the aid of states, helping them avoid poorly timed tax increases and social-service spending cuts.</br></br>But Mr. Nixon's fellow Republicans long ago disowned his idea, and Congress is unlikely to embrace it. Indeed, for nearly a year, states have lobbied Congress for aid only to come away empty-handed. There was bipartisan support in the Senate for a plan to temporarily raise the federal share of funding for Medicaid, a health plan for low-income and disabled people jointly paid for by the states and federal government. The idea has slowly died in the Republican-controlled House. More recently, states have failed so far to get an agreement to increase funding for cash assistance and welfare-to-work programs.</br></br>Why can't the states get any help from Washington? A majority in Congress, mainly Republicans, don't want to approve new spending because of the growing federal deficit -- exactly what killed general revenue sharing 20 years ago. They would rather approve spending for which they can take credit.</br></br>Some argue that states helped to create their own crisis by unrealistically relying on uninterrupted tax revenue fattened by '90s personal income-tax and other gains while also enacting spending programs and reducing taxes.
The question of the hour was whether people refinancing their mortgages are being deceived and cheated.</br></br>Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Calif.), chairman of the House banking subcommittee on consumer affairs and coinage, thinks they are.</br></br>"Over the past few days, my phones and fax machines have been besieged with consumers experiencing difficulties in mortgage refinancing," he said this week as he opened a hearing on legislation he has introduced "to stop numerous scams by unscrupulous lenders and mortgage brokers who prey on consumers."</br></br>The bill, which Torres said he hopes to attach to a pending housing authorization bill, would apply to refinanced mortgages the kinds of consumer-protection laws that cover original mortgages, including detailed, advance estimates of loan terms and charges.</br></br>It also would require lenders to honor locked-in interest rates within the agreed-to time period (typically 60 days), and outlaw use of the Rule of 78s, a mathematical formula sometimes used to calculate the interest rebate owed to the consumer on a mortgage being refinanced.
A Federal Reserve Board survey indicated yesterday that banks made relatively little immediate use of the authority given them in early December to raise interest rates on time deposits.</br></br>Less than one-fourth of all banks which belong to the Federal Reserve System, the Board said, raised rates on any type of time or savings deposit immediately after early December or said they had plans to do so.</br></br>In a move toward tighter money, the Board on Dec. 3 had raised the discount rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the fee banks must pay the Federal Reserve to borrow moneyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and authorized an increase in the interest rate on time deposits to 5.5 per cent.</br></br>Tlie previous rate was 4 per cent on time deposits of 30-89 days and 4.5 per cent on deposits of 90 or more days. The maximum 4 per cent interest rate on passbook savings accounts remained unchanged.</br></br>In its survey, the Board asked member banks to report interest rates as of Dec. 3 and any changes made after that date. Reports were received, from 6192 of the 6221 [member banks, the Board I said.
Linking workers' rights to international trade is an idea whose time has come and stayed, despite the best efforts of free trade ideologues to chase it away. In looming congressional debates about "fast track" negotiating authority, the Bush administration and Congress confront powerful demands from workers, trade unionists and a wider public for rules protecting human rights and labor rights, not just corporate investments, in trade agreements.</br></br>"That's protectionism" is a stock reply of government officials, international economists, multinational executives and many pundits trying to make a labor rights-trade link go away. Instead of engaging critics on the merits, their one-dimensional argument goes like this: (1) Expanded trade spurs investment, growth and wealth creation in developing countries; (2) after they can afford it, developing countries and companies operating in them will stop violating workers' rights and share the wealth.</br></br>The first proposition is plausible, leaving aside debates about long-term vs. speculative investment and sustainable vs. destructive growth. But the conclusion does not follow. After wealth has been created, respecting workers' rights and paying them fairly is still a choice, one that doesn't always depend on economics. Instead, choosing justice for workers is driven by organizing, bargaining and political action, increasingly on an international scale.</br></br>In Sri Lanka a few weeks ago, I met dozens of young women from factories in that country's fast-growing free trade zones who explained that the government's Board of Investment sets up company- controlled "worker councils" and gets rid of workers who try to form real unions.</br></br>China's economy has grown impressively in recent years, but workers attempting to form independent unions there are dismissed, harassed and jailed. The rate of fatal factory fires keeps pace with the booming apparel export sectors of Bangladesh and Thailand. When Malaysia tried to pass a law allowing independent union formation in its burgeoning electronics sector, U.S.-based multinationals mounted a collective threat to decamp for Indonesia unless the law was reversed. They got their way.
She has never felt confident with big numbers, so Kip Fordney brings along a college math major to count the money sure to pile up. Fordney, the head of Shippensburg's parks and recreation department, walks through downtown carrying a one-pound deli container turned into a collection cup and stops at each storefront to deliver a rehearsed pitch. "We're trying to save the Fourth of July fireworks," she says, over and over. "Can you help?"</br></br>After each stop, Fordney, 49, hands the donations to her assistant, who thumbs through the checks and bills before offering a running total.</br></br>No matter how many times they recount, the numbers don't add up. Fireworks, held in Memorial Park every summer since the 1940s, would cost $5,300; a dwindling budget and lackluster donations have left Fordney responsible for raising every cent. If she fails to secure the money in the next few days, the town of 5,600 people in south-central Pennsylvania will forgo fireworks and cancel the disc jockey on its self-proclaimed "Best Day of Summer." The residents who gather annually at the high school football field to lie on blankets, listen to "The Star-Spangled Banner," and drink free Wild Cherry Pepsi and Mountain Dew will instead be left to contemplate a dark sky, in yet the latest reminder of the economic crisis.</br></br>More than 40 communities across the country have already canceled their Fourth of July fireworks, conceding to a new reality: Shooting off a colorful array of explosives, an American birthright since 1777, is now a luxury that borders on wasteful. Unlike in Washington, where tens of thousands will fight for position on the Mall, these are places that represent what Independence Day means in most of America -- a hillside covered with friends and neighbors, a few dozen fireworks set off by the volunteers from the fire department, a sweet, small-town sense of community on a warm summer night.</br></br>And yet the mayor in Lowell, Mass., laid off 48 employees and canceled fireworks earlier this month, reasoning that it saved employee No. 49. Some towns near Washington, from Herndon to Laurel, said sluggish fundraising could force them to scale back. Chesapeake Beach, Md., will shoot off fireworks on July 3 because it procured a discounted rate; organizers in Charlottesville warned that next year, fireworks might be canceled entirely.
The multibillion-dollar Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) survived its most serious challenge so far in Congress yesterday, saved by some of the Senate's most vocal budget-cutters.</br></br>Thirty-three senators who voted last month against President Clinton's budget package, largely on grounds it did not include enough spending cuts, brushed aside critics' charges that the giant Texas atom smasher amounted to a high-tech "piece of pork" and voted to spend $640 million on it next year.</br></br>Among them were Minority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.), Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and several Democrats who split with Clinton over the budget, including Sens. J. Bennett Johnston (La.) and David L. Boren (Okla.). The Senate vote was critical because the House earlier had voted 280 to 150 to kill the project and its foes were given a long- shot chance of prevailing in the Senate because of concern over the budget deficit. Opponents picked up 10 votes from last year, but still fell short, largely because so many states share in contracts and other benefits from the project.</br></br>The issue now goes to a House-Senate conference as part of a $22.5 billion spending bill for fiscal 1994 energy and water projects. Faced with a similar clash between the two chambers last year, conferees agreed to continue construction of the SSC.</br></br>The huge project, estimated to cost $10 billion or more when completed over the next decade, is the largest science project in history - a 54-mile tunnel with magnets to force high-speed collision of protons in a way that scientists hope can reveal the nature of matter and other mysteries of the universe. Supporters, led by Johnston, in whose state the magnets are being built, described the project as essential to U.S. leadership in scientific breakthroughs and accused its opponents of indulging in "flat earth" thinking.
The eroding value of TV Guide, once the premier weekly publication in the country, continues to haunt Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. as the company disclosed it was taking another charge against earnings -- of $1.3 billion -- because of the write-down of the magazine to its "fair market value."</br></br>The noncash charge triggered a loss of $953.8 million, or $2.32 a share, for the second quarter as the Pasadena, Calif., publisher of TV Guide and owner of patents for on-screen television-program guides finally released financial results for the quarter. In the first quarter, the company took a $5.3 billion charge against earnings related to its 2000 merger with TV Guide Inc. The second-quarter loss widened from a loss of $134.8 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.</br></br>Gemstar failed to certify its financial results by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Aug. 14 deadline, as auditors continued to review its books for possible accounting problems. Gemstar's results remain uncertified until the auditors finish their review.</br></br>For the quarter, revenue fell 15% to $271.7 million. Gemstar had revenue declines at both its TV Guide and patent-licensing units, but revenue was up at its interactive unit because of increased "e-commerce" revenue and wagering activities on its horse-racing channels.</br></br>Once boasting a market capitalization of more than $25 billion, Gemstar now is struggling to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market as its stock has collapsed to under $5 a share and a market cap of almost $2 billion. Gemstar executives met yesterday with Nasdaq officials in hopes of preventing its stock from being delisted. In 4 p.m. trading, Gemstar shares were off 10%, or 34 cents, at $2.90.
The money supply, which fell sharply in the week ended Nov. 23. rose sharply in the latest reporting week, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday. The money supply ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½currency in circulation and checking accountsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½has been behaving erratically in recent months, making it difficult for the central hank to control its growth.</br></br>In another development, the Senate Banking Committee majority said that the Federal Reserve should supply enough money to tire economy to permit the economy to grow 5 per cent in 1978. Federal Reserve chairman Arthur F.Burns said the central bank expects the economy to grow ï¿½Û¢1.5 per cent next year.</br></br>The Fed tries to control money growth by buying and selling government securities on the open market. The six Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee disagreed with the Democratic majority and warned that too fast money growth could result in rapid inflation.</br></br>In the money report released yesterday, the Fed said that ihe money supply averaged $333.2 billion in the week ended Nov. 30. compared with $331.4 billion the week before.

n L.F. Rothschild Holdings Inc., hurt by internal strife, heavy losses and growing competition in the aftermath of the stock market plunge, announced a severe restructuring plan yesterday to narrow its business and cut staff by 40 percent.</br></br>Rothschild became the third big Wall Street firm in the five days to announce impending deep cutbacks in operations and staff. E.F. Hutton Group Inc. and Kidder, Peabody & Co. announced restructuring steps last week that could result in losses of up to 7,000 jobs.</br></br>Andrew L. Berger, president of Rothschild's broker-dealer subsidiary, L.F. Rothschild & Co., said th& firm would achieve some of the layoffs by phasing out the clearing activities of its retail accounts, meaning that Rothschild would no longer handle the financial settlements of clients' securities transactions.</br></br>o Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities rose sharply in yesterday's auction with six-month bills hitting the highest level since mid-October.</br></br>The Treasury sold $6.4 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.81 percent, up from 5.49 percent last week. Another $6.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.42 percent, up from 6.12 percent last week.
-- For the past six days, the world's political, academic and business luminaries who gathered in this Swiss mountain resort struggled -- between bites of lobster tail and sips of Louis Roederer champagne -- to comprehend the reasons behind growing populist backlash against globalization.</br></br>At seminars and panel discussions held in a fortress-like conference center surrounded by armed guards and barbed wire, they were confronted by a staccato burst of statistics depicting the monstrous inequalities of our age: that more than a billion people live on less than $1 a day, that half of humanity has never made or received a phone call and that Manhattan has more Internet connections than all of Africa.</br></br>But as they descended today from the snowy alpine peaks, there was an air of disappointment among many of the 2,000 participants who were brought together by the World Economic Forum to ponder how to "Bridge the Divides." "When people talk about globalization, what we see is a world that is divided into two," said Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's president. "There is a structural fault of poverty: on one side, there are the powerful and the wealthy, and on the other side, there are the powerless and the poor."</br></br>The exhilarating promises of globalization -- of new technologies, the elevation of living standards through free trade and the global web of mutual interests that was supposed to render wars obsolete -- have given way to fresh suspicions about the need to shatter traditions and break down the last barriers to the flow of capital, people and ideas.</br></br>Given the growing hostility to globalization, Mexico's new reformist president, Vicente Fox, said the world's industrial democracies need to acknowledge that the present methods of reaching out to the illiterate and the impoverished are simply not working. Instead of bridging the divide, he said, the chasm between rich and poor is only getting worse.
WASHINGTON -- More than four years into the economic expansion, wage increases remain modest.</br></br>The Labor Department said yesterday that total compensation costs rose just 2.9% in the 12 months ended in June. That's slightly less than the inflation rate of 3% during the same period. Wage and salary costs were just keeping up with inflation during the year ended in June, and benefit costs were up just 2.7%, the department's employment-cost index indicated. In the second quarter, compensation costs rose 0.7%, slightly more than the 0.6% gain registered in the first quarter. Compensation costs include wages or salary and benefits.</br></br>There are several explanations for the sluggishness of compensation gains: international competition, the decline of labor unions, health-care cost containment, companies subcontracting their extra work and automation.</br></br>"Manufacturing and service companies have really elected to put the squeeze on what they pay their workers," says Stephen Roach, chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Co. "They've had to."</br></br>The slow increase in compensation costs is all the more surprising when productivity increases are considered. Over the past few years, the trend in productivity growth has been about a half a percentage point more than it was in the 1970s or 1980s. Companies, meanwhile, have become fat with cash from the profits. "Within a year of a meaningful uptick in productivity, we should see a meaningful uptick in wages," Mr. Roach says.
NEW YORK, Nov. 7 (UPI)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market eked out a small gain today in moderate trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where investors remained on the side- ï¿½ï¿½Êï¿½_ lines waiting for new developments.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, off more than three points at the outset, gained .2.81 to 671.93. It had;, been ahead around six points during the session. The closely-watched blue-chip . indicator lost more than five points-in late profit-taking Wednesday.	.</br></br>Standard.- & Poorï¿½Ûªs - 500-stock index gained 0.46 td 75.21. The NYSE index rose 0.28 to 39.74. Advances topped.. declines, 850 to 543, among the 1,786 issues crossing'the tape.</br></br>Analysts said investors continued to be encouraged . by recent declines in interest rates. Many major banks have lowered the prime lending rate they charge creditworthy corporate customers-to 10% or 11 per cent.</br></br>Many investors were hopeful the rate would decline further. First National City Bank of New York, second largest in the nation and a trendsetter, was scheduled to make its weekly rate figures available Friday morning. Citibankï¿½Ûªs present rate is 10% per cent.
Some corporate mergers have little effect on customers. But when big airlines merge, it changes life for travelers, leading to higher ticket prices, poorer service and maybe even a switch in the credit card you carry.</br></br>For the fractured airline industry, where nine big airlines fight coast-to-coast, removing large competitors and bulking up flight schedules could be a way to better survive high oil prices and recession instead of the bankruptcies and turmoil of past downturns. That's why Delta Air Lines Inc. may be considering formal merger talks with either UAL Corp.'s United Airlines or Northwest Airlines Corp., and why analysts think multiple major marriages could lie ahead.</br></br>"By default or design, I think it's going to happen. If it doesn't, they'll be back in the tank again," said Gordon Bethune, the former head of Continental Airlines who has been advising some big airline investors on merger prospects.</br></br>But for travelers, big-airline couplings historically have meant headaches. Airline employees endure change and disappointment -- which could make them act grumpier toward customers. Some communities could see reduced service if mergers allow the combined airlines to close hub operations -- would a merged Delta and Northwest still need hubs in Cincinnati and Memphis, for example? Higher ticket prices are likely; airlines merge in part so that they will have more pricing power.</br></br>But the biggest peril for consumers is poorer service -- late flights, lost baggage, confusion at airports, ticketing troubles and changes in frequent-flier program rules.

WASHINGTON -- For the first time in years, the dreaded word "recession" is back as a buzzword. Oddly, though, it will be months -- or even years -- before economists know for sure if the U.S. has entered one, partly because the definition is fluid.</br></br>The most common definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of economic contraction. This was the explanation President Clinton used to defend his legacy when reporters asked whether President-elect George W. Bush was inheriting a Clinton recession.</br></br>But that definition isn't widely embraced by economists. "Economic growth is sort of more on a continuum, there's nothing special about zero," says Harvard University economist Greg Mankiw. His introductory economics textbook, "Principles of Economics," defines a recession more generally as "a period of declining real incomes and rising unemployment." In some cases, he says, two quarters may be too much. "If you had a big enough fall in one quarter, you'd probably call that a recession, too," he says.</br></br>For professional economists, the ultimate arbiter of economic peaks and troughs is the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee. "Basically, a recession is whatever they want to call a recession," says Mr. Mankiw.</br></br>The NBER is a nonpartisan, nonprofit think tank devoted to promoting the understanding of how the economy works. Founded in 1920 and based in Cambridge, Mass., the NBER has been dating expansions and recessions for decades. At their Web site (www.nber.org), readers can examine the ebb and flow of U.S. economic growth back to 1854.
NEW YORK -- Sparked by tame inflation news and bolstered by the strength of the technology sector, small-capitalization and Nasdaq Stock Market issues jumped to records.</br></br>Still, while the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index hit its third record in the past four sessions, the small-cap market continues to underperform the broad market and blue-chip sector.</br></br>Computer-related stocks were one of the strongest industry groups. But echoing the overall market, larger tech stocks outperformed smaller ones.</br></br>"That's been the case since July," said Stephen Cohen, director of technology research at First Albany. In July, when the marketwide plunge took its severest toll on small-caps, many investors "were taught the Roach Motel lesson about small-cap stocks: They're easy to get into but tough to get out of."</br></br>The Russell 2000 rose 1.67, or 0.46%, to a record 367.52. The Nasdaq Composite Index, at a record 1346.36, was up 15.45, or 1.16%.
President Richard Nixon appointed the first energy czars, John Love and later William Simon, in the wake of the 1973 gasoline shortage. Congress mandated a drug czar during the crack cocaine epidemic in 1982. And President Bill Clinton named Ira Magaziner his health czar to craft legislation in 1993.</br></br>It's hardly a record of success; problems persist in all those areas. But with the automobile companies in crisis and the public tired of providing bailouts for American corporations, Congress and the Bush administration are on the verge of creating a new czar or committee to oversee efforts to rescue Detroit's largest automakers.</br></br>"If they can no longer pay their own way, it is entirely appropriate for someone to put the hammer down and say 'That's it,' " said Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the court-appointed monitor for the scandal-ridden communications giant, WorldCom. "If taxpayers are going to support General Motors, let's turn General Motors into a company worthy of it."</br></br>The choice of a czar -- or czarina -- is the plan's first obstacle. President Bush, who would appoint the czar or overseers, and Democratic leaders in Congress have very different ideas about who would make the best choice.</br></br>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) mentioned former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker as the type of person she would support. As he exited an hour-long meeting with House Democrats yesterday afternoon, Volcker waved off reporters' questions, declining to state whether he was interested in the post. Volcker has already been tapped to advise President-elect Barack Obama on economic issues.
President Carter named Civil Aeronautics Board Chairman Alfred E. Kahn to head his new anti-inflation effort yesterday amid general skepticism at home and abroad about its chances for success.</br></br>On foreign money markets, the dollar plunged to new lows and gold prices hit new heights within hours after Carter unveiled his new program ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½his third since taking officeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½on Tuesday night.</br></br>In this country, business leaders offered selective support, praising Carterï¿½Ûªs pledge to curb government spending and deficits. The huge Teamsters union, which will lead off next yearï¿½Ûªs heavy round of collective bargaining, also indicated support, but of a heavily qualified kind. Other unions remained silent.</br></br>Within the government, officials were gearing up machinery to monitor compliance with the new wage and price guidelines, readying detailed rules for formal promulgation within a week or so and manning telephone banks to answer questions from business and labor leaders.</br></br>The plan calls on workers to limit wage increases to 7 percent a year and companies to restrain prices by a less specific formula, with limited government sanctions for violators and a tax rebate to encourage compliance. It is designed to reduce inflation from its present level of nearly 8 percent to between 6 and 6*6 percent next year.
NEW YORK -- Signals that war isn't inevitable in the Middle East sent stock and bond prices surging, more than wiping out early declines that were sparked by surprising economic news.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 17.82 points higher to 2448.02, after being down as much as 20 points in midmorning. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices gained 1/8 point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount, following a 1/4-point morning drop.</br></br>Stronger-than-expected economic growth was reported for the third quarter, and both stocks and bonds slid in reaction. That is because investors concluded the news might dissuade the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates further, said Thomas Mudge, market analyst at Bailard Biehl & Kaiser, a money manager based in San Mateo, Calif. The Fed cut the key federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point on Monday.</br></br>Besides surprise, the news that the economy grew 1.8% in the third quartertwice as much as expectations -- also generated skepticism. Analysts cited extremely negative readings in recent consumer confidence surveys and the expectation that October jobs data, scheduled for release Friday, will show unemployment continuing to rise.</br></br>"The question is," said Mr. Mudge, was last quarter's economic growth "really that strong, or is it a big fakeout? With all the cross currents, what you get is investor paralysis."
Over a buffet lunch of shrimp linguine, charcoal-broiled chicken and grilled vegetables, Rep. Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) picked up more than $15,000 in contributions he didn't even have to ask for.</br></br>All he had to do was show up at a private room at the National Democratic Club here and answer questions about health care, crime, entitlements and his campaign for reelection. His benefactors were representatives of a coalition of 16 unions and other groups that speak for more than 2 million federal and postal employees and retirees. Collectively, their political action committees (PACs) dole out $10 million each election cycle to candidates and political parties.</br></br>"I tell you," Strickland boasted to his hosts, "I am proud of the money I get from you. It's from real people, working people."</br></br>Two years ago as a challenger, Strickland was visiting PAC offices and hustling contributions by phone to raise enough money to unseat Rep. Bob McEwen (R). Now, he is the incumbent and contributions are flowing more freely - sometimes without solicitation.</br></br>In some respects, as freshmen lawmakers such as Strickland reap the benefits of incumbency, they become more entrenched in the system they campaigned to reform. This poses a dilemma for many in the Class of '92, the largest and most diverse collection of House newcomers in decades: How do they maintain credibility as outsiders with the voters back home if they behave like insiders in Washington? "The great majority of freshmen ran in 1992 on changing the political system in Washington," said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan public interest lobbying group. "The majority made public commitments to support comprehensive campaign finance reform. But once they got here there were only a handful of representatives who really worked at it. A great majority of the freshmen did not deliver on the impression they left with their constituents that they were really going to try to change this place."
Not with a bang but with a whimper. That's how the Clinton-Gore economy stumbles to an end. It's not a pretty sight. But will we end up mired in recession? Don't bet on it. We should skirt a recession and resume our prosperous march, as long as Congress supports, rather than undermines, President-elect George W. Bush.</br></br>As we enter the Christmas retail season, it's easy to come up with a list of sad data as long as Santa's happy list of holiday gifts. Durable goods orders dropped 5.5% in October and, of course, the Nasdaq Stock Market has lost 32% in 2000. The economic bears are on a rampage, forcing the bulls to hibernate for the winter.</br></br>How did we get here? Wasn't it just yesterday that gross domestic product growth was galloping at a 5% pace and financial authors sparked a bidding war over Dow 36,000, Dow 40,000 or Dow 100,000? Who broke up the party and launched this battle against our prosperity? Let's use the acronym FOE, pointing our indignant finger at the Federal Reserve Board, OPEC and the euro. Each of these institutions has knocked us a few degrees off course. Of the three, at least the Federal Reserve had good intentions.</br></br>Back on May 16, the day the Fed pushed up short-term rates by 50 basis points, I suggested on this page that the economy was preparing to slow on its own, and that bond bears worried too much about inflation. (If only my bet on the New York Mets came out so lucky.) "Be careful what you wish for. . ." goes the old saw. So now the Fed has achieved the slowdown it tried to engineer. Fewer cars are rolling off the assembly lines in Detroit, and carpenters will hammer fewer nails into new homes this winter. The junk-bond market has slammed its doors, and the Fed reports that bank loan officers have choked lending standards tighter today than during the 1998 credit crunch.</br></br>On Tuesday, Alan Greenspan prudently and presciently softened his inflation warnings, pointing out that a flabby stock market could "signal or precipitate a softening" in spending. For now, at least, we don't have to fret about irrational exuberance in share prices.
FRANKFURT, Feb. 5-The United States' and its western partners can avoid a recession if financial markets are convinced that "the United States i3 willing to defend its currency," central bank president Karl Otto Poehl said in an interview today.</br></br>Poehl said he believes "there is a chance" of exchange rate stability in the wake of Black Monday, both because the Oct. 19 market plunge dampened fears of inflation and because more progress than is realized has been made in reducing global trade imbalances.</br></br>But he warned that discussions such as the Washington meeting Thursday between West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and Treasury Secretary James A. Baker 111 have limited value. "I am not against close cooperation, but [these discussions] should be kept on a low-profile basis," Poehl said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We donï¿½Ûªt want to create too many expectations.ï¿½Û [In Washington, Stoltenberg told reporters that the close coordination between finance ministers and central bank chiefs produced a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½more promisingï¿½Û outlook for the world economy this year than most had thought possible in the immediate aftermath of the global market collapse. He said this coordination led to the joint statement issued just before Christmas, as well as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not secret but open market inter-</br></br>[Aq a result, he said, there is a "more stableï¿½Û situation with exchange rates, the dollar has recovered some strength and there is a change in the expectations of currency traders, who had been pushing -the dollar down. [Stoltenberg said his talks this week with Baker and Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½confirmed and strengthenedï¿½Û his conviction that Western Europe, the United States and Japan now believe in good international cooperation to get through a year "of problems and some risksï¿½Û in the international economy.</br></br>[This represents a sharp change from the situation before the market crash, which was blamed in part on Bakerï¿½Ûªs public criticism of West Germanyï¿½Ûªs economic policies and a threat that the United States would let the value of the dollar fall, hurting Bonnï¿½Ûªs export-oriented industries, if the government refused to stimulate its economic growth. Stoltenberg said West German growth would be about lVi percent to 2 percent this year "if there is no major volatility in exchange rates.ï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª]
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert Heller said he favors tying international monetary policy to a broadly based "basket" of commodity prices, a move that is endorsed by many supply-side economists.</br></br>Mr. Heller's remarks provide fresh evidence that he can be counted among the Fed's supply-siders, who have been gaining strength as more board members have been appointed by President Reagan.</br></br>The comments also underscore the increasing importance the Fed is placing on commodity prices now that the central bank has deemed money-supply figures a poor guide to policy. Another Fed governor, Wayne Angell, also has said he would use commodity prices as a primary benchmark.</br></br>Fed Chairman Paul Volcker pays considerable attention to commodity prices as an indicator of general inflation trends. But the Fed chief has questioned whether policy "rules," such as a commodity standard, are workable.</br></br>Many supply-siders -- who generally emphasize stimulating output rather than managing demand -- argue that the Fed should tighten credit when prices of gold and other commodities are rising and loosen credit when such prices are falling.
Mortgage interest rates dropped this week for the third week in a row and, at a national average of 7.77 percent, are nearing the 19-year low reached last September. Rates in the Washington area are even lower, declining to 7.58 percent.</br></br>This weekï¿½Ûªs drop puts the national interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan slightly higher than the 7.72 percent recorded four months ago and opens up new opportunities for borrowers who have been waiting to refinance their homes or to buy new dwellings, according to financial experts.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Significantly, of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the country, Washington has the lowest ARM," or adjustable-rate mortgage, said Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank</br></br>Rate Monitor, a Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter that surveys interest rates nationally. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It means that Washington area institutions are bidding for business."</br></br>Nationally, ARMs are at 4.93 percent for a 30-year loan whose rate is adjusted annually, down from 5.06 percent last week, Heady said. In the Washington area, the same loan carries a 4.33 percent rate, down from 4.52 percent last week.
FRANKFURT -- The Federal Reserve's hefty interest-rate cut adds to the mounting pressure on the European Central Bank to follow suit today to boost the flagging euro-zone economy, but stubbornly high inflation and national politics are putting the world's No. 2 central bank in a bind.</br></br>Inflation isn't falling significantly despite the slowdown, and remains above the ECB's target of 2%. In addition, inflation rates among the 12 nations in the euro zone are diverging. This makes a one-size-fits-all monetary policy more difficult to practice and pits the interests of small, higher-inflation countries against those of the large nations that would likely benefit from lower rates.</br></br>At today's meeting, the ECB will weigh whether the bad news on the economy warrants a shift in focus from fighting inflation to supporting growth, a move that could by extension aid the U.S. and global economy. Over the past month, further evidence of a halting recovery has continued to pour in. Just yesterday, Germany reported that orders to its manufacturing industry fell a monthly 2.5% in September, dimming the prospects of Europe's largest economy. And in France, the region's second-largest powerhouse, industrial demand fell in the third quarter of this year, and a survey showed that business executives expect a further drop in the fourth. The Fed's decision also underscores the weakness of the U.S. economy, which Europe traditionally counts on to pull it out of a slump.</br></br>Already this year, the ECB did an about-face on its attitude toward inflation. During the summer, the bank was gearing up to raise borrowing costs but had to quickly retract that plan as the recovery and stock markets faltered. Still, during the past few days, public statements from ECB officials suggested the 18-member governing council hadn't yet reached an agreement to cut rates as early as today. The ECB has surprised markets before, however.</br></br>Some economists believe that if the ECB holds rates steady today, it will simply postpone the inevitable, miss a chance to appear proactive, and come under fire from the politicians, banks and media. "What do they win or lose by waiting another four weeks?" said Julian von Landesberger, an economist with HVB Group in Munich. "Until now the ECB was much too optimistic with regard to growth next year."
A widening array of financial-market problems threatens to trigger a new phase in the global credit crunch, extending it beyond the risky mortgages that have cost banks and investors more than $100 billion in losses and helped push the U.S. economy toward recession.</br></br>In the past few days, low-rated corporate loans -- the kind that fueled the buyout boom of recent years -- have plummeted in value. As a result, banks are expected to try to unload some of those loans this week at fire-sale prices.</br></br>Nervous buyers also have retreated in recent days from the market for securities backed by student loans and municipal bonds, roiling some corners of the short-term money markets. Similarly, investors have recoiled from debt backed by commercial real estate, such as office buildings.</br></br>Over the weekend, the world's top banking authorities warned that the U.S.-led economic slowdown and continued uncertainty about securities could lead banks to further reduce their lending, and choke off economic activity.</br></br>One sign of investors' anxiety: Standard & Poor's said its index of the prices on high-risk corporate loans fell to a record low of 86.28 cents on the dollar at the end of last week.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve left its key short-term interest rate unchanged, confirming that its fears of imminent inflation have subsided. But economists are divided over whether the central bank will still have to tighten monetary policy in the coming months to damp growth.</br></br>Yesterday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was the second consecutive time that Fed officials chose to leave monetary policy alone after pushing through a controversial quarter-point increase in the federal-funds rate in March. The Fed's target for the federal-funds rate, or the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight, remains at 5 1/2%.</br></br>Although the inaction was widely anticipated, the stock market rallied after the decision was disclosed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, down nearly 20 points just before the 2:15 p.m. announcement, ended the day up 73.05 points to close at 7795.38. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained 12/32, or about $3.75 for a $1,000 bond, to close at 98 27/32. The yield fell to 6.71% from 6.73%.</br></br>The Fed's decision to keep interest rates at current levels stems from two recent economic developments. First, numerous signs indicate that economic growth in the second quarter slowed from the red-hot 5.9% pace of the first period. Just yesterday, for example, the Commerce Department reported that factory orders fell 0.7% in May, reversing a 1.4% jump in April.</br></br>The second trend giving comfort to the Fed has been inflation's moderation, despite strong growth earlier in the year and an unemployment rate below 5% -- a level most mainstream economists consider likely to trigger higher wages and prices.
METUCHEN, N.J.--Republican Steve Lonegan and his Democratic opponent for an open U.S. Senate seat, Newark Mayor Cory Booker, took in a similar amount of household income last year, but the sources of their money and the taxes they paid contrasted sharply, documents made available Monday showed.</br></br>The two are running in a special Oct. 16 election to fill the Senate seat held by Frank Lautenberg, who died in June. Mr. Lonegan has made Mr. Booker's financial transparency and earnings a campaign issue, and the Newark Democrat released 15 years of his returns Friday in response. Mr. Lonegan's campaign allowed reporters to view three years of his tax returns Monday.</br></br>Mr. Booker's total income was $509,719 last year, and Mr. Lonegan and his wife's was $515,280, the documents showed.</br></br>Mr. Booker, a nationally known Democrat, has supplemented his mayoral salary with hundreds of thousands of dollars from speaking fees across the country. He made $347,594 in speaking fees last year and brought in a total of more than $1.3 million since 1998.</br></br>Mr. Lonegan's tax returns depicted a modest investor who has swung between profits and losses on a handful of rental properties and stock holdings.
WASHINGTON -- Consumer credit in July continued to grow at a rapid rate, although the pace was slower than in the previous two months, the Federal Reserve Board said.</br></br>Consumer credit increased a seasonally adjusted $7.11 billion in July, the board said, after rising $7.83 billion in June and a record $10.23 billion in May.</br></br>Alan Murray, vice president of Citicorp Information Services, said the July figures show that "consumer demand remains strong," despite other signs that the vigorous economic recovery may be slowing. He said the continued heavy borrowing suggests that consumer spending isn't about to decline precipitously, as some consumer-goods producers had feared.</br></br>Still, Mr. Murray doesn't expect such unusually strong growth in consumer credit to continue. "With increases like these," he said, "sooner or later, the consumer has to run out of gas."</br></br>The Fed report showed that consumer credit grew at a 19.75% annual rate in July, compared with an average annual pace of 24% during the second quarter and 11.5% for all of 1983. Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., said a further slowdown in consumer credit growth would be welcome because it would relieve upward pressure on interest rates.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday said that, the value of the U.S. dollar has declined far enough in the past 18 months to make American industry competitive again in world markets.</br></br>However, Volcker cautioned id testimony before the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee that other economic policy actions must be taken both here and abroad before the swollen U.S. trade deficit can be reduced to acceptable levels.</br></br>Those steps include reducihg consumption in the United States in favor of more investment, beginning with cuts in the federal governmentï¿½Ûªs budget deficit, he said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Tor other countries, some appropriate mix of monetary, fiscal and other policies to sustain and enhance domestic demand are required if their trade surpluses are to decline in a context of healthy world growth,ï¿½Û he continued.</br></br>Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and Volcker have been pressing the Japanese and West German governments to stimulate domestic demand in their countries, and both have been resisting. Last week, Baker said that the alternative would have to be still further depreciation of the dollar, and his remarks temporarily knocked the currency down on foreign exchange markets.</br></br>Volcker, as he has frequently-in the past, warned that "without support of other policies, exchange rate changes can be counterproductive in important respectsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½inflationary in the United States, and a restraint on demand and economic activity abroad.ï¿½Û
MCI Communications Corp. yesterday announced it has won a $150 million contract to provide the trading network for the Nasdaq stock market.</br></br>Under the contract, worth an estimated $150 million over six years, the Washington telecommunications company will install, operate and manage the network that carries all of Nasdaq stock transactions.</br></br>Nasdaq is run by the District-based National Association of Securities Dealers. The trading system allows brokers to buy and sell shares in thousands of companies on a national network of computers instead of going through traditional stock exchanges. The new MCI system will be designed to increase the speed of transactions and the volume of shares the fast-growing system can handle.</br></br>"This is a significant, very future-oriented contract," Barry Wagar, senior vice president for marketing at MCI. The current Nasdaq system was provided by MCI arch-rival AT&T. "It feels real good to us," Wagar said. However, "It's not that much in terms of the bottom Line," said Michael J. Balhoff, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. In Baltimore. He said that $150 million over six years does not add up to much for a company with annual revenue of $10.6 billion. "That's why the stock closed up 25 cents." he added. MCI shares closed at $28.87-1/2 yesterday.</br></br>The contract is a strong "vote of confidence" in MCI, Balhoff said. "Here is a major exchange that requires absolute reliability."
CORPORATIONS are borrowing money at the fastest clip in several years amid a wave of leveraged buyouts and acquisitions, rising capital expenditures and pressure from shareholders for larger dividends and share buybacks.</br></br>The debt is expected to keep rising in the next year -- especially if the Federal Reserve holds off on more interest-rate increases -- as companies raise cash to repurchase more shares and to make higher quarterly and special-dividend payouts. For now, economists say the balance sheets of most companies are strong enough to handle the added borrowing.</br></br>In fact, the moves could help the stock market deal with an expected slowdown in profit gains later this year as the economy contracts. That is because both higher dividends, and buybacks that raise earnings per share by reducing the number of outstanding shares, could help offset any decline in profit growth.</br></br>Nonfinancial companies saw their debt rise 6.3% in the 12 months that ended in the first quarter to $5.5 trillion. That is the fastest yearly growth for debt in five years. In 2005, debt increased at an average 12-month pace of 5.1%, while in 2004 debt growth was 2.7%, according to John Lonski, an economist at Moody's Investors Service. Debt is expected to have increased about 7% in the second quarter.</br></br>The rosy debt scenario is predicated on an economy that doesn't weaken significantly, and on interest rates not climbing much higher, both of which would make the increased debts more of a burden. It all comes at a time when individuals and the U.S. government are dealing with their own heavy borrowing, making it more important for U.S. companies to successfully handle their added debt.
SAN ANTONIO--Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher on Wednesday blamed both major U.S. political parties for a "horrid" political climate in Washington, and said monetary policy alone can't drive the economy.</br></br>"We provided the fuel for economic recovery," Mr. Fisher said of the central bank, describing the Fed's stimulus as "very high-octane, dirt-cheap gasoline."</br></br>But he said that neither Republican nor Democratic politicians in Washington have done their part by putting policies in place that spur the private sector "to take the cheap fuel that we have provided and step on the accelerator."</br></br>He made the comments during a speech at an event in San Antonio, to honor Dick Evans, chairman and chief executive of Cullen/Frost Bankers Inc.</br></br>Mr. Fisher, who isn't a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, has been an outspoken opponent of the Fed's easy-money stance, a fact he noted during his remarks Wednesday. He also reiterated his view that promotion of maximum sustainable job growth--one of the Federal Reserve's legal mandates--isn't possible using monetary stimulus alone.
You can't escape Internet Insanity these days. Scarcely a week passes, it seems, without us reading, hearing or seeing a story about how some company most of us never heard of will make a gazillion dollars from the Internet, the international network that lets computers communicate with one another. The world is full of people buying Internet stocks in search of the next Microsoft Corp. But you don't need to know much about Web browsers or servers or other high-technology stuff to see that it's almost impossible for any of today's Internet stocks to be the next Microsoft.</br></br>It's a question of math, not technology. Even with the sharp drops of the past three trading days, stocks of Internet companies are trading at levels I consider insanely high. If you overpay for the stock of even a very good company, it's almost impossible to make a superior long-term profit. And long-term profit is what we small nonprofessional investors should worry about. You short-term types, find a different article to read.</br></br>The simplest illustration is Netscape Communications Corp., which sold stock in August at $28 a share and currently sells for almost five times as much. Netscape's backers says the company will use its World Wide Web browser technology (which lets you find things on the Internet) to dominate the Internet the way that Microsoft parlayed its operating system technology into domination of large parts of the PC software business. But even if Netscape ends up wildly successful, it's virtually impossible for anyone buying Netscape stock at today's prices to get a Microsoft-like return. Here's why. If you bought 100 shares of Microsoft at its initial public offering in 1986 for $2,100, you now own 1,800 shares worth $158,400 at yesterday's closing price. Call it a 75-to-1 return in just under 10 years.</br></br>Netscape closed yesterday at $130.25 a share. For you to make a 75-to-1 return in less than 10 years, Netscape stock has to rise to almost $9,800 a share by the year-end of 2004. Its 40.8 million shares (including stock under option, as do all the valuations in this article) are valued in the stock market at around $5.3 billion. For you to buy now and make a Microsoft return, Netscape shares have to be worth almost $400 billion in less than 10 years.</br></br>How much is $400 billion? It's more than seven times the current value of all the shares of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. or Microsoft. About 13 Walt Disney Cos. Almost as much as General Electric Co., Exxon Corp., AT&T Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. combined. You don't need a doctorate in higher mathematics to see that's sort of unlikely.
Wall Street's roller coaster week ended on a downturn today amid a "double-witching" expiration of stock futures and options contracts and a jump in interest rates.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks sank 30.45 points to end at 3492.83, as the key index retreated from Thursday's record high close of 3523.28.</br></br>The Dow gained 49.82 points in a wild week that saw record rallies and steep plunges, in part linked to the volatile trading of gold futures. Each rally in precious metals this week was viewed as a virtual confirmation that inflation was back - spooking a stock market that wanted to go higher.</br></br>Gold prices climbed again today, lifting the stocks of gold mining companies. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $3.30 a troy ounce to $377.50.</br></br>The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/16 point, or $5.63 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves inversely from price, rose to 7.04 percent from 6.99 percent late Thursday. It was its highest level in nearly two months.
Author: Lynn Cowan</br></br>The U.S. IPO market is likely to grind to a standstill until broader market indexes settle down amid continuing crises in the Middle East and Japan, with the delayed launch of private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC one early example of sputtering deal flow.</br></br>Unrest in Libya and an escalating nuclear-plant malfunctions in Japan following that country's earthquake last week have weighed on the markets, with global exchanges tumbling Tuesday, including major U.S. indexes. That isn't a welcoming environment for initial public offerings, which are considered a higher-risk security class, say investment bankers and analysts.</br></br>"These deals require a lot of stability," said Ben Holmes, president of IPO research firm Morningnotes.com.</br></br>Apollo Global Management, which had been expected to set its IPO terms such as a price range on Tuesday, instead decided to wait to see if broader markets settle down, according to people close to the deal. IPO terms are usually set a few weeks ahead of a deal's launch, so Apollo was likely aiming to go public in early April.
Mills Corp., the District-based company that owns Potomac Mills and similar factory outlet shopping centers around the country, reported that operating results for the fourth quarter were flat because rising interest rates canceled out higher income from its malls.</br></br>For the year, the company said, operating results were up because rents it charges in its malls rose and because it expanded Potomac Mills.</br></br>Most real estate companies such as Mills report two sets of results -- standard net income and funds from operations, a measure that gauges operating results by removing the accounting effects of items such as depreciation and amortization. Mills, however, did not release standard net income figures in a way that would allow comparisons among its operating periods.</br></br>For calendar 1994, a period that included four months before the company went public, funds from operations on a pro forma basis came to $54.6 million ($1.66 per share), up 7 percent from $51.03 million ($1.55).</br></br>In the fourth quarter, the measure was $14.8 million (45 cents), compared with $14.7 million (45 cents) in the pro forma period a year earlier.

Stocks fell sharply after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, as investors focused on a Fed statement suggesting that the economy will continue to be weak.</br></br>After trading higher for most of the day, market indexes began falling almost immediately after the Fed announcement. The Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 2.66%, or 50.05 points, to 1831.30, its lowest level since March 29. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.41%, or 145.93 points, to 10174.14, its worst level since April 16. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.21%, or 14.15 points, to 1157.26.</br></br>Bonds rose and the dollar fell.</br></br>The stock-market drops, which came even though the Fed's move was in line with Wall Street expectations, reflect a frustration among investors that the current economic slump may be nowhere near a turnaround.</br></br>"It was the most bearish commentary the market could have received, the worst-case scenario," said Bill Schneider, head of stock trading at UBS Warburg. "The market has been grasping at straws for evidence of a recovery," but the Fed was "blunt and pessimistic."

that has produced more tedious, predictable and repetitive musings over the years than the institution of the vice presidency has. But offhand we canï¿½Ûªt think of it. The only good thing to be said about this periodic outburst of interest that invariably manifests itself in disinterment of the same quotations from John Nance Garner and aphorisms and perplexities is that it only happens every four years. But it is our sad duty to inform you that it is that time again. Your four years are up.</br></br>So letï¿½Ûªs get started. What is different about the job that Ronald Reagan offered George Bush last night? What, if anything, has been added to the sum total of human knowledge about the vice presidency in the past four years? In Detroit, much of the external aspect of the thing was unchanged. There were the same craven, sickly, sycophantic bows and smiles on the.part of certain of the aspirants for the job whenever the name of the Great Man, the Incomparable One reposing up there in the heavily guarded top floor suite was mentioned. There was the same continuous shifting of certainty from one hot prospect to another with the same collection of after-the-fact justifications of why the momentï¿½Ûªs favorite would be the candidateï¿½Ûªs choice.</br></br>But some of the most durable pieties of the classic conversation on this subject have been affected by the Carter-Mondale years. Like Cabinet-government, which this administration also gave at least a modified try, and which turned out to be a truly terrible idea, so too the livingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½as distinct from deadï¿½ï¿½ï¿½vice presidency has been experimented with by the Carter government. By living vice presidency, we mean merely the innovation of actually letting the vice president out of his institutional cage, of trying to substitute useful political and governmental work for the more traditional and much-mocked idleness associated with the office.</br></br>All candidates for president, of course, have pledged to try this out, but only Jimmy Carter has given it a real test. It has sort of, more or less, vaguely worked: Mr. Mondale is incomparably more active.</br></br>more heavily engaged in the staff and policy business of his administration than any vice president we can remember. And he has been spared the familiar vice presidential function (not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution, but derived from things that august document does and doesnï¿½Ûªt say about the job) of being systematically and unendurably and endlessly tortured by the president and the presidential staff.
Interest rates rose slightly in the Federal National Mortgage Associationï¿½Ûªs (FNMA) latest auction of $200 million in mortgage purchase commitments.</br></br>The average gross yield to! FNMA Tuesday on $45.6 mil-! lion of three-month commitments; was 9.04 per cent, up from 9.01 per cent in the previous auction two weeks ago.</br></br>The average yield on $117 million of six-month commitments was 8.99 per cent, up from 8.97 per cent while the rate of $37.5 million worth of proposed construction commitments was 8.95 per cent, up [from 8.94 per cent. ,</br></br>FNMA said it would issue commitments for between $200 million and $250 million in mortgage purchases of its next auction scheduled Sept. 22.</br></br>The association, a government-spawned private corporation, purchases FHA and VA backed mortgages at a discount to help stabilize the mortgage markets.
D.C. ambulance worker Frank Fishburne says he's lost count of how many times he's been injured on the job.</br></br>An emergency medical technician for 15 years, Fishburne's first injury came in 1975, when he suffered a herniated disk as he and another ambulance crew member brought a patient down a flight of stairs. Fishburne was in traction for a month.</br></br>Since then, Fishburne, 39, has experienced a raft of injuries while on routine calls. He has injured the nerves in his right hand, forcing him to wear a leather-and-metal brace. Once, he said, a stretcher he was carrying snapped, hurting his back and neck and causing permanent damage to his facial nerves. And last year, his worst back injury yet laid him up for six months.</br></br>As the number of ambulance calls has surged in recent years, so have reports of serious on-the-job injuries suffered by paramedics and emergency medical technicians. The injuries, in turn, have pushed the workers' frustrations up yet another notch and increased the staffing problems of a service that, even when fully staffed, is stretched to its limit.</br></br>Moreover, ambulance employees and officials are concerned that an increasing number of paramedics and technicians are quitting after only a few years of service because they are too physically debilitated to continue.
The Bush administration yesterday stepped up the pressure on China to end restrictions on U.S. imports, releasing a list of $3.9 billion worth of Chinese-made footwear, silks, luggage, electronics and other products that face retaliatory duties here if barriers to American goods remain in China.</br></br>The 44-page list of Chinese imports that face as much as a doubling of their tariffs was released in Washington after negotiations in Beijing ended with little progress on U.S. demands that China open its markets to American goods.</br></br>The Bush administration is insisting that China end what Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael H. Moskow called "a complex web of trade barriers" that keep American products from its markets.</br></br>Among other things, the United States wants China to publish all its laws and regulations on foreign trade, many of which are kept secret, and to eliminate restrictive import bans, quotas and licensing requirements that U.S. officials say have prevented American products from being sold in China.</br></br>This is by far the largest retaliation list the United States has ever published, and although it is likely to be pared down, said Moskow, its final value will be more than $2 billion worth of Chinese goods.
LONDON -- In 1970, when Charles Saatchi was 26, he wanted to build the biggest advertising agency in Britain. Never mind that his 12-person firm was lodged in a tiny office near London's peep-show district. After a few weeks in business, he sent "takeover proposals" to agencies 100 times his size. They snickered.</br></br>Today, however, the marketing world takes Mr. Saatchi seriously.</br></br>Saatchi & Saatchi Co. has grown into Europe's largest ad agency, and a global rival to the top U.S. agencies. Its revenue rose 42% to the current equivalent of $1.03 billion in the year ended Sept. 30. Earnings in the year were up 90% to $11.4 million. Its share price has climbed, too. Even U.S. advertising giants like J. Walter Thompson Inc. are blinking hard. Saatchi & Saatchi "has a voracious appetite" for growth, observes Michael Cooper-Evans, head of J. Walter Thompson's British offices.</br></br>Saatchi & Saatchi's latest moves are causing a stir outside the advertising world as well. In October, the firm agreed to buy Yankelovich Skelly & White, a U.S. market-research group, for $13.5 million. A few weeks later, it snapped up Hay Group, a U.S. management consultant, for at least $80 million. Saatchi & Saatchi says more acquisitions will follow, propelling it into a wide range of business services. (The firm's high stock-market price -- it has been trading at a price-earnings multiple of 21 -- makes it possible to finance acquisitions by issuing stock.)</br></br>The new strategy has touched off controversy. Financial analysts love the plan, and say it will boost Saatchi's earnings. Advertising insiders say it's another sign of Saatchi & Saatchi's obsession with growth. But some clients fret that the expansion is too ambitious, and could blur the agency's traditional focus on advertising.
'I want to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody." That was James Carville, President Clinton's chief political consultant, talking to this newspaper in February 1993.</br></br>When President Clinton backed away from HillaryCare and the rest of his big-government agenda, it wasn't just Democratic losses in the 1994 midterm elections that forced his hand. It was the power of the bond market, a point Mr. Carville understood but Republicans seem to have forgotten.</br></br>If today's Republicans are going to roll back President Obama's massive expansion of government, they will need the muscle of a bond market free from the Federal Reserve's manipulation. History suggests that only the prospect of higher and increasingly painful financing costs chastens committed big spenders. A liberated, and consequently less docile, bond market would not only restrain Washington's profligacy, it would also free the Republican Party to refocus on the big ideas and positive vision that made it a global force in the 1980s.</br></br>No cause unites the Republican Party like the battle for limited government. From Ted Cruz's government shutdown to Paul Ryan's budget compromise with Patty Murray, the political tactics have varied but the goal of limited government has remained the same. The push for limited government even polls well. According to a recent Gallup poll, an overwhelming majority of Republicans, 81%, and a solid majority of Americans, 60%, think the federal government has too much power.</br></br>But despite the public's support and Republicans' herculean efforts, the campaign to pare back government has failed both politically and substantively. The federal government continues to grow while Republicans are increasingly derided for their obsession with spending cuts. Far too many Americans now see the GOP as opposing everything and favoring nothing.
The steep rise in oil prices in recent years has not triggered either high inflation or a recession, in large part because consumers and businesses expect price increases to remain tame, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday.</br></br>That contrasts sharply with the experience of the 1970s, when spiking oil prices combined with expectations of high inflation to fuel double-digit price increases and slower economic growth, he said in a speech to economists at the National Bureau of Economic Research Summer Institute in Cambridge, Mass.</br></br>The Fed chairman made no mention of the central bank's interest rate policy or its forecast for inflation or economic growth in coming months. He is scheduled to testify to Congress on those subjects next week.</br></br>Light sweet crude oil closed yesterday at $72.81 per barrel, up 62 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the latest stop in a choppy climb since 1998, when it was trading for less than $15 a barrel.</br></br>Yet consumer prices rose 2.7 percent in the 12 months ended in May, the Labor Department said. That is higher than the Fed would like but far less than the 13.5 percent inflation in 1980, after the 1979 Iranian revolution sent oil prices soaring.
CORRECTION: The Washington Investing column in the Feb. 11 Business section incorrectly reported the status of Ernst & Young's consulting practice. Ernst & Young sold its global management and information technology consulting practice in May 2000. (Published 2/12/02)</br></br>Last week, the big accounting firms all said that having seen the light of Enron, they will somehow segregate their accounting and consulting operations.</br></br>The consulting conflict is obviously not the only thing that's wrong with corporate accounting, but building a barrier between auditing and consulting or splitting them into separate companies is a good start.</br></br>Cutting apart the two businesses, as the accounting firms well know, will be radical surgery, requiring the companies to fundamentally change the way they manage, operate and market their services.</br></br>The separation anxiety will be greatest at Ernst & Young, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The need for the split was recognized years ago by KPMG and what was then known as Arthur Andersen.
{First of a Series}</br></br>W.J. Turner L. Cobden, a top municipal bond marketer at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., walked away about a year ago. "I'm glad to be away from all the turmoil," he says.</br></br>Now, the 58-year-old Mr. Cobden lives in Rhode Island, where he hopes to open a car-stereo store in a converted garage. It will be run by his son, who lost his own municipal bond job in 1987, when Oppenheimer & Co. trimmed almost one-third of its municipal staff.</br></br>Mr. Cobden's advice to those still in the business: "Make it quick and get out."</br></br>For much of the Roaring Eighties, a profligate Wall Street thumbed its nose at the woes of the Farm Belt, the rust belt and the Southwest's oil patch. But no longer. Eighteen months after the stock market crashed and ended the party, Wall Street is coming to grips with its own painful recession.
In the wee hours one morning a few days ago, when Congress was struggling to reduce the federal deficit, a bunch of millionaire tax dodgers proved that taxes are not as inevitable as death.</br></br>With most of Congress and the media asleep, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski slipped into the tax bill a provision that gives a small group of accused tax cheatersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½most from Ros-tenkowskiï¿½Ûªs home stateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½privileges enjoyed by no other taxpayers.</br></br>The law of this land is that every taxpayer must bear the responsibility of proving the deductions claimed on the annual Form 1040 are legitimate. If the Internal Revenue Service questions the deduction you took for medical expenses, you have to prove you were sick.</br></br>But that rule of law will not apply to some 200 wealthy commodity traders who have been accused by the Internal Revenue Service of perpetrating one of the most costly tax dodges ever discovered.</br></br>For these privileged individuals, there will be a presumption that certain deductions they have claimed are legitimate. Only if the IRS can prove otherwise will the deductions be denied.
PhyCor Inc. and MedPartners Inc. called off their proposed $6.25 billion merger, blaming "significant operational and strategic differences." At the same time, MedPartners said it expects to take two large charges in the fourth quarter and possibly to report a quarterly loss from continuing operations.</br></br>From the beginning, the planned combination of the two large physician management companies -- which stunned Wall Street when it was announced last October -- was greeted with skepticism by the Street. Almost immediately, the stock prices of both companies began to falter as analysts suggested that uniting the disparate cultures would be difficult. Yesterday, PhyCor, Nashville, Tenn., rose 12.5 cents to $26.50 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. MedPartners, Birmingham, Ala., fell 76.5625 cents to $18.1719 in composite Big Board trading. The merger plans were called off after the market closed.</br></br>The merged company, which would have brought together the nation's two largest physician-management companies, would have had affiliations with about 35,000 doctors, or 5% of the country's physicians, and would have generated annual revenue of about $8 billion. Last fall, the companies heralded the deal as a way to put doctors on a level playing field with hospitals and health-maintenance organizations. Cost savings from economies of scale were also expected.</br></br>Nevertheless, the differences proved insurmountable. "Each company takes a much different approach to business in a number of key areas, including information systems, development, and operations," Joseph C. Hutts, PhyCor's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. In an interview, Mr. Hutts said the deal unraveled over about a week's time. He declined to specify the differences that led to the dissolution. He said the two companies agreed not to elaborate beyond the prepared statement.</br></br>"The differences were quite significant," Larry House, MedPartners chairman and CEO, said in an interview. He also declined to elaborate, saying only that the clashes involved the business operations and the corporate cultures.
NEW DELHI--A fund-management giant in its U.S. home market, T. Rowe Price Group Inc. is finding India tough to crack.</br></br>Two years ago, T. Rowe joined a long line of Western financial firms hoping to tap into India's growing wealth and bought a large stake in the country's oldest mutual-fund company.</br></br>But the investment in Mumbai-based UTI Asset Management Co. has been dogged by discord with the Indian partners, slackening in India's mutual-fund industry and slippage of UTI's market share. T. Rowe's woes also underscore the difficulties facing some foreign money managers in the country.</br></br>Though Indian laws allow foreign companies to fully own mutual-fund companies, T. Rowe, like some other foreign rivals, entered India through a joint venture, hoping to eventually increase its ownership. The Baltimore-based company in 2010 teamed up with four government-owned financial groups, which sold T. Rowe an equal portion of their UTI equity for a total of $140 million. The deal made T. Rowe the single-largest holder in UTI, with 26%.</br></br>But that didn't help when UTI's chairman and managing director, U.K. Sinha, left last February to head India's capital markets regulator.
The economic boom of the 1990s raised the incomes of the poorest Americans, held the size of the middle class steady and swelled the ranks of those with six-digit incomes, according to census data released yesterday.</br></br>The figures confirm a long-term momentum that has given millions of Americans significantly more income: since 1980, the share of the U.S. population earning more than $100,000 annually has doubled, after adjusting for inflation. That upward income mobility was so broad that, when the census was taken two years ago, 5 out of 6 Americans lived in counties in which the lowest niches -- those with incomes of less than $15,000 -- were shrinking.</br></br>But there were notable exceptions, places where the middle class shrank while the ranks of the rich and poor expanded. They included a swath of major metropolitan areas from Washington through Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York, as well as large parts of Southern California.</br></br>Poverty may have grown in those areas because of high numbers of immigrants from poor countries, experts say, or in some cases, an ailing local economy.</br></br>"It's a positive picture overall," said John Logan, a sociology professor at the State University of New York in Albany, who compiled his own study of census data for metropolitan areas.
The program selling and profit-taking that stalled the stock market's rally Wednesday turned mean yesterday, sending prices plunging in the afternoon.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 48.24 points at 2026.03 on volume of 197.3 million shares. The volume was down from the 211 million shares that changed hands Wednesday. Declining issues were ahead of gainers, 3 to 1, on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>Broader market indexes also lost ground. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index was off 5.22 to 263.84 and the New York Stock Exchange Index fell 2.56 to 148.92.</br></br>Traders and money managers said investors had been getting increasingly nervous as the stock market failed to extend its gains past the post-crash high of 2074.27 set Tuesday. When gold and oil prices began to rise yesterday morning, investors began retreating from stocks. The exodus gained momentum in the afternoon as stock-index futures reached levels at which they became underpriced in relation to the cash indexes, triggering computerized trading programs in which stocks were sold and futures contracts were bought.</br></br>But the sell-off didn't disturb many market professionals, who argued that the market's recent run-up to a new post-crash high had set the stage for a correction.
Some people continue to believe, or at least still assert, that tax rates don't influence taxpayer behavior all that much. We therefore direct their attention to the Treasury Department's latest historical data on revenues from taxes on capital gains.</br></br>The numbers look like a 25-year demonstration of the Laffer Curve in action. As the nearby chart shows, taxes paid on capital gains have been highly responsive to the maximum capital gains tax rate. (See accompanying table -- WSJ Jan. 24, 2005) Especially notable is how, over the years, capital gains realizations and the taxes paid on those gains have tended to increase in the years following a cut in the capital gains tax rate.</br></br>The reductions highlighted in the chart include the famous William Steiger tax rate cut that passed Congress in late 1978 over Jimmy Carter's objections, the Reagan tax cut passed in 1981, and the cut that was part of the Clinton-Gingrich balanced budget deal of 1997. All of those reductions caused taxpayers to cash in more of their gains and thus yielded revenue windfalls for the federal Treasury in succeeding years.</br></br>On the other hand, the capital gains tax increase of 1986 -- which moved the rate back up to 28% from 20% -- proved to be a revenue disaster. Taxes paid on long-term capital gains (those typically held longer than one year) fell off a cliff to $33.7 billion in 1987 from $52.9 billion a year earlier. And they stayed at close to that mediocre lower level for nearly another decade. In other words, higher rates didn't do anyone any good, not even the politicians who thought they'd be getting more tax revenue to spend.</br></br>We aren't asserting that tax-rate changes have been the only factors influencing revenue changes. The performance of the broader economy and the stock market have also mattered a great deal. Capital gains revenues boomed in the late 1990s after the 1997 rate cut, but they fell abruptly with the bursting of the dot-com and tech bubbles in 2001.
Americaï¿½Ûªs economic recession is worrying Hungarian J Communist leaders, reports I the Communist newspaper Fig-lycloe.</br></br>I ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With a progressing depression our exports to the capitalist countries will encounter considerable difficulties due to tougher competition,ï¿½Û the newspaper said.</br></br>; Hungary and other iron curtain countries are earning badly needed hard currencies through exports to the west. The newspaper continued: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We have to expect the difficulties (in exports) fto draw on and become general in the future. Many capitalist countries will hinder imports by protective customs barriers because of fear of a crisis. Toughening of competition will also occur on the markets of the under-developed countries.ï¿½Û Other news of international trade:</br></br>Japan has assured U.

Believe your banker. Listen to the junior associate at your law firm. And read your newspaper with a skeptical eye.</br></br>These seem to be some lessons of the 2006 Local Economy Challenge. Meet the person who most accurately predicted how the Washington region would fare last year: Kathleen Walsh Carr, the president of Cardinal Bank Washington. And the least accurate? We'll get to that in a minute.</br></br>Carr correctly guessed that the value of goods and services produced in the Washington area would rise by 4 percent. She reckoned that the region would add 70,000 jobs; the number was 67,600. She figured that local stocks would rise 10 percent; they rose 9.3 percent.</br></br>Those were among the nine economic indicators that she predicted, on average, better than any other participant. "I am just stunned that I won," said Carr. "I wasn't throwing darts at a board, but almost."</br></br>Actually, she was being modest. Carr has spent 33 years as a banker, all in her native Washington. She said she based her predictions mostly on conversations with friends and clients, from whom she detected a general feeling of confidence. "It wasn't scientific so much as it was information gleaned from other people," she said. It didn't hurt that, as a member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, she routinely reviews its extensive economic research.
A problem involving rents paid for apartments and houses caused the government to slightly understate the rate of consumer price inflation for the first eight months of the year, officials said yesterday.</br></br>The Bureau of Labor Statistics yesterday revised its monthly figures for the consumer price index to correct the problem, raising the inflation rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 3.5 percent on an annual basis, for the January through August period. The rate for the so-called core portion of the index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was also lifted by the same amount, to 2.7 percent.</br></br>Katharine G. Abraham, commissioner of labor statistics, said at a press briefing the problem first arose in January 1999 when the agency began using a significantly different sample of housing units to collect rent information. However, she said, the CPI figures for 1999 were not revised because the agency decided the changes were too small to warrant all the problems such a revision would cause for everyone who uses the CPI to adjust benefits, pay, rents and even parts of the tax code for inflation.</br></br>"It would be enormously disruptive for the whole gamut of users of this information" if the 1999 figures had been revised, Abraham said, adding that her agency's guidelines for such matters say "we should not be revising too far back in time."</br></br>The agency will not know until next month, when it has the September price figures, whether the changes announced yesterday will affect next year's cost-of-living increases in Social Security payments, veterans' benefits and federal pensions. Those benefits are raised each January according to the increase in the average level of the CPI in the July through September period from the level in the same three months of the preceding year.
A burst of stock buying pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up a record 257.36 points, erasing in just one day nearly half the decline suffered by the Dow last month.</br></br>The Dow closed at 7879.78 in heavy trading. Though the Dow's gain was a record in point terms, the percentage gain of 3.38 percent was well below the record post-World War II gain of 10.1 percent posted Oct. 21, 1987.</br></br>"There was heavy money flowing into the market today," said Richard Cripps, director of equity marketing at Legg Mason Inc., a Baltimore brokerage firm.</br></br>Today's market surge confounded the fears of bearish investors who worried that the big, multinational companies that make up the Dow average -- which has doubled in the past three years -- were finally due for a significant fall. The average had lost 7.71 percent of its value since its peak on Aug. 6 at 8259.31.</br></br>But analysts said it was too soon to say if today's action signaled the beginning of a new leg up for the bull market. Rather, several analysts expect big-company stocks to hover in a narrow trading range, at least until economists get a better fix on whether Federal Reserve Board policymakers will decide to raise short-term interest rates when they meet on Sept. 30.
strong gains, the stock market turned lower today and appeared headed for a belated consolidation period.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Whatï¿½Ûªs unusual, actually, is that the market didnï¿½Ûªt consolidate earlier,ï¿½Û observed Monte Gordon, analyst for Bache & Co.</br></br>He added that the market appeared to be counting on a strong first quarter but could lose some of its upward thrust on any statement - that- the economy would not be powerful in the first quarter of 1971.</br></br>Some brokers also- said it was a good sign that volume had fallen off a bit with.the decline in prices. . i The Dow Jones average:., of 30 industrials closed down 2.74 at 823.18.</br></br>Declines outnumbered advances by 886 to 493 among the 1,685 issues traded on the Big Board as volume dropped to 13.81 million shares from Fridayï¿½Ûªs turnover of 15.8 million shares.	=
The Nasdaq Stock Market, the nation's second-largest stock market after the New York Stock Exchange in market capitalization, expects to start allowing all of its stocks to be traded in 1/16-point increments starting Monday.</br></br>The change, while expected, is a milestone in the evolution of the markets -- and may, at least theoretically, lead to better prices for small investors.</br></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission's market-regulation division Tuesday evening approved the rule proposal, which Nasdaq submitted to the federal regulator April 10. The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, has so far steadfastly stuck to quoting in 1/8-point increments, though many market observers expect that will have to change once its competitors switch to sixteenths.</br></br>Currently, when Nasdaq dealers move their stock prices up or down, they change them in minimum "ticks" of 1/8 of a point, or 12.5 cents at a time. Thus far, only quotes for stocks that are priced at $10 or under are moved up or down in smaller increments, some as low as 1/32, or 3.125 cents.</br></br>Lowering the tick size for all Nasdaq stocks to 1/16 of a dollar, or 6.25 cents a share, could improve prices for individuals who will have the chance to buy for less or sell for more when investing in Nasdaq stocks -- from the market's giants like Intel and Microsoft, to the thousands of tiny stocks on the market. The reason is that "spreads" between the best possible price at which an investor can buy a stock and the price at which they can sell are likely to shrink.
FACTORY ORDERS fell 1.4% in June to an adjusted $191.03 billion as construction spending declined 0.2% to a $310.6 billion rate.</br></br>The stock market posted its biggest gain of the summer in response to the government data, which could indicate some moderation in the economy's rapid growth. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 19.33, at 1134.61, on volume of 127,520,000 shares. Bonds also rallied on the news but later lost much of the gain. Precious metals futures soared.</br></br>---</br></br>Consumers Power requested a $7.07 billion rate rise to cover $3.5 billion in costs from its abandoned Midland, Mich., nuclear plant and to gain "a return on the investment." It also cut its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share from 35 cents.</br></br>---
Even with massive efforts to prop up the economy and banking system, the stock market is facing significant head winds that may persist through much of 2009. That means remaining cautious with your investments for many months to come until it becomes clearer whether these steps will bear fruit.</br></br>It's now been nearly two years since the collapse of the real-estate bubble began. But it was only late last year that the real impact began to be felt by consumers.</br></br>In previous downturns, consumers mostly kept spending, thanks in large part to easily available credit from banks and credit-card companies.</br></br>Meanwhile, in recent decades the already dominant role of the consumer in the U.S. economy became even larger. By the end of last year, consumer spending accounted for 70.4% of U.S. gross domestic product, up from around 63% in the late 1970s. In recent years, the savings rate in the U.S. turned negative, meaning consumers were spending more than they made.</br></br>But that lending has been choked off, and jobs have vaporized, sending the unemployment rate to its highest in 16 years. Consumers have responded by pulling back on their spending.
Sen. John Edwards, who has had perfect rhetorical pitch in this year's presidential campaign, altered the opening of his stump speech this week. The change is a warning to free-traders: Guys, you'd better wake up. There's rebellion in the country, a justified revolt by workers who cannot understand why the economic recovery has produced so few new jobs.</br></br>Edwards told the tale of a father coming home from his factory job to put his daughter to bed. "He knows his night is over when he gives her a hug," Edwards said, speaking in Milwaukee Tuesday. "But tonight . . . he'll be coming home to tell her that his factory is closing, that he's about to lose his job."</br></br>It's worth hearing Edwards to understand the power of this issue. He's not telling an economic story. He's offering a morality tale about a decent American hammered by the system. "It's not because he's done anything wrong," Edwards said. "He's done what he's supposed to do, he's been responsible, he's worked hard, he's raised his family."</br></br>Nor is the factory closing because the company decided to stop making its product. "The problem is they're going to make it somewhere else," Edwards says. "They're going to make it somewhere outside of his community, outside of his country."</br></br>Why? "They only care about profits, they have lobbyists everywhere and they own this White House." The people in charge, he says, "don't hear the other America. They don't see the face of this father who had to come home and tell his little girl that he no longer had a job."
The federal government posted a rare surplus of $16.09 billion last month, primarily because Social Security checks for January were mailed early, the Treasury Department said yesterday.</br></br>The January surplus, the first since September, occurred because Social Security checks, which normally go out on the third day of the month, were mailed Dec. 31 because of New Year's holiday. The early payment inflated spending in December and lowered spending in January.</br></br>For the first four months of the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, the monthly deficits have totaled $65.81 billion, down 0.7 percent from the same period in the 1987 fiscal year.</br></br>For all of 1988, the Reagan administration is projecting that the budget deficit will fall to $146.74 billion, down 2.5 percent from last year's deficit of $150.4 billion.</br></br>However, the Congressional Budget Office, using less optimistic assumptions about economic growth this year, projects a 1988 deficit of $157 billion, well above the target of $144 billion set in the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
The country's meager job growth in the first half will continue at an even slower pace for the rest of year as more companies cut staff, the Conference Board predicts.</br></br>The pressure to contain costs is prevalent despite recent signs that the worldwide economy is picking up, Gail Fosler, the board's chief economist said at a news conference.</br></br>"The leading indicators suggest an upturn in Japan and an incipient upturn in Europe, except for Germany," she said. But because international competition will remain intense amid weak demand, she said, virtually all U.S. industries will remain under price pressure.</br></br>The positive effect of that pressure is that a rise in short-term interest rates isn't likely over the next 12 months, and longterm rates could decline further, she added. Moreover, her reading of economic figures and anecdotal evidence from corporate members of the Conference Board indicate that "the talk about an increase in inflation is absolutely crazy."</br></br>The spate of recent job cut announcements also suggests that business executives are not expecting robust growth. In June, big companies announced 38,669 layoffs, compared with 14,086 in May, according to the Challenger Employment Report, which tracks corporate announcements. And for the first two weeks of July, ISI Group, an economic consulting firm, counted 23 layoff announcements, more than twice as many as a year earlier.
The U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed yesterday as the foreign-exchange market awaited a number of American economic indicators -- including money supply, inflation and retail sales -- that may determine the currency's course in future days.</br></br>Gold declined $1 an ounce in reaction to the still-strong dollar and trader speculation about weakening oil prices.</br></br>Paul Steinborn, an assistant vice president of Credit Suisse, New York, said, "The foreign-exchange market is long (bought) on dollars, and people are nervous about it. There are a lot of players on the sidelines waiting for (today's) economic data."</br></br>The foreign-exchange market, he added, fully expects those figures to present an optimistic view of the U.S. economic recovery, "and the only surprise would be if the economic numbers are on the down side."</br></br>Bruce Pflaum, an assistant vice president and principal dealer of First National Bank of Chicago, agreed that "if (today's economic data) is on the down side, that could pull the dollar down somewhat." He said that New York entered the market yesterday with the dollar strong, "but the dollar failed to set a new high, with the result that the market felt this was a good signal to sell dollars, so the dollar fell back during the course of the day. But it strengthened again in the afternoon in expectation that (today's economic data) will be good."
High concentration of economic power in the food industry, leading to excess profits, Is the main cause of inflation, according to a paper presented yesterday at the Agriculture and Food Economy Summit Conference in Chicago.</br></br>A coalition, of consumer specialists claims that such concentration is the result of the inability of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½weak individual consumersï¿½Û to compete on an equal basis with ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½strong corporate producers.ï¿½Û</br></br>The specialists subscribe to the economic theory that competitive industries are forced to reduce their prices when, aggregate demand drops "while non-competitive industries, protecting their profit margins, raise prices.</br></br>But these decreases were not passed ,on, Mueller says. During the same period, processed food and feed rose 3.4 per cent, and consumer food prices were up 4.4	per cent. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Processors and retailers,ï¿½Û Mueller says, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½have been able to maintain or increase their margins.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½During the six-month period, profits of large grocery manufacturers increased over their already substantial 1973 profits.ï¿½Û
Wholesale pikes held steady last month, the Labor Department reported yesterday, easing fears about inflation and lessening the likelihood that the Federal Resave would boost interest rates to fight it.</br></br>The report, combined with another showing consumer spending increasing less than expected in May, sent interest rates on bonds down and stock prices up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.29 to 3505.01 in moderate trading.</br></br>It was the first time since December that the overall producer price index failed to rise, and a sharp drop from the 0.6 percent increase reported for April, the biggest one-month gain in 2& years. Many economists had expected an increase in wholesale prices, and greeted yesterdayï¿½Ûªs numbers with reM.</br></br>"This is certainly a good sign that we have an uptick" in die economy, Laura Dï¿½ÛªAndrea Tyson, chairman of the presidentï¿½Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers, told reporters yesterday. "There's nothing in the fundamental [economic indicators] that would be evidence for sustained growth in the inflation rate."</br></br>Brace Steinberg, manager of micro-economic analysis at Merrill Lynch-& Co., called the unchanged price index ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½extremely constructive." Since May 1992 the core PPI, winch excludes food and energy, has gone up only L7 percent Sternberg said that is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½as low as weï¿½Ûªve seen wholesale inflation in a quarter-century.ï¿½Û
Your May 3 editorial ("Minimum Wage, Maximum Cover-Up") concerning the Congressional Budget Office study on the impact of a minimum-wage hike was right on the target. It is sad that the House Democratic leadership saw fit to suppress the numbers because they showed the devastating direct impact of a higher wage on jobs and inflation.</br></br>Another issue the backers of a raise choose to ignore is the "ripple effect" of a higher minimum wage. If the lowest salary in a company is increased, those earning more will seek a higher paycheck to maintain basic salary differentials. This would be equally as damaging to the economy as the direct costs.</br></br>A soon-to-be-published University of Chicago study concludes that when this ripple effect is taken into account, the additional cost to American business of a $5.05 minimum wage would be $60 billion a year. Only about half of this would come directly from raising the pay for minimum-wage jobs.</br></br>It is obvious this would have a major impact on all aspects of our economy, ranging from consumer prices and overall inflation to international competitiveness and unemployment rates. This is truly the hidden cost of a minimum-wage increase.</br></br>Robert L. Martin
Congressional Democrats, ignoring a veto threat from President Reagan, bowed yesterday to organized labor and said they will include a controversial plant-closing notification measure in a landmark trade bill.</br></br>The decision by House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Tex.) and Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) to stand by the plant-closing measure is likely to doom the trade legislation even as the nation's trade deficit worsens. Capitol Hill head counters doubt that the Democrats can muster the two-thirds majority in both houses needed to override a veto, especially since major business organizations have said they will support the president in a veto involving plant closing notification.</br></br>But a bruising political battle between the White House and congressional Democrats could also doom Reagan's own top priority in the legislation, a free trade agreement with Canada that needs congressional ratification.</br></br>Wright and Byrd acted just hours after they had held an inconclusive meeting with Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III and White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr., during which it was expected that the congressional leaders would offer to drop the plant-closing measure in return for assurances that the president would sign the trade bill. But both sides said no offers were made. Furthermore, administration sources said neither James nor Howard Baker was prepared to give the assurances the congressional Democrats would have needed to seal a deal.</br></br>In explaining their decision to stand firm on the plant-closing measure, the congressional leaders said they acted after gauging reaction to yesterday's "trade figures and the resulting plunge in the stock market." But the two leaders are also facing intense pressure from organized labor, whose representatives said they would not support trade legislation that did not contain the plant-closing notification measure.
CHICAGO -- An improving job market is prompting Mitt Romney to scrap his emphasis on the unemployment rate and to focus on rising gas prices and government regulation as evidence that President Barack Obama has mismanaged the economy.</br></br>"With the economy looking like it's getting a little better on the employment front, gasoline's getting a lot worse," Mr. Romney told a crowd at a town-hall meeting Sunday in Vernon Hills, Ill.</br></br>At the University of Chicago on Monday, Mr. Romney argued that government regulation under Mr. Obama threatens to strangle ground-breaking ideas and would have stopped the work of Thomas Edison and the Wright brothers.</br></br>Mr. Romney has built his campaign on the premise he is better-equipped than Mr. Obama or any of the other Republicans seeking the presidential nomination to reinvigorate the economy.</br></br>The new approach in Mr. Romney's attacks came on the cusp of a primary election on Tuesday in Illinois that has the potential to boost his lead over other GOP candidates in the delegate count. The few polls conducted recently show Mr. Romney leading his closest rival, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, by between four and 15 percentage points. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul have campaigned little in the state and trail in opinion surveys.
The dollar's continued rapid descent buoyed spirits in commodity and other futures trading pits around the country, igniting sharp price rallies in gold, stock-index and foreign-currency futures and contributing to grain and sugar futures rallies.</br></br>Gold prices rose almost $7 to nearly $420 an ounce. Stock-index futures tracked the stock market's surge, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained more than 22 points. Sugar prices spurted 3/8 cent a pound at one point and some soybean futures prices closed nearly four cents a bushel higher.</br></br>"With the dollar crashing, there's a new fear that there will be a rush back to gold once again," said Scott Mondry, bullion trader at Republic National Bank of New York. Added William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., "Gold traded tick for tick with the currencies the entire day."</br></br>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold contracts for February delivery surged $6.90 an ounce to $419.20 on heavy volume. Silver futures prices on the Comex rose 5.5 cents an ounce to $5.64. Meanwhile, platinum contracts for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose $6.30 to $537 an ounce.</br></br>"Currency euphoria was the sole propellant," said a gold trader in New York.
One of the signature loans of the housing boom--the adjustable-rate mortgage--is looking more attractive than it has in years. For some buyers, it may be an even better deal than a fixed-rate mortgage.</br></br>ARMs typically offer buyers a lower rate for a set period of years, after which rates rise or drop each year, depending on prevailing interest rates. The loans lost favor during the financial crisis, when their rates weren't much better than those for fixed-rate mortgages.</br></br>But now, as interest rates hover near historic lows, the "spread" between the rates on the most popular adjustable and fixed-rate loans is on pace to be the widest it has been in eight years, according to HSH Associates, which tracks mortgage rates.</br></br>For an ARM to make sense, a borrower has to be comfortable taking a gamble that interest rates won't rise, or that he can sell the house before they do. It is a dicey bet now: Rates have been mostly on a downward slide for the past three years, mirroring the recent plunge in 10-year Treasury rates, and seem to be about as low as they are going to get. Many economists are predicting rates will rise in coming years.</br></br>That is why ARMs make sense mostly for borrowers who expect to be in a home for a short time. "If the household is truly intending to stay only for five years, they should take the five-year ARM," says Stuart Gabriel, director of the Ziman Center for Real Estate at the University of California, Los Angeles.
International Business Machines Corp. gave details about sharp cutbacks in New York's Hudson Valley, edging closer to making layoffs in an area that was the cradle of its modern-day business.</br></br>As part of its plan to cut 25,000 workers this year, IBM said 3,000 to 3,500 employees would leave three of the company's New York plants -- East Fishkill, Poughkeepsie and Kingston -- at the end of the current quarter. Together, the plants currently employ about 21,500 workers.</br></br>IBM said it hopes it can keep alive its hallowed "full employment" tradition by achieving all the cuts through voluntary incentive programs available until March 5. But Big Blue signaled that this is an unlikely outcome, and said its first layoffs in a half-century could come in East Fishkill during the second quarter.</br></br>The news had been expected. All three facilities are closely associated with IBM's mainframe-computer operation, which was targeted for the company's harshest cuts: East Fishkill supplies the chips that serve as "brains" for mainframes, while Poughkeepsie and Kingston develop and make the bulky machines.</br></br>East Fishkill will take the brunt of the latest cutbacks, possibly losing as many as 2,500 of its 9,200 workers, an IBM spokeswoman said.
OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product rose 3.8% in 1997, led by strong exports to the U.S. and a big increase in business spending on machinery and equipment, said Statistics Canada, a government agency.</br></br>Last year was the sixth consecutive year to show a rise in Canada's GDP, the total value of the nation's output of goods and services. The 1997 result almost matched last year's U.S. GDP growth of 3.9%.</br></br>Canada's robust expansion is expected to continue. In a recent survey of economists, the average forecast was for 3.5% Canadian GDP growth in 1998 and 2.9% in 1999.</br></br>Prime Minister Jean Chretien, in a speech yesterday, said "low interest rates, improved consumer and business confidence and booming exports have revived the Canadian economy." He also hailed a federal budget projection that in the current fiscal year ending March 31, the Canadian government will show its first balanced budget in almost 30 years. Mr. Chretien is expected to underscore his country's fiscal and economic achievements in a luncheon speech today to the Economic Club of New York.</br></br>Canada's latest economic indicators were well received on financial markets. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-share composite index closed up 20.61 points, or 0.3%, at 7113.10 yesterday. The Canadian dollar rose to 70.51 U.S. cents from 70.23 U.S. cents Friday.
STOCKHOLM--Sweden's central bank cut its main interest rate to zero after similar attempts to boost inflation by central banks in the U.S., Japan and other parts of Europe, prompting the Swedish krona to sink to a four-year low against the euro and dollar.</br></br>The surprise move by the Riksbank on Tuesday underscores the challenge for smaller neighbors of the eurozone in grappling with weak inflation. The European Central Bank's moves to bolster anemic prices in the currency bloc have caused currencies such as the krona to strengthen against the euro, which in turn, has weighed on import prices in Sweden and elsewhere in the region.</br></br>With interest rates now at zero, some analysts think the Riksbank may eventually have to opt for more aggressive monetary policy tools--including a Swiss-style currency floor--to weaken the krona and bolster price growth.</br></br>The Riksbank lowered its main repurchase, or repo, rate from the previous level of 0.25%. The cut was larger than expected, with analysts polled by The Wall Street Journal forecasting a reduction to 0.05%.</br></br>Sweden last cut borrowing costs in July in a bid to boost inflation, which has been stuck around zero for most of this year--well below the 2% inflation target set for the central bank by lawmakers.
Mobil Corp. said yesterday that its profit was virtually flat in 1991, a year that began with spiraling oil prices and ended in a persistent recession,</br></br>Mobil Corp. said yesterday that its profit was virtually flat in 1991, a year that began with spiraling oil prices and ended in a persistent recession, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It was a tough year for our industry, as a worldwide slowdown in economic growth dampened demand for energy and chemical products," Allen E. Murray, chairman of the Fairfax-based oil giant, said in a prepared statement. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Unfortunately, 1992 is not off to a good start. There has been no improvement in business conditions.ï¿½Û</br></br>Like other major oil companies, Mobil was whipsawed last year by oil price gyrations caused by the Persian Gulf War. As the year began, it was enjoying the benefits of high crude oil prices caused by the tensions in the Middle East, but once the war began, prices sank, eliminating that advantage. The company then found itself coping with recession-related slowdowns in oil, gas and chemical product purchases.</br></br>Mobil earned $1.9 billion ($4.65 per share) in 1991, virtually the same as its profit in 1990, when a slightly higher number of shares outstanding .left per-share earnings at $4.60. Revenue fell 3 percent, to $62.7 billion from $64.5 billion in 1990. Nevertheless, Mobil remains by far the largest corporation based in the Washington area.</br></br>In the fourth quarter, Mobil earned $401 million (97 cents), a 39 percent drop from $652 million ($1.58) in 1990 that reflects the change in oil prices and economic conditions. Revenue in the quarter dropped 14 percent, to $16.6 million from $19.4 million in 1990.
Wholesale prices edged up only 0.2 percent during April as a drop in vegetable prices helped offset an increase in the cost of gasoline, the Labor Department said yesterday.</br></br>The Labor Departmentï¿½Ûªs producer price index, which measures prices before they reach the consumer, suggested that inflation will continue to slow down this year, analysts said.</br></br>Including Aprilï¿½Ûªs tiny increase, wholesale prices are rising at a modest annual rate of 1 percent. It was the fourth consecutive month of modest price increases at the wholesale level.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This is a very positive report on inflation,ï¿½Û said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., an economic and investment advisory firm. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It not only showed low inflation, it showed low inflation anyway itï¿½Ûªs sliced.ï¿½Û Price increases were low across the board, with the exception of tobacco.</br></br>Consumer prices, however, have been rising at a much faster rate, and analysts, policy makers and business managers will be watching the consumer price index due out today. In the first three months of the year, the CPI rose at an annual rate of 3.5 per-
The economy is looking a lot better than it did late last year, and a recession is nowhere in sight. Among analysts and businessmen, however, the joy is somewhat restrained.</br></br>One reason is that the economic statistics continue to be good but not great. The widely watched purchasing managers' index, to be reported tomorrow, is expected to decline slightly. A general forecast is that the index, which measures inventories, orders, employment and other factors at manufacturing companies, will be about 48.5% for April.</br></br>While that will be above the average for the past nine months, it will still be below the 50% level above which the economy is judged to be expanding.</br></br>Along the same line, personal income for March, to be reported this morning, is generally expected to rise by only 0.5%, down from a gain of 0.9% in February. According to the economists at Morgan Stanley & Co., "A moderation in income generation largely reflects a slower expansion of the key wage earnings component -- driven by March's temporary consolidation of employment growth."</br></br>Payroll employment expanded by only 26,000 in March, a sharp decrease from prior months. The April number will be released Friday, and analysts believe it bounced upward. But the gain won't be as great as it may at first glance appear. A general estimate is that payroll employment rose by about 300,000 last month, but this included 200,000 temporary census workers. The economists at C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell note that the gain, deducting the census workers, "would be a modest 100,000 as suggested by the decline in the help-wanted ad index and the increase in unemployment claims."
THE TEXTBOOK says that when a country runs a large foreign deficit, its currency will fall. That discourages imports, boosts exports and brings the foreign accounts back into balanceï¿½ï¿½ï¿½all very neatly and rationally. So why is the dollar riding high? Last Friday, the United States announced its third unprecedentedly large monthly trade deficit in a row, and the dollar has been rising cheerily ever since.</br></br>This phenomenonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Mystery of the Buoyant Dollarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½-deserves the attention of more than the writers of textbooks. The exchange rates affect the way the whole economy works, starting with the inflation and employment rates. Thereï¿½Ûªs an explanation of the current mystery, but itï¿½Ûªs not entirely reassuring.</br></br>The deficits in this countryï¿½Ûªs international current account began to get spectacularly large last summer, but there was no impact on the dollar. It was kept up by the extraordinary flow of foreign money into this country. When this country runs a big foreign deficit, Americans normally have to sell dollars to buy the yen, deutsche marks, pounds and so forth to pay their creditors abroad. Itï¿½Ûªs the process of selling the dollars that drives the price down. But over the past year a lot of those foreigners decided that theyï¿½Ûªd rather leave their money here, in dollars. That made the dollar exchange rate immune to the current account deficit.</br></br>a point at which businesses and investors abroad decide that they have accumulated enough dollars, and they begin to move into other currencies. That started to happen in January, and with slow dignity the dollar started to walk down the stairs. Then, in March, it unexpectedly turned around and walked back up. At one time this week it was higher against the British pound than it has ever been.</br></br>The turnaround was caused by the rise in the American interest rates. A borrowing boom is under way in this country, and interest moved up a notch in March. It is genuinely astonishing to see the amounts of money that move from one countryï¿½Ûªs banking system into anotherï¿½Ûªs with even rather small changes in interest rates.
One of Virginia's largest banks has reacted to criticism of it by the Federal Reserve--for allegedly discriminating against some customers--by deciding to apply for a new charter that would remove it from the Fed's oversight.</br></br>Carroll L. Saine, chairman of the board of Richmond-based Central Fidelity Banks Inc., delivered a banker's version of a broadside against the Fed at yesterday's annual shareholders meeting.</br></br>Saine said the bank would seek to replace its current state charter with a national one, under which it would be regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency rather than by the Fed.</br></br>Central Fidelity's unusual action comes in response to a report issued confidentially to the bank last month in which the Fed gave the bank a less-than-satisfactory rating on meeting community credit needs. The report, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post, contends that the bank discriminated in lending on the basis of age and marital status, and defined certain neighborhoods served by its offices in a way that excluded neighboring low-and moderate-income areas.</br></br>"In my opinion, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency--while harsh in their examinations--is logical, objective, basically nonpolitical and more fairly represents the high standards of our bank, its stockholders, customers and employees," Saine told the annual meeting in Richmond.
Author: Tess Stynes</br></br>Alberto-Culver Co., which is about to be absorbed by Unilever PLC, said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings rose 31%. The maker of hair-care and personal-care products saw improved sales.</br></br>The company--whose brands include TRESemme, Alberto VO5, Nexxus and St. Ives--said revenue increased 12% to $431.9 million. On an organic basis, which excludes currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4.9%.</br></br>For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Alberto-Culver reported a profit of $41.3 million, or 41 cents a share, up from $31.7 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring impacts, earnings from continuing operations climbed to 46 cents a share from 33 cents a share.</br></br>Unilever previously agreed to pay $3.7 billion to buy Alberto-Culver in a deal that will vault the consumer-products giant to a more powerful position in the U.S. beauty industry. Most household products companies--fighting a consumer spending slump in the developed world--are trying to use their scale to give them an edge.
The U.S. Postal Service is reeling from the effects of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the ongoing anthrax scare, with declining mail use and rising costs threatening the financial viability of the venerable institution, according to analysts.</br></br>Mail volume was down 5 percent in September over the same period last year. Revenue in the first three weeks after the attacks was as much as $500 million below forecast. Costs associated with damage to a post office near the World Trade Center are at $63 million and mounting.</br></br>Postal Service officials express faith that the institution will recover, but others say the government-created monopoly is spending money it can ill-afford to increase security, combat the anthrax threat and ensure safe and timely mail delivery. No one knows how much the fear of anthrax-tainted mail will lead to further declines in volume.</br></br>"It's unprecedented," Postal Rate Commission analyst Robert Cohen said. "This was a direct attack using the mail as a weapon. It is making everybody rethink the role of the Postal Service. The rate payer will wind up paying a lot more money for this. What's likely to happen is the debt will keep growing and growing, and, ultimately, it could be up to Congress to bail them out."</br></br>Even before Sept. 11, the Postal Service was expecting a $1.65 billion deficit for fiscal 2001. It had announced it would seek its third rate hike in less than a year. It had cut 21,000 positions. It was $11 billion in debt, fast approaching the $15 billion ceiling set by Congress. It froze most capital projects. Its premier product, Priority Mail, was declining after years of exponential growth.
Private investment is pouring into developing countries at the fastest rate since just before the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, according to a report released yesterday by the leading international association of financial institutions.</br></br>The trend has some of the features of a "bubble" that could lead to market turmoil in the future, the group's director acknowledged.</br></br>The Institute of International Finance Inc., which represents more than 300 banks, investment firms and other major financial companies, said the flow of private money to 29 "emerging market" nations reached $279 billion last year. That is more than double the 2002 level, and close to the $287 billion posted in 1997, the year that Thailand's currency collapsed, sparking a flight of capital from Asia. The record was in 1996, when $322 billion flowed into emerging markets.</br></br>The flow of capital has been especially strong in recent months to China and Russia, but was also up last year in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia and the Pacific, and Africa and the Middle East.</br></br>The pace will continue this year, according to the group's forecast. Net flows of private capital -- the amount of new private investment and loans less outflows and repayments -- will be $276 billion in 2005, the institute predicted.
Consumers burdened with debt have probably heard the pitch more than once: By combining some or all of your debt into one big loan, you can lower your monthly payments and be on Easy Street within months.</br></br>Such appeals are rampant these days as rising interest rates squeeze borrowers' wallets. Unfortunately, the outcome is often less cheery than the advertisements imply. While consolidation can indeed lower your monthly payments, it's frequently a faster road to bankruptcy than to financial salvation, many debt specialists say.</br></br>The problem: Consolidation loans feed on the temptations that land many consumers in debt in the first place. You feel as if you can afford another shopping spree once monthly payments are lower.</br></br>Consumers with severe debt problems and poor credit also tend to get socked with extra fees and higher interest rates when they consolidate, making the loan even harder to pay off. "Unfortunately, it's much easier to get a consolidation loan with decent terms when you don't really need it," says Gerri Detweiler, a consumer debt specialist in Sarasota, Fla.</br></br>Also, cutting your monthly payments by stretching out the term of your loan means you will pay far more interest in total.
TOKYO -- Japan's economy is in the midst of a long winter, and spring isn't yet in sight.</br></br>In the past two years, Japan has experienced the shocks of a stock market collapse, export contraction, plummeting corporate profits, credit crunch, and toppling of a political order. Regardless, worse is yet to come as Japan flounders halfway between a managed or market economy, between a rigged or open political system. There's no going back to the pretenses and protectionism of the past, yet there is great pain -- low growth and high unemployment -- in moving toward a more open economic and political system.</br></br>To make matters worse, the Clinton administration has chosen this of all moments to launch a frontal assault on Japan's trade practices. More important than the poor timing is the fact that the get-tough policy is short-sighted for America. Hopes for sustained global growth, and thus expanding U.S. exports, are dependent on hitching Japan's economic engine to our own. The most effective spur to nascent U.S. recovery would be growth in Japan. Yet most predictions put annual growth in gross domestic product this year at well under 1%, compared with 3% for the U.S.</br></br>At the core of Japan's economic problem lie national and corporate noncompetitiveness. The combination of an unrealistically strong yen, a padded work force and years of export-at-all-cost corporate strategies has left Japanese companies with big losses and their bankers holding big debts. For the first time, Japanese companies can't export their way out of these difficulties because the high yen makes their products uncompetitive overseas.</br></br>Japanese banks, with their own assets severely reduced by the 1992 market collapse, lack the ability or inclination to bail out Japanese companies. Japanese consumers, meanwhile, can't be counted on to rescue corporate Japan by buying overpriced Japanese goods. Despite these realities, Japan has yet to taste the bitter medicine America has taken since the end of the '80s -- corporate downsizing and restructuring, layoffs and rising unemployment, economic pain at home for economic competitiveness abroad.
NEW YORK--The options market was alive with "put" sellers Monday, as traders bet shares of Home Depot Inc. and Norfolk Southern Corp. can each hold strong 2011 gains into early next year.</br></br>Options sellers drove unusually heavy activity in both stocks Monday. In each case, large, single trades accounted for the bulk of the session's volume. In Home Depot's options, a trader sold a large batch of January $39 put options to establish a new position. At the same time, the trader unwound an equal number of January $30 puts, ratcheting up the wager.</br></br>The trader, who sold January $39 puts for 53 cents apiece, collected about $1.1 million from the transaction. That money can be kept should Home Depot's shares maintain their recent gains and close above $39 when the options expire in the middle of January. Home Depot's stock fell 22 cents, or 0.5%, to close Monday at $40.20.</br></br>Puts convey the right to sell the underlying stock for a set price by a fixed expiration. Buyers of puts generally profit from stock declines. Put sellers, on the other hand, pocket premiums should the stock expire above the strike price. At the same time, put sellers could be on the hook to purchase stock if the price declines below the exercise price.</br></br>"Basically, the trader is making a bet on the overall economy," said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe Kinahan. Mr. Kinahan noted this week is full of November housing data that could provide some short-term fuel for Home Depot's stock. November readings on U.S. housing starts and building permits are due Tuesday, while existing-home sales data are scheduled for a Wednesday release.
Paris -- AFTER A GOOD RUN on European stocks, it may be time for investors to go Stateside.</br></br>Since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in mid-2004 -- and especially this year -- European stock markets have outperformed the U.S. by a wide margin. But with the Fed nearing the end of its policy of monetary restraint and the European Central Bank about to start raising rates, probably as early as today, it could be Wall Street's chance to shine.</br></br>Contending the ECB is as determined as the Fed to push interest rates to levels it thinks are right to damp inflation, Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin Securities, says this resolve "could inhibit euro-zone equity-market performance just as Fed policy has hampered Wall Street." European stocks, he adds, "could be in for a period of underperformance, while the U.S. stock market makes up for some lost time."</br></br>For the year to date, the Dow Jones Stoxx index of 600 leading European companies is up 19.3%. That compares with a measly 0.2% advance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and a 3.1% increase in the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.</br></br>Behind the performance disparity is a Fed that in the past 17 months has steadily raised rates to 4% from 1%. Meanwhile, the ECB has left its key refinancing rate unchanged at 2% for 29 months and hasn't increased it in more than five years. In fact, since global stock markets bottomed on March 12, 2003, European equities -- on a total- return basis, which includes dividends reinvested -- have outperformed Wall Street by 56%, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International.
Since Sept. 21, the Nasdaq composite index has roared back 34 percent and the Dow Jones industrial average is up 20 percent, nearly to 10,000, where it had not been since August.</br></br>Is the market anticipating an economic rally next year? Is the country more confident because of military success in Afghanistan? Can this stock market recovery last?</br></br>The different answers come from three camps: bull, bear and a third group that wonders why the questions are being asked at all.</br></br>Since the Sept. 11 attacks made the whole world, including the stock market, riskier, some think that valuing stocks at their pre- attack levels is unjustified.</br></br>"For now, the market has moved too far, too fast," said Alan Ackerman, chief investment strategist at Fahnestock and Co. "A contraction in the market now would be neither unexpected nor unhealthy." "My hesitancy about this market is that absolute valuations are still absurdly high, whether you look at price-to-book ratios, price- to-earnings. . . . They're all off the chart," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management.

The name is the game on Wall Street these days.</br></br>A growing number of small public companies are finding that adding ".com" to their name can send their stock soaring. For investors, however, these volatile highfliers pose some particular risks. Many have little or no current operations and don't file financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. And often, the trading pop soon at least partly fizzles.</br></br>Take MIS International. Until January, this largely dormant little outfit traded on Nasdaq's OTC Bulletin Board (for stocks that don't qualify for Nasdaq itself) with daily volume as low as 2,000 shares and a price generally well south of 50 cents a share. The company then acquired a new Internet-oriented business plan and a new name, Cosmoz.com.</br></br>Presto! Trading volume rocketed to as much as six million shares a day and the price briefly hit $5, giving Cosmoz.com a market value of $200 million. Its price has since dropped back to about $2.</br></br>Not too shabby for a company that hasn't yet turned a profit, and whose only operating business so far is a recently purchased financial-markets-information Web site that generates about $200,000 a year in revenue. However, Cosmoz.com does have a "hip" and "catchy" name that "definitely contributed" to the recent stock-market interest, says Wilfred Shaw, chairman and chief executive. He adds that Cosmoz.com has plans to acquire "many Internet companies."
Author: David Wessel</br></br>Four men now face strategic decisions that will shape the political economy of the U.S. for the next couple of years: President Barack Obama, Republican congressional leaders John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke.</br></br>For Mr. Bernanke, the question is what would prompt the Fed to buy even more U.S. Treasury bonds than now planned. Unable to cut short-term interest rates further, Mr. Bernanke figures that printing $600 billion more to buy bonds will push down long-term interest rates (to spur a bit more borrowing), boost stock prices (to make people wealthier so they spend more) and depress the dollar (to give U.S. exports a lift).</br></br>Justifying last week's move, the Fed pointed to inflation below its 2% target and unemployment well above its "maximum sustainable employment" mandate. In part because key officials don't agree, the Fed didn't spell out under what circumstances it would keep buying beyond next June.</br></br>If inflation remains too low and unemployment too high, does the Fed buy more? Or does it only keep buying if its economic forecast worsens? What if it succeeds in getting everyone to anticipate 2% inflation, but unemployment remains high, does it buy more? If not, how does it explain that to American workers?
NEW YORK, July 29 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rails and steels today paced the stock market to its sharpest rally in a month as Wall Street showed relief that more stringent measures had not been suggested by President Johnson in regard to Viet-Nam.</br></br>Uncertainty ns to how much the economy would be affected by new requirements of the conflict in Viet-Nam was removed. The concensus in the financial district was that the present burgeoning economy could take it in stride, on the basis of Mr. Johnsonï¿½Ûªs proposals.</br></br>At the same time, previous fears of a business recession seemed to be eliminated. In audition, greater requirements for military shipments were implicit in the stepping-up of men and materials for the fighting. This, in addition to prospects of increased carloadings of wheat to meet some world shortages, brightened immediate prospects for the railroads.</br></br>At the same time, aerospace defense issues backtracked somewhat from recent gains although certain of those issues were greatly favored, among them Fairchild Camera, which rose 3 as second most active stock</br></br>The most active issue was Polaroid, up 4'/2 at 70 on 110,300 shares. Analysts said this was due largely to short coveringsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ that is, the purchase of shares to repay borrowed stock which had been sold short with the hope of profit by buying replacement stock at lower prices.
NEW YORK -- The stock market turned lower after three days of gains, with volume on the New York Stock Exchange shrinking by 16% from the previous day.</br></br>The lethargic session, analysts and traders said, showed that the 61.35-point jump in the Dow Jones Industrial Average the previous three days probably wasn't the start of a long rally. The industrial average fell 11.92 yesterday to 2141.71 as investors continued to take profits on the gains made early in the week. That tendency had begun to show up Wednesday, when the average rose only 4.27 points after a two-day advance totaling 57.08.</br></br>Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and other developments early in the week lifted the financial markets. But as Mr. Gorbachev cut short his New York visit and rushed home yesterday to deal with the effects of a serious earthquake in Armenia, bearish factors such as the U.S. budget deficit and possibly rising interest rates were back on center stage.</br></br>Stock-index futures traders, meanwhile, continue to insist that the stock market won't really boil until the 280 level on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is broken. They had hoped that would happen yesterday. But the index, which had been rising strongly in recent days, never got above its opening level of 278.13. It closed at 276.57, down 1.56.</br></br>"Stocks are at a stopping point here for a few sessions, based on a normal easing of momentum," said A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research in New York. "There could be a pullback of 20 to 40 points (in the industrial average) over the next few days before it goes higher."
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ NOW THAT we have climbed back aboard the escalator of inflation, certain groups are bound to be hurt. Conspicuous among these are the Nationï¿½Ûªs schoolteachers, whose incomes are slow to respond to a change in prices.</br></br>Numericallyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and hence politicallyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½they are not a strong group. They number about a million, or 1.6 percent of our labor force; but in the coming decade they may well be among the most important workers in our economy. ByU955, it is estimated, there will be some 37 million young Americans in the school-age group between 5 and 17. This will be. 17 percent above 1950.</br></br>Because schoolteachers are not organized, they cannot compete with such potent pressure groups as auto workers or miners. Furthermore, in times of inflation they suffer from the fact that the sources of school revenues are rigid and inflexible.</br></br>Public school teachers depend for their salaries on the local property tax, a * notably unresponsive form of revenue. Private school and college teachers depend, to a considerable extent, on endowment income, much of it Inï¿½Ûªfixed-interest securities like bonds and mortgages.</br></br>The result is that there is a general exodus from the teaching field during inflation. Afterward, teaching salaries tend to catch up again; and in depression the real income of teachers rise very rapidlyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½when^ they get paid.
WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department trimmed its estimate of the economy's fourth-quarter growth rate to a sluggish 1.3% annual rate from the 1.7% reported earlier.</br></br>The weak fourth-quarter expansion in the real gross national product -- the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services -- followed growth at a 2.8% rate in the third quarter. For all of 1986, the economy grew at a 2.5% rate.</br></br>Several economists asserted that the new report suggests the economy is poised for a pick-up in growth. The revision occurred largely because the department found that nonfarm inventory investment was lower in the fourth quarter than originally reported.</br></br>"The story is the big decline in inventories and what that implies for the first quarter," said David Berson, senior economist at Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates in Philadelphia, who predicted that businesses will rebuild inventories in the first quarter. He said Wharton is likely to boost its estimate of first-quarter growth to 3.2% from 3% as a result of the GNP revision.</br></br>Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said, "It seems to me that while the fourth quarter was less than expected we were better positioned as we headed into 1987." In addition to the inventory revision, he said, the new report showed that demand was stronger than indicated earlier.

NEW YORK, Jan. 28ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Interest rate cuts here and abroadï¿½ï¿½ï¿½interpreted as signs that credit conditions are easing significantlyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½almost pulled the stock market out of its first correction of the year this week, but the attempt fell short.</br></br>For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 3.12 points to 844.04. The Broader Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock composite, however, posted a gain of 0.09 point to 8G.16.</br></br>The broadest index of all showed the marketï¿½Ûªs rally continuing, as more stocks advanced than declined for the fourth straight week. There were 836 winners and 615 losers during the week, compared with 1,133 up and 362 down the week before. Now 1966-67 highs were set by 146 stocks, up from 139, and four issues touched new lows, compared with one a week earlier.</br></br>The reductions in prime ratesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½begun at noon Thursday by giant Chase Manhattan Bank ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ caught the Street by surprise and brought a quick turnaround in prices, On Friday, other banks began cutting their prime rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½most notably First National City Bank, which ranks just behind Chase as the nationï¿½Ûªs third largest bank ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but the cuts were only from 6% to 5%%, while Chaseï¿½Ûªs cut was all the way to 5%%.</br></br>Nevertheless, analysts said the moves were proof that the credit squeeEe that plagued the economy all through 1966 had loosened up considerably.
Charles Schwab Corp. posted flat second-quarter profit, but showed signs of emerging from the damage inflicted by low interest rates and money-market fund-fee waivers.</br></br>Schwab, the largest discount brokerage by market capitalization, waived $113 million in such fees over the past three months, posting its first decline in three quarters. With interest rates remaining low, Schwab waived $224 million in such fees in 2009 so that clients' returns wouldn't turn negative.</br></br>In an interview with Dow Jones Newswires, Schwab Chief Financial Officer Joe Martinetto said that "if interest rates stay where they are, we would expect some moderate improvement as we get to the second half of the year."</br></br>Mr. Martinetto declined to provide a specific forecast for fee waivers for the remainder of 2010.</br></br>Reflecting some further optimism for the franchise, Chairman Charles Schwab, in a statement, said cost cuts, stabilizing interest rates and an improving U.S. economy should help results improve from second-quarter levels the rest of the year.
It's the best of times. It's the scariest of times. Last year, U.S. exports, industrial production, real hourly compensation, corporate profits, federal tax revenues, retail sales, GDP, productivity, the number of people with jobs, the number of students in college, airline passenger traffic and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all hit record levels. For the third consecutive year, global growth was strong, continuing to lift (and hold) millions of people out of poverty. From 30,000 feet, heck from 1,000 feet, it sure looks like the best of times.</br></br>In relative terms, the first five years of the current recovery have been much better than the first five years of the 1990s recovery. But all this has not softened the pessimism of many pundits and politicians who are either unimpressed or expect the whole thing to come crashing down any minute. That is, unless the government firmly grabs the reins of the global economy and steers it clear of disaster.</br></br>Many believe that the debate is over on global warming, nationalized health care, tax hikes, rich-versus-poor, the trade deficit and "obscene" oil company profits. Forgotten in this rush to pass judgment on capitalism is the fact that the last two times government seriously tried to control the U.S. economy -- in the 1930s and in the 1970s -- they made a terrible mess of it.</br></br>In the 1930s, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act caused a collapse in global trade, while the Fed allowed the money supply to shrink by one- third. Government regulation in the 1920s prevented banks from branching, which caused more than 10,000 to fail in the 1930s, deepening and prolonging the Great Depression. Herbert Hoover's tax hikes were icing on the cake, capping off a perfect storm of D.C. policy mistakes.</br></br>It took another 35 years, and a nice run of prosperity, but Washington finally gathered the courage to try this again. Between 1965 and 1981, Great Society welfare and health-care programs, wage and price controls, inflationary Fed policy, 70% marginal tax rates, 50% capital-gains tax rates, and highly regulated energy, airline, banking and trucking industries created severe problems. The Misery Index (calculated by adding inflation and unemployment) rose to 21.9% in 1980 (today it is 7.2%).
The Federal Reserve Board yesterday told bank companies experiencing financial difficulties that they should restrict or in some cases eliminate dividends to shareholders.</br></br>The regulatory agency said that banks and companies that own banks (bank holding companies) should not pay dividends that exceed their net income or that would otherwise weaken their financial condition.</br></br>The Federal Reserve regulates about 1,000 of the nationï¿½Ûªs 15,000 banks and all 6,200 bank holding companies. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency two weeks ago issued a similar warning, urging federally chartered banks with problem loans to make sure they add enough profits to reserves before paying dividends to shareholders.</br></br>The dividend policies are merely the latest in a series of actions by bank regulatory agencies designed to pressure bank management into a more conservative financial posture.</br></br>In yesterdayï¿½Ûªs policy statement, the Federal Reserve said that banks and bank holding companies with earnings problems, inadequate capital or other serious problems also should not borrow money to pay dividends nor pay dividends out of unusual or nonrecurring profits, such as the sale of a building.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices spurted yesterday as dealers and investors were cheered by a decline in short-term interest rates.</br></br>An injection of reserves by the Federal Reserve System into the banking network also encouraged traders. Some analysts were surprised by the move and said it might represent an easing of the Fed's credit hold. But many others insisted that the move was needed for technical reasons and that the Fed hasn't changed policy.</br></br>The interest rate on federal funds hovered between 8 1/8% and 8 3/8% yesterday, down from Monday's average of 8.57%. The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight, is watched closely for clues to changes in Fed policy. Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds rose more than 1/2 point, or over $5 for each $1,000 face amount.</br></br>Much of the credit markets' focus yesterday was on the Fed's injection of reserves. The action "could possibly represent an easing move" by the central bank, said Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners. He cautioned, however, that it is "premature to attach any definitive policy significance" to the Fed maneuver.</br></br>The economy's apparent sluggishness in recent months has boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease credit conditions, paving the way for lower interest rates, in an attempt to stimulate business activity. This view was bolstered last week when Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker expressed concern about the lackluster performance of the nation's manufacturing industries.
Correction: A headline on a Nov. 28 Business brief incorrectly said that the Food and Drug Administration had approved an anti-psychotic drug made by Vanda Pharmaceuticals. The FDA accepted the company's application for review of iloperidone.

Fieldstone and C-Bass will try to negotiate an end to any potential legal actions within 60 days.</br></br>Capital One of McLean said it was reorganizing its leadership structure. Dave Lawson, president of the auto-finance business, said he would retire at the end of April. A combination of tighter credit and rising delinquencies led the auto-finance unit to post a $3.8 million loss last quarter, one of the reasons Capital One posted its first quarterly loss. Lawson earned $8.4 million last year, according to regulatory filings.
WASHINGTON -- Inflation news couldn't be much more soothing.</br></br>Wholesale prices unexpectedly fell 0.3% in January, after a 0.6% jump in December, the Labor Department said. Stripping out the volatile food and energy sectors, the producer price index was flat in January after inching up 0.1% the month before. "Extremely well-behaved," said economist Marilyn Schaja of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, New York.</br></br>The scary monster of recent inflation reports -- energy prices -- has been tamed; those prices slipped 0.2% after three consecutive months of sharp acceleration. Given recent declines in crude oil and natural-gas prices, energy prices should come down further in coming months, analysts said. The food index dropped 1.0%, having risen sharply several months earlier when poor weather threatened many crops.</br></br>A few scattered red flags popped up, however. Prices of crude goods such as aluminum and copper shot up 5.2%, and even without food and energy jumped 2.0%. If those goods cost more money, often the products they're used to make will eventually cost more, too. "Recall that in 1994, inflation showed up in the pipeline well ahead of the increases that eventually appeared" in finished goods, warned economist Christopher Low of HSBC Markets Inc., New York. "Don't get complacent."</br></br>But Ms. Schaja of DLJ said analysis indicates a weak relationship between crude-goods prices and finished-goods prices, so very little of that increase should filter through. Also, industrial-material prices have already started coming back down this month, so the January increase likely will be reversed in coming months. Finally, Ms. Schaja noted that year-over-year core crude prices fell 3.7%. Meanwhile, prices of intermediate goods, or semifinished products like yarn and lumber, rose only 0.2%; the core index for intermediate goods was up just 0.1%.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>FIDELITY INVESTMENTS' Contrafund estimates it will declare a capital-gains distribution equal to 9% of the portfolio's net-asset value on Dec. 29.

When Tonya King got off welfare in January and started working as an adult day-care provider for $9 an hour, she knew making ends meet would be tough.</br></br>A few months later, her expectations were confirmed: Her monthly paycheck barely covers her $700 rent and $235 in child care for her two sons. Utilities and other essentials are squeezed out of what's left, with a little help from her parents. She receives food stamps and is on a payment plan with the electric company, but she still finds herself in a hole every 30 days.</br></br>"This job is a blessing," said King, 33, of suburban Richmond, who was on welfare for six months. "I would never want to go back on welfare. I believe in working. But I look at my bills and I look at how I was doing when I was getting help, and I can't help but notice that there isn't much difference."</br></br>The state gives King and other recent welfare recipients $50 a month for a year to help them with the transition. The stipend is only available if clients maintain employment. "Hey, every little bit helps," said King, who also is seeking child support from her ex-husband.</br></br>The cash benefit is one of several efforts that Virginia and other states are using to address the hardships recently discharged welfare clients face.
NEW YORK, Feb. 7ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock marketï¿½Ûªs latest rally attempt almost ran out of friends today, but the list managed to hold on to its first over-all gain in eight trading days. Volume declined for the fourth straight day. *	*----------------------------1</br></br>The softness, which moved in during the second half of the four-hour session, was especially evident in blue chip stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average was the only major indicator to finish with a loss on the day. closing down 1.33 points at 859.92.</br></br>92.06	and the New York Stock Exchange index was ahead 0.08 point to 51.52. Volume ran ahead of Tuesday's pace while the market was rising in the morning, then fell back before the close. At the finish. 8.38 million shares had traded, down from 8.56 million in the previous session and, again, the lowest since 7.77 million on Columbus Day, Oct. 12.</br></br>Advances moved ahead of declines for the first time in eight sessions, but they had lo hold on to do it. At the marketï¿½Ûªs best levels, the winners led the losers by more than 300 stocks, but at the close, there were 637 slocks up and 572 down, compared with 626 losers and 593 winners on Tuesday. New 1967-8 highs rose to 22 from 18 and new lows slipped to 25 from 28.</br></br>The market was treated to some good economic news, but analysts said the activity was still based strongly on technical factors, with attention riveted on the international scene.
The latest place where investors are taking on more risk in exchange for apparently meager returns: the U.S. housing market.</br></br>Bond buyers on Tuesday jockeyed to get a piece of $1.6 billion of riskier Fannie Mae securities, enabling the government-backed mortgage company to twice cut the yields it offered on the debt.</br></br>The offering is Fannie's third sale of so-called risk-sharing certificates that enlist investors to pay for potential defaults on the home loans Fannie guarantees. The riskiest of the securities, linked to loans to home purchasers who paid as little as 3% cash upfront, drew 19 times the bids necessary to complete the sale before yields were cut, said people familiar with the offering.</br></br>The sale of the debt, called Connecticut Avenue Securities after the location of one of the Washington company's offices, is expected to be completed on Wednesday, according to the people.</br></br>Robust investor demand for the deal is the latest sign of investors' willingness to take on more risk in return for higher income amid soft economic growth and low interest rates on safe investments.
MANY HOMEOWNERS with adjustable-rate mortgages are nearing the day when their interest rate gets its first adjustment. Those facing a payment increase likely will be double-checking their lenders' math just to make sure they won't be paying a cent more than they are required.</br></br>But owners whose interest rates are tied to Treasury securities' rates might be puzzled if they try to figure out just how lenders compute their new rates. Typically, these mortgages will be adjusted to a rate that's a percentage point or two above the rate for a one-year or three-year Treasury bill index.</br></br>The trouble seems to be finding out what the index figures are. Many assumed they could simply turn to the appropriate yield figures for Treasury bills published in this newspaper and others. Not so.</br></br>The correct source is the Treasury constant maturities index, and the Federal Reserve System is believed to be the only one that publishes it. This index is a theoretical construct that computes what the yield would be on Treasury securities if issued during that period. Consequently, the index isn't identical to any real security.</br></br>Why was such an obscure index chosen? For one thing, it's difficult to base the rates on actual new issues of Treasury securities because they are auctioned intermittently. In addition, lenders say the constant maturity index is the fairest reflection of the cost of money.
NEW YORK, March 22-The stock market sustained widespread losses today amid some apparent fears that the economy was slowing abruptly.</br></br>Auto, retailing and other issues in industries that generally track the over-all pace of business activity posted some of the most notable declines.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 14.97 points to 1,155.88, bringing its loss since the start of the week to 28.48 points.</br></br>Before the market opened, the government reported that new orders for durable goods fell 1.2 percent in February.</br></br>That unexpected decline seemed to strike stock traders as a signal that a widely forecast slowing in the pace of the economic expansion was occurring sooner and more decisively than they had expected.
Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson told congressmen yesterday he expects the mounting U.S. trade deficit will hit a new high at the end of this month and then start going down.</br></br>Peterson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee he had no figures on the U.S. deficit expected for the second quarter ending with this month, but said the figures for April ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½were not very happy.ï¿½Û The Commerce Department has announced the deficit through April was $2.1 billion. The first quarter trade deficit was $1.5 billion.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 hope and believe that the second quarter will turn out to be the low point,ï¿½Û Peterson said in a brief reference to the trade deficit in the midst of his testimony to the committee.</br></br>Asked later by Rep. Charles W. Whalen Jr. (R-Ohio) how confident he is that the United States will begin closing the deficit in the third quarter, Peterson said he could make no firm projections.</br></br>Peterson said the U.S. trade balance ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½its exports measured against its importsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½had swung drastically from a $7 billion surplus in 1964 to a $2 billion deficit at the end of last year.
NEW YORK -- The dollar has made a modest comeback after its slide in recent weeks, but a number of hurdles lie ahead.</br></br>With global central banks still apparently poised to squelch any fierce rally and a wider U.S. trade deficit forecast, currency analysts say the dollar isn't out of the woods.</br></br>"The dollar is going to be very volatile," says Diego Giurleo, manager of corporate trading at the Royal Bank of Canada.</br></br>The central banks of major nations appear eager to keep the dollar within prescribed ranges.</br></br>U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady appeared Friday on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" program and said it is important for the dollar to hold in the trading bands it maintained between the last two gatherings of the Group of Seven major industrial nations.
Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee</br></br>March 20-21, 2007</br></br>A meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee was held in the offices of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, March 20, 2007 at 2:30 p.m., and continued on Wednesday, March 21, 2007 at 9:00 a.m.</br></br>The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets. There were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the System's account in the period since the previous meeting. The Manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on System open market transactions in government securities and federal agency obligations during the period since the previous meeting. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified these transactions.</br></br>The information reviewed at the March meeting indicated that the economy appeared to be expanding at a modest pace in the first quarter. Declines in residential construction activity continued to weigh on overall activity, and business investment had softened considerably over the preceding several months, especially in equipment used in the construction and motor vehicle industries. However, consumer spending had increased appreciably in the early part of the year, and labor demand continued to expand, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, the twelve-month increase in core consumer prices remained elevated relative to its pace one year earlier.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Stocks pulled back a bit despite a strong profit report from Intel, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite Index.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.93 points, or 0.1%, to 9803.05; the Nasdaq Composite Index shed 4.09, or 0.21%, to 1939.1; and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.72, or 0.26%, to 1046.76.</br></br>Shares of tech bellwether Intel rose 68 cents, or 2.2%, to $31.76 following the company's report after the close of trading Tuesday that third-quarter profit more than doubled on 20% revenue growth, which topped the company's own raised expectations. With yesterday's gain, Intel's stock price is up 100% this year.</br></br>Other semiconductor-related stocks did well, including Novellus Systems, advancing 1.12, or 3%, to 38.54 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after the chip-equipment maker reported earnings of four cents a share before items, beating Wall Street's prediction that the company would break even for the period.

The chief executive of the largest bank in the Maryland suburbs yesterday predicted that interest rates could rise to 30 percent in future years if inflation and other economic problems arenï¿½Ûªt brought under control.</br></br>Robert Tardio. chairman of Suburban Bancorporation, made the prediction at Suburbanï¿½Ûªs annual stockholdersï¿½Ûª meeting, attended by more than 200 executives and stockholders.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I believe that if we donï¿½Ûªt come to grips with the problems of inflation and; other things like productivity in this; country, the next time around interest rates could approximate 30 percent,ï¿½Û Tardio said in a brief interview after the meeting.</br></br>Tardio said the interest rate cycles would show ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½great volatilityï¿½Û and that rates would continue to show ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½high peaks and very depressed valleys.ï¿½Û This year the prime interest. rate could fall to between 10 percent and 12 percent, he added.</br></br>Tardio predicted that interest rates would ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½fall precipitouslyï¿½Û this year but that the borrowing rates then would ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½have a new (higher) base from which to climb in the future.ï¿½Û
On Tuesday the market was in full retreat with Treasuries declining ; around two points. Three factors put the skids to the market. Henry; Kaufman of Salomon Brothers gave a bearish "Catch 22ï¿½Û speech on * the credit markets and economy in which he reiterated that current' fiscal and monetary policy would prohibit the economy from going ; anywhere soon. He reasoned that when the economy eased and interest rates would fall, there would be an increase in the demand for credit and a pickup in the economy. However, as the economy would-', improve, interest rates would rise again and choke off any extended . recovery. Kaufman referred to this scenario as the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sputter and spurt economy.ï¿½Û</br></br>Federal funds, that rate at which banks lend their free reserves to each other, rose to 16 percent from 14.50 percent on Tuesday and this, too, hurt the markets. Finally, a better than expected retail sales ï¿½Û¢ï¿½Û¢ number showed that the consumer was not dead and consequently : there was still some life in the faltering economy.	-	-</br></br>With a declining economy the question may be asked, why do interest rates remain high? The main reason is that the Federal Reserve Board wants interest rates to remain high for various reasons. They are determined to curtail inflation, the real menace to our economy and the public at this time. The administration and the monetarists^ believe that the absolute main cause of inflation is the excessiyeC^ growth of the money supply. The money supply grows when commeiijS? cial banks extend credit. Therefore if the Fed limits the amount dr reserves that banks need to extend credit, eventually high interest rates will ration the availability of credit to borrowers, which in turn1' " limits the growth of the money supply.	/</br></br>In a capitalistic system economic growth is generated from savings^ ;;. In recent years, we have saved less and consumed more. This was a ,;; natural act on our part since the rate of inflation was higher than returns available on financial assets. Today the situation is revers<edJg| Inflation is around 9 percent while the returns on Treasuries are' ï¿½Û¢ ? around 15 percent. There is a real incentive on the part of the public to own financial assets. The fact that the money market funds havq; 1 grown to $164 billion attests to the attraction of high interest rates ay ' an inducement to save.</br></br>An aside to the savings situation is the related problem of federal-, budget deficits. It is estimated that the savings by the public in 19$ 1 will be around $170 billion. With the Treasury having to borrow $80^, billion or more to finance the deficit, the remaining amount of savings Jj is left for the corporate, state and local governments and mortgage ï¿½ borrowers. Further, if the economy picks up steam these private bor- * rowers will need more funds, which will conflict even more with the* Treasury for the limited pool of savings. The end result is high inter-* est rates.	**	*
IF YOU LISTEN to Milton Friedmanï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ and more and more economists and official!' today arc doing soï¿½ï¿½ï¿½he will tell you that, fiscal policy (the level of tax and spending totals) is unimportant. The only relevancQ, of fiscal policy, soys Friedman, Is the In-: fluence lit brings to bear on the seven goyT, ernors of the Federal Reserve System, who set monetary policy, which he says is al^. important.</br></br>To put his point concretely: In early and mid-1968, all of the Keynesians still running, the Johnson economic team pul their faith in a 10 per cent surtax, generating a shift</br></br>Congress put through the tax, and there was a reversal of fiscal policy that produced a $3.1 billion surplus in fiscal 1969, a stunning change from a deficit of $25.2 billion in fiscal 1968. Taking the two years together, that was a net toughening of fiscal policy by $28.3 billion.</br></br>But we know now that it didnï¿½Ûªt, even with an extension of the surplus to a projected $5.9 billion in fiscal 1970.</br></br>Why? Because, Friedman will tell you, whatever anti-inflationary effect the surcharge had, it was more than counter-balanced when the Federal Reserve decided in mid-1968 that the money supply had to be expanded to prevent ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½overkill.ï¿½Û It was one of those classic, egregious mistakes on which the Federal Reserve seems to own a patent.
Correction: The Oct. 9 Federal Diary column gave an incorrect Internet address for Understanding Government. The group's Web site is http://www.understandinggov.org. (Published 10/14/2006)</br></br>As federal employees understand all too well, it's sometimes hard to sort out myth and fact in Washington.</br></br>Last week, the White House budget office posted a paper on one of the Bush administration's Web sites (www.results.gov) that, from its perspective, tried to set the record straight on the president's management agenda for the government.</br></br>That agenda has been controversial since it began five years ago -- in part because it promotes contracting out federal work and more rigorous approaches to measuring the performance of employees and programs. It's safe to predict that a number of the "facts" in this new paper will be disputed by federal unions and in some quarters of Congress.</br></br>Federal employees also will bring their workplace experiences to bear when assessing the Office of Management and Budget's paper, which pulls together the administration's explanations on contentious sections of the agenda. Among the paper's points:
Because of seasonal trends, the number of job holders in the Washington metropolitan area increased by 5,700 from October to November, although unemployment also edged upward by 0.2 per cent for the same period, according to government figure.</br></br>The D.C. manpower administration said, in releasing the two-month employment study, that the increase in the number of jobs from 1,323,800 in October to 1,329,500 in November was due largely to temporary employees hired for the Christmas shopping season.</br></br>The month-to-month employ-' ment gain was slightly higher this year than the increase in jobs of 5,100 reported for October and November in 1971.	'</br></br>The number of unemployed in the metropolitan area rose from 36,600 in October to 39,-500 in November, the report stated.	i</br></br>The manpower administration report said the rise in the number of jobless was also at-j tributable to seasonal factors.
Sen. Warren B. Rudman (R-N.H.), one of the most outspoken, influential and effective senators of the past decade, said yesterday he will not seek a third term this fall because of frustration over paralysis in government and his own powerlessness to do anything about it.</br></br>"Frankly, if I thought I could make a difference, I would have stayed, but I don't," said the irascible but well-liked New Englander, who, despite his frustrations, was credited by colleagues with having had more of an impact than many senators who have served far longer on Capitol Hill.</br></br>Rudman, a 61-year-old lawyer, cited the stalemate over curbing budget deficits as his chief source of frustration and warned that the huge federal debt could undermine the nation's security in a few years.</br></br>"I will miss the people, not the frustration," Rudman added, reflecting a broad and deepening concern on the part of the most conscientious lawmakers on Capitol Hill about governmental gridlock, their inability to break it and the rage they are incurring from constituents as a result.</br></br>Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who is seeking reelection this year, said many senators share Rudman's frustrations and "a lot" are considering quitting for the same reasons. "We have been so polarized by single-issue groups, special-interest groups, lobbyists and the rest that it's not easy to get together and solve anything anymore . . . and it's not easy to contemplate continuing in this vein."
Leon H. Keyserling yester-i day accused the Administration and "powerful private propogandaï¿½Û of waging a fake fight against inflation to keep down wages.</br></br>Keyserling, who was chairman. of President Trumanï¿½Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers, said the "spurious campaign" has been used to defeat or block major national objectives. '</br></br>He urged junking of tight money policies and proposed increased Federal spending to spur the rate of economic growth .</br></br>Keyserlingï¿½Ûªs latest analysis appears in a 59-page report entitled ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Inflation.ï¿½Û It was released yesterday by his Con: ference on Economic Progress.</br></br>Keyserling declared that restrictive credit and budget policies are appropriate to wartime eras, when, he said, most ihflatlon occurs. In peacetime, he said, this ap; proach halts the pace of economic gain and leads to less than full use of manpower and other'resources.
NEW YORK -- The dollar continued its southward path yesterday, dragged down sharply against the mark and the yen by persistent concerns about U.S. and Latin American asset markets and the direction of U.S. interest rates.</br></br>Systemic risk within the U.S. financial sector again weighed on the minds of nervous investors as falling banking stocks led Wall Street into yet another nosedive.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 7632.53, down 210.09 points, while the flight into U.S. government bonds pushed down the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue to a 4.875%, the lowest level for long-term bonds since June 1967.</br></br>Meanwhile, the Bovespa index fell 9.6% in Brazil, where fears of a devaluation in the local currency, the real, are intensifying ahead of this weekend's presidential election.</br></br>As went U.S. and regional stocks, so went the dollar. It fell to another 19-month low against the mark and gave up about half the gains it posted Wednesday against the yen.
Savings and loan associations in Maryland and Virginia are paying some of the highest interest rates in the nation on savings accounts, using their premium rates to attract millions of dollars of new deposits.</br></br>Advertising in national publications to reach savers far beyond their local markets, financial institutions in the two states are offering as much as 2 percentage points more on some accounts than prevailing rates in other parts of the country.</br></br>Rate-monitoring services report that local institutions are paying the highest interest anywhere on intermediate and long-term savings accounts, and their rates for all categories of accounts are consistently among the nationï¿½Ûªs highest.</br></br>The high rates are one reason the Maryland General Assembly has formed a special savings task force that is scheduled to meet for the first time tomorrow.</br></br>The panel has not yet publicly stated the object of its inquiry, but its chairman, Sen. Howard A. Denis (R-Dist. 16), recently suggested one concern: fear that the state is being used as a conduit for what is known in the industry as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hot money.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hot moneyï¿½Û refers to potentially unstable deposits, drawn by high interest rates, that could be pulled out at any time, possibly causing a shortage of funds for the institution.
Consumersï¿½Ûª confidence m the economy continued to slide this month, the Conference Board reported yesterday, the latest sign of a halting recovery from the recession that ended nearly two years ago.</br></br>The decline in the index of consumer confidence was the fourth drop in five months following a brief Christmas euphoria that saw a surge in consumer spending. The May reading of 6L5 now stands at its lowest point since last October. A 100 reading reflects the confidence levels of 1985.</br></br>The whole issue now is jobsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we see it dear as a bell,'ï¿½Ûª said Fabian Linden, who directs the monthly study at the Conference Board, a private business research organization. The report showed that only one in eight Americans expects the job market to grow in the next six months.</br></br>leagues and neighbors losing jobs at supposedly solid companies and graduating students unable to get jobs. There's a lot of anxiety out there" he said.</br></br>Speaking to a Dallas gathering of business leaders yesterday. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said conditions are ripe for a major expansion in job growth, predicting an end to large-scale layoffs as the nationï¿½Ûªs corporate downsizing frees up new money.
A late burst of profit-taking and other quarter-ending portfolio shifts cut into a broad advance today, but some stock measures edged high enough to set records.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.25 points at 5882.17 at the close, having retreated from a 30-point gain that would have broken last Monday's record of 5894.74.</br></br>Most broad measures withstood the late selling to end the day higher. Much of the session's volatility was attributed to last-minute positioning by money managers trying to put a shine on their quarter-ending reports to investors.</br></br>"There's a lot of money moving around, but a pretty nice tone," said Andrew M. Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore.</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the New York Stock Exchange composite index reached record highs. But the Nasdaq Stock Market pulled lower as investors secured profits from the technology sector, which bounced back to life in September after lagging the rebound from July's rout.
DALLAS -- Sunshine Mining Co. said it signed a letter of intent to buy Rexene Corp. for $28 a share, or $865.2 million, in cash and securities, but the market responded skeptically to the proposal.</br></br>Rexene's shares fell $2.50 yesterday to close at $22, after climbing more than $6 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday.</br></br>The drop resulted from concern about how much and what kinds of securities will be offered and how the transaction will be financed. The two companies said the financing and the exact amounts of cash and securities haven't been determined, and won't be disclosed until they reach a definitive agreement, which is expected before Jan. 31.</br></br>The accord highlights the role that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has come to play as both suitor and matchmaker in the business world. Drexel and a group of more than 100 employees would reap fees and huge profits from the combination of two clients.</br></br>The purchase also allows Sunshine, a precious metals and oil and gas concern, to diversify into the chemicals business, while giving Rexene access to about $175 million in tax benefits to shield its healthy profits.
The scone was Anwar Sadatï¿½Ûªs palatial retreat, 20 minutes outside of Cairo. The garden gate was guarded by a lone soldier. There was no one else in sight -other than a lanky figure in a dark blue suit, stretched out on a lawn chair some 50 yards away, reading a hook and sipping iced tea.</br></br>*	Apart from the brief appearance of a photographer, that was the extent of the ceremony. My first and lasting impression of the president of Egypt, then, was that he was an'Unpretentious man; my second (equally on- ; during) impression, from what he . had to say in a taped interview lasting more than an hour, was that here was a man with a vision that went far beyond the politicianï¿½Ûªs obligatory protestations of a desire for peace.</br></br>That was in February 1975, when llenry Kissinger was in mid-shuttle, a reconvening of the Genova conference on Middle Fast peace was the commonly accepted goal, and the celebrated visit to Jerusalem was lie-</br></br>Everything that followed, of course, lias confirmed that first impression. making it all the more . tragically ironic that Anwar Sadat . should have died in the pomp and circumstance of a military parade.</br></br>This is not to lay claim to some special insight; the glimpses of what . was to come, at Sadatï¿½Ûªs hands, in the shaping and forming of a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½peace pro-! cessï¿½Û culminating at Camp David, was in his message six years ago.
WASHINGTON -- With inflation soon likely to drop into the Federal Reserve's so-called comfort zone of 1% to 2%, Fed officials are seeking to shift their emphasis away from today's benign inflation readings to the more uncertain path of future inflation.</br></br>To that end, the central bank's policy makers, when they meet next Wednesday and Thursday, are likely to continue to highlight the risks that low unemployment could yet push inflation higher.</br></br>At next week's meeting, Fed officials are expected to debate whether to continue describing inflation as "elevated" in their post-meeting policy statement, an issue complicated by their lack of consensus on whether inflation ought to be much lower than it already is.</br></br>There is little chance the Fed will alter its target for short-term interest rates, which has stood at 5.25% since last summer. Officials appear on hold for at least the next several months.</br></br>Inflation alarms sounded at the Fed when the annual pace of core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped to 2.4% in February from 2.1% in December, as measured by the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- the price index for personal consumption expenditures. The jump prompted officials to describe inflation as "elevated" following their March and May meetings.

Prince George's County Executive Wayne K. Curry yesterday proposed increasing school spending by $59 million, which would fund a teachers' raise, two new elementary schools and about 40 new guidance counselors.</br></br>The $1 billion school spending plan was a key part of Curry's annual budget presentation, a proposal he touted for containing none of the service cuts or tax increases contemplated in neighboring areas.</br></br>"That's a whole lot of zeroes," Curry (D) said at a news conference in Upper Marlboro, referring to the money for schools.</br></br>Nevertheless, the school increase was far less than the $158 million boost that Board of Education officials had requested. And Curry's proposal contained no money to reduce class sizes, something that Schools Superintendent Iris T. Metts listed as her top priority.</br></br>Curry said it would be unwise to spend money on hiring more teachers to cut class sizes when there isn't enough classroom space. But school board members, who had requested $11.5 million for the initiative, say it can be accomplished by assigning two teachers to a single class.
SINGAPORE -- Singapore's reputation as a haven for those seeking solid, if not spectacular, gains took a hit in the first quarter, as the market's main index fell more sharply than all others in Southeast Asia.</br></br>But that doesn't mean investors should shift to higher-risk, potentially higher-return Asian markets, fund managers and analysts say. Instead, they say, investors need to study what has changed in Singapore companies while maintaining a long-term view. Those with a distant horizon and stock-picking acumen have found Singapore a good investment, they say.</br></br>Singapore's Straits Times Index was closed yesterday for a holiday, as other major markets in Asia finished higher. Continental European markets were generally higher, while London was closed for a holiday. Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.01 point, or 0.01%, to 199.28. Excluding the U.S., the index rose 0.58 point, or 0.40%, to 146.77.</br></br>The first quarter proved that during global selloffs, the redundant phrase "safe haven" doesn't exist for stocks. "The only safe haven is cash -- or utilities in Hong Kong," says Sean Darby, regional strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.</br></br>And some analysts and strategists aren't sure all the bad news has come out. Merrill Lynch has been "underweight" on Singapore for more than a year. And analysts believe that changes due May 19 in Morgan Stanley Capital International indexes will cut weightings for some local companies.
NEW YORK -- Bank of New York Co. won an additional 60 days from the Federal Reserve Board to wage its hostile $1.3 billion offer for Irving Bank Corp.</br></br>Irving, which has endorsed a rival offer from Italy's second-largest bank, Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A., had opposed the extension. The Fed's approval had been scheduled to expire last Saturday.</br></br>But in granting the extension, the Fed expressed concern about the drain in money and management attention from the 10-month takeover battle and urged the banks to conclude it quickly.</br></br>Bank of New York is offering $15 cash and 1.575 of its own shares for each share of Irving, or $70.125 a share, based on Bank of New York's closing price of $35 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Banca Commerciale is offering $80 cash and $4 a share in warrants for 51% of Irving; its application won't be ruled on by the Fed until fall.</br></br>If Irving would agree to a friendly merger, Bank of New York has proposed sweetening its bid to $15 cash, 1.675 of its own shares and $5 a share in special dividends, or $78.625 a share. However, the Fed said that Bank of New York would have to issue new stock to finance any special dividend.
THE DEMOCRATS made much of the fact that in this year's budget resolution they moved away from the president's priorities toward their own by shifting several billion dollars into social welfare programs. It wasn't a lot of money, but these are tight budget times, and the Democrats were able to say it was all they had.</br></br>Now, however, Congress has gone from the budget process of enunciating goals to the appropriations process of carrying them out, and guess what? The appropriations committees, also Democratic, are shifting some of the money back. Interest groups are complaining that the subcommittees with jurisdiction over the programs of the departments of labor, education and health and human services have been given too little money to do the job.</br></br>The question is, which is the Democrats' true face or, put another way, to what extent are they willing to impose costs elsewhere in society to achieve their objectives? The issue has now arisen a second time with the promulgation by the leaders of both houses, as Congress broke for Memorial Day, of a Democratic "action plan for economic recovery and growth." As with the budget resolution, it is once again commendable, responsible - and made up entirely of goals.</br></br>The Democrats' theme is that the middle class and poor were left behind in the Reagan-Bush years and that the Bush administration is now glossing over what has turned out to be more than a short and shallow recession. "We can wait and hope that things will improve, that's the president's course, or we can act. That's our course. Democrats don't think that we can afford just to hope our way into the 21st century," Senate majority leader George Mitchell said yesterday.</br></br>Act how? The Democrats said they were committed to tax relief for the middle class, a strengthening of unemployment compensation, a highway bill to provide both jobs and a modern infrastructure, broader access to health care, increased aid to both higher and elementary and secondary education, a strengthening of the safety net, including the federal feeding programs for the poor, and "an aggressive energy policy."
NEW YORK -- Amid signs that the Federal Reserve is near the end of its aggressive rate-cutting campaign, the bond market appears at a turning point.</br></br>Investors widely expect Fed policy makers, who meet again tomorrow, to cut interest rates once more. But what happens after that is less clear.</br></br>Many in the market believe any rate reduction tomorrow could be the last the Fed makes in this interest-rate cycle. They cite evidence that consumer sentiment, wages, retail sales and the equities markets either remain fairly strong or are recovering from weakness last winter.</br></br>The implications are crucial to the Treasurys market, which staged a yearlong rally as the economy and the stock market began to languish and as the Fed cut short-term interest rates by two percentage points in the first four months of this year.</br></br>If interest rates are near their lows of this cycle, and if the economy finally is stirring in response to the Fed's strong medicine, the outlook for Treasurys is considerably less bright, analysts note.
The Treasury Department is not worried that the weakening dollar, which makes U.S. assets less attractive, will affect the level of foreign demand for government securities, a Treasury official said yesterday.</br></br>The official, Charles O. Sethness, assistant secretary for domestic finance, also said Treasury plans to sell $29 billion in new securities in its quarterly refunding next week to raise $14.3 billion in new cash and refund $14.7 billion of publicly held coupon securities maturing on Feb. 15.</br></br>Some financial market analysts had expressed concern during the past few weeks that the sharp dip in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen would make U.S. Treasury securities less attractive to Japanese investors, requiring the Treasury to bid up interest rates on those issues to lure foreigners back.</br></br>A weaker dollar means that foreigners earn less on their investments when their profits are converted into their own currencies. The government needs foreign participation in its securities to finance the deficit.</br></br>The government said in a special budget supplement issued yesterday that the proportion of federal debt held by foreigners has actually declined compared to the late 1970s and early 1980s. For example, foreigners held 19 percent of U.S. debt in 1979, compared with 15 percent last year. The government attributed this trend to the ï¿½Û¢ rapid growth in total government securities outstanding.
The air is thick with hyperbole, invented statistics and insults to the other guy's mother. Congress must be gearing up to debate Nafta. Perhaps before we get in too deep, it would be helpful to tune out the demagoguery and listen to what leveler heads say on the central issue here: free trade.</br></br>The first level head, Ronald Reagan, discusses Nafta nearby (see related article: "Tear Down the Trade Wall" -- WSJ Sept. 13, 1993). We'd like to talk about Adam Smith and David Ricardo, the great economists who laid the groundwork for our understanding of the West's spectacular rise to prosperity. Mr. Ricardo was a Jewish stockbroker who married a Quaker, made a fortune in the stock market and retired young to think about economics. Mr. Smith, the author of "The Wealth of Nations," needs no introduction.</br></br>Messrs. Smith and Ricardo first sketched out the idea that 200 years later remains an article of faith among economists. The idea is called comparative advantage. It says: Let us each specialize in the production of what we're good at, and then trade the fruits of our labor.</br></br>Consider Joe Sixpack, who makes his living fixing cars. With the money he earns, he pays other people to grow his food, assemble his refrigerator and program his Gameboy. Nobody would advise Mr. Sixpack to knock off early at the auto shop and grow his own corn. He can enjoy more of everything by fixing more cars, which is his comparative advantage.</br></br>Notice that it doesn't matter at all to Mr. Sixpack that his Gameboy was programmed in Japan and his frijoles were grown by a Mexican. Adam Smith put it this way: "If a foreign country can supply us with a commodity cheaper than we ourselves can make it, better buy it of them with some part of the produce of our own industry, employed in a way in which we have some advantage."
NEW YORK -- Now that the Federal Reserve seems to have eased its credit clamp based on the belief the economy has slowed, we will soon see whether the latest figures agree.</br></br>Generally, expectations call for an easing in many of this week's May economic reports, including retail sales, industrial production and capacity utilization. But the consumer price index outlook is disturbing in light of last Friday's unexpected 0.9% surge in May producer prices.</br></br>Nonetheless, the consensus view calls for another impressive month of progress on the trade deficit after March's $1 billion decline, although economists have issued warnings to watch out for revisions.</br></br>Combined with April's weak employment report the forthcoming data "pretty much paint a weak picture" if on target, said Stuart G. Hoffman, senior economist at PNC Financial Corp., Pittsburgh.</br></br>That should be comforting news to the Fed, which eased credit last week after a year of tightening. The agency seems to be acting on the conviction that it has throttled the economy and sidestepped troublesome inflation. "Now," said Mr. Hoffman, "we wait for them to do it again."
For the first time in more than two years, state budget officials reported that tax revenue had stopped falling significantly faster than expected and, in fact, would probably begin growing again by the end of the current budget year.</br></br>"I don't want to jinx us," said Comptroller Peter Franchot (D), "but I'm hoping the days of massive write-downs are behind us."</br></br>The state's latest forecast -- $77 million less in tax revenue than projected -- represents a loss about one-tenth the size of those in each of Maryland's previous four quarterly reports, and it amounts to a fraction of the $3.2 billion in combined revenue write-downs since last December.</br></br>It was good news, but it also laid bare the treacherous course that Maryland and other states have to climb to escape the effects of the recession.</br></br>After using furloughs instead of widespread layoffs and one-time cost cuts instead of the wholesale elimination of programs, Gov. Martin O'Malley and the state's Democratic-controlled General Assembly face a projected budget gap of nearly $2 billion in the coming fiscal year -- a shortfall as big as at any point since the recession began.
Author: Paul Ziobro</br></br>Higher commodity costs will dent Procter & Gamble Co. earnings by $1 billion in current fiscal year, double what it expected earlier.</br></br>P&G's sobering assessment of rising world-wide commodity costs came after the world's largest consumer-products company saw gross margins fall to 51.8% in its second-quarter from 53.7% a year earlier. P&G's spot prices for production materials and energy are up more than 20% from last year, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said Thursday.</br></br>The higher costs come as P&G still grapples with weak demand for products in developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe, where the economic recovery has lagged growth in emerging markets. P&G plans to offset the higher costs by raising prices in some markets and trying to sell more higher priced items.</br></br>"In terms of ability to pass through, we're really in a good position on that regard," P&G Chief Executive Bob McDonald said on an investor call.
That's the value of an estimated 30 million of the newly redesigned S50 bills it has sitting in bank vaults around tile country. The bills are among the first that came off the presses at theBureauof Engraving an d Printing this year. But after Federal Reserve officials spotted a minor printing flaw on the bills, the Fed said it may not place them in circulation.</br></br>The,errorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½said to be visible to the naked eyeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consists of gapsinthetinyconcentriclines behind the enlarged portrait of President Ulysses S. Grant on the bills.</br></br>Those lines are among the anti-counterfeiting devices designers at the bureau have worked into anew scries of high-tech currency that the Treasury Department is introducing. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This series of fine lines is very difficult to reproduce with color copiers, computer scanners and other traditional printing technologies,ï¿½Û theTreasury Department said when the first of tlie redesigned currencyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the $100 billï¿½ï¿½ï¿½was introduced in late 1995.</br></br>Bureau spokesman Larry Felix said such flaws as the broken lines are notunusual in other bills. But since the new $50 bill is supposed to represent the best currency printing in tlie world, officials at the Fed are reluctant to introduce a bill with an obvious flaw.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Some donï¿½Ûªt look too bad," said Fed spokesman Joseph R. Coyne. He said banking officials want to study the error longer before deciding whether to release tlie bills.
The nation's governors, alarmed by a steep decline in revenues last month, appealed yesterday to Congress and the Bush administration for emergency assistance. Unless help comes soon, they warned, states will have to slash their spending, thereby increasing the risk of a serious recession.</br></br>Michigan Gov. John Engler (R), the chairman of the National Governors Association, told reporters in a conference call from Lansing that since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, many states have seen a double-digit drop in tax receipts compared with a year ago.</br></br>The governors suggested steps they would like to see included in the stimulus package being drafted on Capitol Hill, with the blessing of the Bush administration.</br></br>In addition to expanded unemployment, health and other benefits for families of laid-off workers, they asked for relief from some federal regulations and the suspension of state matching requirements on major federal highway, airport and other construction programs.</br></br>Engler and Kentucky Gov. Paul E. Patton (D), who is vice chairman of the governors association and presented the program to members of Congress yesterday, emphasized that unless help comes soon, balanced- budget requirements in most state constitutions will force program cuts and layoffs, deepening the economic slump.
WASHINGTON--Top business executives, many of whom sat on their hands during last year's frantic debate about raising the federal debt ceiling, have begun mobilizing and plan to be more vocal in urging Congress to reach a bipartisan deficit-reduction deal by the end of the year.</br></br>Executives have been meeting privately with lawmakers, urging them to start laying the groundwork now so they can reach an agreement after the November elections to avoid the large tax increases and heavy spending cuts scheduled to take effect in January. They worry those measures could tip the economy back into recession and create turmoil in financial markets, according to people who have attended some of the meetings.</br></br>J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief executive James Dimon hosted a lunch for several dozen chief executives and two U.S. senators late last month, one of the latest in a series of private meetings aimed at drumming up support for a political agreement.</br></br>Several executives left the J.P. Morgan lunch, held at the company's headquarters in New York, resolved to speak more forcefully in favor of a deal. Many believe both Democrats and Republicans will have to compromise on a deal that includes both tax increases and spending cuts, and several have pointed to the 2010 Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction plan as a model Congress should begin working on immediately. Mr. Dimon, in public remarks last week, called for Republicans and Democrats to come together to enact such a plan. "We've got to get it done," Mr. Dimon said. "Our problem is we don't have the will. We can't seem to get our act together."</br></br>In separate initiatives, chief executives such as Laurence Fink of BlackRock, Terry Lundgren of Macy's Inc. and Mark Bertolini of Aetna Inc. have told lawmakers over meetings and dinners they should start discussing a deal soon, people attending the meetings said.
Stocks struggled to a mixed finish today, weighed down by weakness in the bond market as some surprisingly strong economic readings undermined confidence about inflation and interest rates.</br></br>But the Nasdaq market and other indexes that are dominated by smaller and more speculative shares outperformed the blue chips and set records again as investors hunted bargains.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.61 to 5635.05 as the past week's rebound continued to sputter. The barometer of 30 big U.S. companies had gained more than 28 points earlier in the day, but slid lower as bond prices fell and interest rates rose.</br></br>Broader measures dominated by larger companies retreated from modest gains as the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark used to determine the interest charged on many loans -- topped 6.9 percent.</br></br>Bonds initially were weakened today by three reports that ran slightly counter to recent indications of moderate economic growth and modest inflation.
Share prices slumped on the London Stock Exchange Wednesday, in response to high interest rates in the U.S. and a stronger dollar.</br></br>The Financial Times industrial share index fell 17.3 points, to 814.9, with major oil issues among the losers. A broker said investors also were reacting to news of an improvement in the U.S. output of goods and services.</br></br>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Dow Jones average rose 39.88 points, to 10237.22, in steady trading. The stock exchange's index rose 3.64 points, to 783.79.</br></br>Analysts said shares of asset-rich concerns, such as Nippon Express Co., Toei Co. and Sapporo Breweries Ltd., did well. Investors also began to show more interest in blue chips than previously, though one broker said the apparent shift could be sustained only by a continued rally in New York.</br></br>The gold mines index fell 2.7 points, to 653.3. en
The spotlight in Europe's new-issue stock market is focused almost exclusively on telecommunications-industry offerings, as investors battle for the growing numbers of newly public enterprises.</br></br>Zurich-based Carrier1 International SA became the latest beneficiary of the fervor for telecommunications stocks yesterday, as investors in both Europe and the U.S. fought for a piece of the company's initial public offering. Even after both the size and the price range of the IPO were boosted by the underwriters -- led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and Citigroup Inc.'s Salomon Smith Barney -- the issue was still about 30 times oversubscribed.</br></br>The IPO of 9.375 million shares was priced at 87 euros a share ($87.27) raising $818.2 million and giving the company a stock-market value of roughly $3.5 billion. The shares priced above the range at which they had been marketed, which already had been boosted from the initial range of between $65 and $75 each. Underwriters have the option to sell an additional 1.4 million shares to help meet the excess demand.</br></br>The company, which is less than two years old, will begin trading today on both the Nasdaq Stock Market and Germany's Neuer Markt, the growth-stock division of the Deutsche Boerse. About a third of the shares were sold to U.S. investors and the remaining two-thirds sold in Europe.</br></br>Carrier1 is just the latest example of how telecommunications companies dominate the financing landscape in Europe. Carrier1 is building a European fiber-optic network.
.NEW YORK, Aug. 17 (AP>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Late buying rescued a faltering stock market advance today and the list ended irregularly higher in fairly active trading.</br></br>The ticker tape lagged in a buying spurt just before the close. An hour earlier so many of the initial gains had been cut or erased that it looked as if the market might end with a slight loss if the erosion continued.</br></br>The market was higher in early trading but backtracked most of the afternoon as turnover faded. Prices steadied, however, and as action became dull new buying came in. Brokers said much of this was short covering in anticipation of an expected increase in the short position to be announced Thursday. This refers to the total number of borrowed shares sold in the hope that they can be replaced by stock bought at a low er price.</br></br>Autos were early leaders in the advance. General Motors was spurred by talk of better earnings and the possibility of a year-end extra dividend. American .Motors topped the most-active list, rising lr,ï¿½ï¿½ to 231* on 110,400 shares, helped by news of the expansion program for production of its Rambler car.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.11 to 626.54, continuing its penetration of the 625 level which has been regarded as an upside barrier.
Sung Won Sohn can thank a pair of $250 denim jeans for his top place in The Wall Street Journal's annual U.S. economic-forecasting rankings.</br></br>Earlier in the year Mr. Sohn, economist and chief executive of Hanmi Financial Corp. in Los Angeles, was visiting a California jeans producer whose executives told him they couldn't keep up with demand for high-priced clothing. He figured "there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much" for bluejeans. The insight -- along with reports from other clients that costs were rising -- led Mr. Sohn, 61 years old, to increase his 2005 projection for inflation and to stick with his call for healthy economic growth in the U.S.</br></br>The resulting prediction of growth of about 3.8% for the first three quarters and above-trend inflation of about 3.6% left him ahead of the pack when the results were tabulated. U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier. Most other economists had forecast lower inflation and a little less growth in 2005. (Preliminary estimates of fourth-quarter growth are slated for later in January.)</br></br>Also among the most accurate were J. Dewey Daane, a retired professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee; Mickey Levy, chief economist at Bank of America in New York; Gail Fosler, chief economist with the Conference Board in New York; and Maria Fiorini Ramirez of MFR Inc., an economic-consulting firm in New York. All five had above-average inflation forecasts, and three of the five had above-average growth forecasts.</br></br>Many forecasters rely on econometric models to come up with forecasts for economic growth, inflation, interest rates and exchange rates. Mr. Sohn finds a little intuition comes in handy, too. "I talk to people on the ground," he says.
Wall Street gave up early gains and closed mostly lower Friday after oil prices topped $75 a barrel for the first time, rising $1.48 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</br></br>The continued gains in oil, gold and bond yields are keeping inflation worries at the forefront, said Ken Tower, chief market strategist for Schwab's CyberTrader. Evidence of economic growth in next week's reports will renew the debate over when the Federal Reserve might stop nudging up the overnight rate.</br></br>"The Fed is going to have a hard time stopping their increases if the economy seems to be gaining strength," Tower said. "I think the Fed will have a very hard time talking down the inflation hawks if the data comes in stronger than expected."</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.56, or 0.04 percent, to 11,347.45, building on Thursday's performance that was its best close since reaching 11,351.30 on Jan. 20, 2000. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.18, or 0.01 percent, to 1311.28. The Nasdaq composite index fell 19.69, or 0.83 percent, to 2342.86.</br></br>The major indexes ended the week with gains, mostly from the big advance Tuesday after minutes of the Fed's late March meeting showed the central bank was looking for signs that it could stop its interest rate increases. Inflation data released in subsequent sessions and oil's ascent stifled the market's enthusiasm, but the Dow still rose 1.88 percent for the week, while the S&P 500 rose 1.72 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 0.72 percent.
WASHINGTON -- Wholesale prices in July jumped by the largest amount in nine months, boosted by a surge in the cost of cars and energy.</br></br>But economists expressed little concern that the higher prices producers are paying signal broad inflation.</br></br>The producer-price index for finished goods rose 1% last month, the Labor Department said. The index was flat in June.</br></br>Much of the overall monthly increase reflected a 4.4% rise in energy prices, led by a 10.9% jump in gasoline prices and a 3.7% rise in the cost of natural gas.</br></br>The reported rise in wholesale prices contributed to a sharp oil- price drop on commodities markets yesterday, amid concerns that the two-year surge in prices could finally be cutting into demand for petroleum products like gasoline. Crude-oil futures for September delivery settled at $63.25, down $2.83, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
After working since the credit crisis to push back the time at which their debt comes due, American corporations are now taking on more short-term risk.</br></br>Concerns that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to dial back the flow of easy money has pushed up the cost of borrowing longer-term funds in recent months. But since the Fed hasn't actually moved to raise interest rates and isn't expected to for a while, short-term funds remain incredibly cheap.</br></br>That gap has created opportunities for some companies to borrow more short-term cash to buy back stock, help fund acquisitions, or pay off longer-term debt. Other companies are entering into derivatives deals with banks to get more exposure to floating interest rates, or to profit from a widening gap between short and long-term rates.</br></br>The bet is that rates will remain low enough and markets liquid enough that companies will be able to keep borrowing when their short-term loans come due. It is a pretty safe one, given that the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark interest rate close to zero for at least another year. Still, the moves highlight the distortions that have been created by the central bank's deep intervention into the markets.</br></br>Before the downturn, companies typically funded a lot more of their needs with short-term borrowings. During the financial crisis, when banks were in trouble, short-term borrowing costs for many borrowers spiked and parts of the credit markets nearly came to a standstill. Some companies moved to reduce their reliance on commercial paper and short-term IOUs due to concerns that these avenues of funding could freeze up during times of market stress. And as the Fed pushed interest rates to rock-bottom lows and bond yields fell, companies issued more bonds and longer-term loans, locking in low rates for years.
A steep stock-market plunge in July, the threat of war with Iraq, a sputtering economy and a series of corporate-accounting scandals all combined to slow the pace of securities underwriting in the third quarter.</br></br>Global underwriting volume fell 12.6% to $774 billion in the quarter from the third quarter of 2001, which was itself hard hit by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, according to Thomson Financial, which tracks securities transactions. But some Wall Street executives say they have seen some signs of a pickup in the past few weeks, since the passage of the attacks' first anniversary.</br></br>The impact of events in the third quarter was even more severe on disclosed underwriting fees, a more-telling barometer for Wall Street. Fees fell 21% to $2.31 billion amid a falloff in more-lucrative stock deals, such as initial public offerings. The tiny number of just seven IPOs by U.S. issuers in the quarter was the lowest since the first quarter of 1980, noted Richard Peterson, chief market strategist at Thomson Financial.</br></br>"My sense is that corporate America was very distracted in the third quarter," particularly by the mandate for chief executives to certify their companies' financial results to the Securities and Exchange Commission by mid-August, said Jay Chandler, head of equity syndicate at Merrill Lynch & Co. "Strategic discussions slowed down dramatically, and financing discussions almost came to a standstill," Mr. Chandler added.</br></br>Jon Anda, co-head of global capital markets at Morgan Stanley, attributed the 43% dropoff in the U.S. volume of equity and equity-linked securities issuance in the quarter partly to the stock-market decline. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down about 18% for the quarter, "and you don't find many quarters like that," Mr. Anda said. (The S&P 500 was off 13.7% in the second quarter.) "It was a very difficult quarter. We would all like to see this as a market bottom, but a bottom has been elusive."
WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady met with Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to try to reassure international financial markets, particularly after recent sharp declines in the Tokyo stock market and in the yen.</br></br>In a joint statement after their meeting, the two financial leaders said that they "reaffirmed their commitment to economic policy coordination, including cooperation in the exchange markets."</br></br>In recent weeks, Japan and, to a lesser extent, the U.S. have intervened in foreign exchange markets to try to hold down the stronger dollar and prop up the weaker yen. But in briefings after the meeting, U.S. Treasury officials didn't outline any further specific steps the two men had agreed on during their five-hour talk Friday in Los Angeles.</br></br>Mr. Brady and Mr. Hashimoto met prior to a gathering of financial leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries April 7 in Paris. The so-called G-7, which includes the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada, strives to coordinate those nations' macroeconomic policies.</br></br>In their Friday discussions, the two men covered a variety of issues, including a proposed capital increase for the International Monetary Fund; continuing talks on barriers to the bilateral economic relationship; and the planned European Bank for Reconstruction & Development, which will lend to emerging democracies in Eastern Europe.
Monday, Oct. 29</br></br>The Commerce Department is scheduled to report on personal income and spending for September.</br></br>Tuesday, Oct. 30</br></br>The S&P/Case-Shiller homeprice index for August is due.</br></br>---
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>A TABLE accompanying an article on Friday's Home Front page incorrectly referred to the time frame for data on home appreciation. The correct time frame is the period from the first quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1997. In that period, home values in Modesto, Calif., rose 1.8%, while home values rose 2.2% in Stockton, Calif., and 2.5% in Vallejo, Calif. The table incorrectly stated that home values in those areas fell last year. (WSJ March 9, 1998)</br></br>This may seem like a flashback, but it isn't. Burt Reynolds is a movie star again. Your friends are wearing Lacoste. And your home is showing significant appreciation.</br></br>Home values rose 4.9% in 1997, well above the nation's average inflation rate of 1.7%, according to an index that tracks repeat home sales compiled by mortgage buyers Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That means U.S. home prices have climbed faster than inflation for three straight years. The country hasn't seen such good news on the housing front since the late 1980s.</br></br>Perhaps the biggest surprise in the index was the gain posted by Flint, Mich., a gritty factory town of about 430,000 whose economic woes were chronicled in the quirky 1989 documentary "Roger & Me." With auto makers hiring again, Flint's housing prices jumped 25% last year. The median home price in Flint was $102,845, up 64% from 1990.
Not since Herbert Hoover has a party out of power had such an opportunity to run against everything that troubles the American family -- prices, interest rates, unemployment, taxes, or the fear for the future of their old age or the future of their children -- than is now presented to the Republican Party.</br></br>The Republicans, however, haven't figured this out. This is their basic problem. They have no strategy for defeating an Obama administration that is highly vulnerable on both domestic and foreign policy.</br></br>That's the conventional wisdom in a nutshell, isn't it?</br></br>It will come as no surprise that these words appeared in a Feb. 29 column in the New York Times. They are reproduced here exactly as written, save for one small adjustment.</br></br>The president whose failings they describe is Jimmy Carter, not Barack Obama. The lines were written in 1980, not 2012. The author was the then-dean of conventional wisdom, James "Scotty" Reston. The headline was "Jimmy Carter's Luck," a reference to Reagan's victory in the New Hampshire primary three days earlier.
The stock market broke out of its Monday meltdown syndrome as prices advanced in moderate trading yesterday.</br></br>After a brief drop of about 25 points as trading got under way, the Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed course. The average recovered all of its early losses by midday and climbed pretty steadily throughout the rest of the session, ending 20.56 higher at 2014.09.</br></br>Two weeks ago yesterday, the stock market crashed as the industrial average suffered its biggest drop ever, 508 points. After a brief recovery that week, the average tumbled nearly 157 points last Monday. But it moved higher during the rest of the week and again yesterday, gaining a total of more than 220 points.</br></br>Yesterday's advance went beyond the blue chips, but it wasn't as broad as Friday's move. Yesterday, gainers on the New York Stock Exchange had less than a 2-to-1 lead over losers; Friday, they led by an overwhelming 8-to-1 margin.</br></br>Trading activity finally slowed after the surge in the past two weeks. Big Board volume fell to 176 million shares from 303.4 million Friday. It was the slowest day since Oct. 13, when 172.9 million shares changed hands.
By some measures, the maker of the popular video game "State of Emergency" has one of its own.</br></br>Take-Two Interactive Software last month restated earnings downward for seven consecutive fiscal quarters, disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating its accounting practices and announced its chief financial officer's resignation after two months on the job for "personal reasons." A little later, the New York company, which makes video games, said there was an error in a portion of its restated earnings.</br></br>The reaction from Wall Street? Numerous analysts praised the company, and investors have bid up its stock 8% since Take-Two made its announcement.</br></br>An anomaly in a market that supposedly is more attentive to accounting issues in the wake of the alleged accounting irregularities at collapsed Enron? Not really.</br></br>Take Hanover Compressor, a company with similar problems. It said last month that it, too, would restate lower seven quarters of earnings, that the SEC is reviewing its accounting for a partnership, and that it also had appointed a new chief financial officer. But the company's stock has soared 27% since breaking the news. Moreover, although the company recently lowered 2002 financial targets, analysts have become even more bullish about the stock.
NEW YORK -- Investors behind the day's most notable options trade bet that Bank of America Corp.'s stock can stage double-digit percentage gains this fall.</br></br>Shares in the Charlotte, N.C. bank fell as much as 2.2% ahead of a much-awaited speech by Chief Executive Brian Moynihan. But investors behind this options move used the occasion to ramp up a bullish bet.</br></br>Specifically, they traded in 70,000 $14 Bank of America September call options to buy the same number of November $15 contracts.</br></br>A call conveys the right to buy shares at a fixed price some time in the future, and typically signals bullish intent.</br></br>Traders who move up a dollar in strike price are able to pay less money for their new bets and also signal higher expectations for the stock.
This week, President Clinton proposed spending more than $1.5 trillion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 - an amount equal to 21.6 percent of what the administration forecasts the nation's gross domestic product will be.</br></br>That would be the smallest the government would be in relation to the economy since 1979. It hit a post-World War II record of 24.4 percent in 1983 and has since declined to 22.3 percent.</br></br>However, the chart at the right shows another way to measure the government's demands on the economy: How much it spends for goods and services that it itself consumes and invests.</br></br>By this measure, the size of government in the current fiscal year will be about 6.7 percent of GDP, the smallest share since 1948. Under the proposed budget, it is slated to fall to 6.4 percent next year.</br></br>What the chart shows is that the bulk of federal spending involves transfer payments of various kinds rather than consumption of part of the nation's production. That means that the recipients of the transfers - people, institutions and other levels of government - rather than the federal government actually spend the money buying goods and services.
HONG KONG -- After years of gradually increased pressure from foreign brokerage houses, Taiwan in June invited a few of the world's biggest securities companies to compete for the chance to participate in its booming local financial markets.</br></br>The invitation list was so exclusive that the three spots open to foreigners were limited to the top seven U.S. and top four Japanese securities companies.</br></br>When the application period ended this week, only two companies had applied: Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</br></br>None of the "Big Four" Japanese securities companies applied because Japanese government officials made it clear that they didn't want to risk further damage to their relationship with Taiwan's archenemy, China, company executives say.</br></br>About 10 U.S. and European securities companies, including Merrill Lynch and Shearson, already have advisory offices in Taiwan, although no foreigners are currently allowed to participate in the stock market. The other U.S. firms invited by Taiwan weren't prepared to immediately make the kind of commitment the Taiwanese government wanted, according to brokers in Taipei.
More Trials Expected</br></br>For Great Lakes States</br></br>WHICH REGION will suffer most in the next recession? Data Resources says it's the same one that got stung worst in the last four economic downturns: the Great Lakes states.</br></br>The Lexington, Mass., economic-consulting firm has produced a scenario that assumes a relatively severe recession starting in late 1989, with the nation's economic output falling four percentage points by the fourth quarter of 1990 and interest rates surging. In this model, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin would lose 10% of their manufacturing jobs by the end of 1990.</br></br>Does all this sound familiar? In the major recessions of 1975 and 1982, and in the less severe slumps of 1960 and 1970, the Great Lakes states also sustained the biggest percentage job losses of any region.
Conde Nast Publications Inc. absorbed nearly two decades of losses at the New Yorker. On Monday, it pulled the plug on Portfolio magazine after less than two years.</br></br>The closure of the monthly business glossy shows how profoundly the advertising downturn has shifted the paradigm at Conde Nast, a publisher with a reputation for operating less out of concern for profit than the cachet its slate of prestigious titles conferred. The recession has accelerated the erosion of advertising across print media, including at Conde Nast's newspaper and magazine properties that for years helped prop up its unprofitable but respected titles. Executives at Conde Nast determined the next 18 months will be too difficult to continue investing in Portfolio.</br></br>"Editorially, we were proud of the product and the team that produced it," said David Carey, group president of a collection of Conde Nast titles that includes Portfolio. "But our timing, in terms of building an advertising franchise, proved to be terrible."</br></br>That Si Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast's parent, closely held Advance Publications Inc., and perhaps the biggest champion of its most prestigious titles, was willing to cut his losses with a publication in which he was so heavily invested could signal more dramatic change both at his publishing house and others.</br></br>A spokeswoman for Conde Nast, publisher of titles including Glamour, Vogue and Vanity Fair, said, "At this time, we do not foresee further changes to our lineup of titles."
Author: Kathy Chen</br></br>WASHINGTON--The U.S. trade deficit with China in June hit its highest level in nearly two years and could spur congressional pressure on Beijing to revamp its currency policy.</br></br>America's trade deficit with China jumped 17% in June over the previous month to $26.2 billion, the biggest gap since October 2008. Earlier this week, China said its overall trade surplus hit $28.7 billion in July, an 18-month high.</br></br>The Commerce Department figures could set the stage for a fight in Congress this fall over China's currency policy. Some lawmakers, arguing that China has set the yuan artificially low to make its exports more price competitive on global markets, are keen to pass laws that would penalize countries that are found to be manipulating their currencies.</br></br>China, under pressure from the U.S. and other countries, announced a shift to a more-flexible exchange rate in June. But the yuan has appreciated less than 1% since then, and some economists say that it remains undervalued against the dollar by at least 25%.
The Washington metropolitan area's economy stumbled slightly in February, but promises to turn in a positive performance for the first quarter and the rest of the year, according to the Greater Washington Research Center.</br></br>The Research Center said that indicators that measure the economy's current health weakened in February, in part because of poor weather but also because "the economy is not strong enough to keep driving ahead at an increasing rate," according to Steve Fuller, an urban affairs specialist for George Washington University who tracks the local economy for the center.</br></br>Fuller added, however, that the center's leading indicators, which forecast growth approximately six months into the future, were all stronger in February than a month before. It was the first time in 11 months that all the leading indicators were positive, he said.</br></br>Despite weakness in February and continuing bad weather into the spring, the Washington area economy appears to have turned in a positive performance for the first three months of the year, according to Fuller. Early data indicate that installation of basic business telephone service was up 37 percent from a year earlier, with most of the growth in Northern Virginia. Housing sales were up slightly, despite worse weather this year than last, Fuller said, and employment more than doubled in the first three months of 1993 over a year earlier. Unemployment in March was 4.4 percent, compared with 5.3 percent a year earlier, he noted.</br></br>Fuller said that data on employment appears to suggest that jobs are being created in start-up enterprises or by area residents becoming self-employed.
WASHINGTON -- The Agriculture Department warned U.S. consumers to brace themselves for a double jolt of food-price inflation this year and next because of the Persian Gulf crisis.</br></br>Energy-price increases stemming from war jitters and the international embargo against Iraq already are beginning to drive up costs of growing, processing and distributing food, the department said. Most of the oil-price shock in the food sector, however, is expected to be felt in the first half of 1991.</br></br>Department analysts said they expect food prices to average 5% to 7% higher this year than in 1989, a two percentage-point jump from the department's December 1989 prediction. The increase reflects not only the economic repercussions of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait but also unrelated double-digit price increases on fresh fruit, pork, eggs and dairy products in the first half of 1990. Last year, food prices climbed 5.8%, the sharpest increase since 1981.</br></br>The food-inflation forecast for 1991 won't be issued until November, but department analysts projected that oil prices alone will boost food prices 1% to 2% next year, primarily through higher transportation costs. However, they added that a further economic slowdown would relieve some of the upward pressure on food prices.</br></br>At the same time, problems are brewing in the Farm Belt. Department analysts project a $1.7 billion jump in farm production costs if crude oil prices remain at $30 a barrel through 1991, and a $2.6 billion jump if oil hits $40 a barrel. Although farmers could find some savings by changing their production practices, net farm income is likely to drop in 1991, they said.
Foreign-exchange traders, who have been divided the past couple of weeks about whether the U.S. dollar would weaken or strengthen, now appear convinced that the currency is once again headed upward.</br></br>Their view was reinforced yesterday when, despite the absence of the U.S. and Canada from the currency market for the Labor Day holiday, the dollar soared in European trading to 2.9120 West German marks, the highest level since Aug. 7, when the dollar hit an 11-year high of 2.9255 marks in New York.</br></br>"This new pattern of strength will be carried over into the U.S. when trading resumes (today)," said Ronald H. Holzer, an assistant vice president and chief dealer of Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago. Mr. Holzer said the dollar took off yesterday after rising through a technical resistance point at 2.8940 marks. Stronger Eurodollar interest rates and expectations of rising U.S. interest rates, which make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, were responsible for the general dollar strength, he added.</br></br>At the London afternoon gold fixing yesterday, gold declined to $344.50 an ounce from the morning fixing of $346.20 and from the Friday close of $348.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Traders said the dollar's strength in Europe was responsible.</br></br>In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $344.25 an ounce.
DAIMLERCHRYSLER AGREED with Aerospatiale Matra to combine their aerospace businesses and create the world's No. 3 aircraft and defense company.

Still, shares eased on worries that momentum might slow and concern about labor costs.</br></br>---</br></br>Retail sales rose just 0.1% in September, cooling after two months of blistering growth. Prices of imported consumer goods rose a sharp 0.3%, though, fueling some inflation fears.
Black America, with a 17.8 percent unemployment rate in December and 35.6 percent of its people below the poverty line, remains ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½buried in a depression of crushing proportions,ï¿½Û and the Reagan administration bears substantial blame, National Urban League President John E. Jacob charged yesterday.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The state of black America is disastrous,ï¿½Û said Jacob in releasing his organizationï¿½Ûªs annual report on the status of the nationï¿½Ûªs 28 million blacks.</br></br>He was especially critical of administration cuts in social programs over the last three years, its opposition to affirmative action in civil rights and the recent report of the Presidentï¿½Ûªs Task Force on Food Assistance that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½played downï¿½Û the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½serious problem of hunger in America.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The black poor have been relegated to an out-of-sight, out-of-mind status in American life,ï¿½Û said Jacob.</br></br>To obtain relief, Jacob said, blacks must turn out heavily enough in the coming election to force the president and Congress to heed black demands for jobs, restoration of social services and strengthening of civil rights enforcement.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢ Economic status. The black unemployment rate was 17.8 percent in December, compared with 8.1 percent for the nation as a whole; for black males aged 18 and 19, the rate hit 42.7 percent last fall. These official figures leave out workers too discouraged even to look for jobs.
A witches' brew of events, from growing turmoil in markets in Southeast Asia to an overvalued U.S. market and fund managers trying to lock in profits, wreaked havoc on Wall Street yesterday.</br></br>"We've got a global market swoon going on here," said Bruce Steinberg, a Merrill Lynch & Co. economist, of the 7.2 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 7161.15. "Asia hit a wall. And that transmits to the rest of the world." "It's a one-way market right now -- and that way is down," said Steve Roach, a Morgan Stanley Group Inc. economist. "We're in a mini-panic. There aren't a lot of natural forces of stability."</br></br>But economists were quick to caution that the panic was not justified by activity in global markets. "Events in Asia mean that growth is slowing, but not that it's stopping," Steinberg said. "The worry here has been that growth was too fast."</br></br>Roach, who just returned from two weeks in Asia, said the importance of events there to U.S. markets has been overblown. "The numbers show that if there's a real slump in Asia, our GDP {gross domestic product} will be off one-fourth of a {percentage} point," he said.</br></br>Some analysts have argued for months that the prices of U.S. stocks were overvalued compared with their earnings, and that the market wouldn't sustain them. After yesterday's plunge, they said that many companies' values were close to where they should be.
When Federal Reserve policymakers meet next week to decide whether economic growth is so strong that they should raise short-term interest rates once more to try to slow it down, one piece of evidence they will be looking at is what hapnened to retail sales in November and December.</br></br>The sales figures reported earlier this month by the Bureau of the Census were completely at odds with what most analysts had expected and with the picture of continued rapid economic growth painted by most other recent statistics. No one quite knows whether to believe them.</br></br>up only 0.2 percent in Novemberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rather than the 1.2 percent it had estimated in its first report last monthï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and that sales dipped 0.1 percent in December.</br></br>Is this the leading edge of the long-predicted slowing of growth? Or is it just a temporary flattening of an upward trend? After all, the retail sales numbers make up an extremely volatile series that is frequently revised by significant amounts.</br></br>The chart at the right underscores just how much the figures are revised as Census moves through three monthly stages of reporting the sales on what.it calls the advance, preliminary and final bases. Even the so-called final figures are subject to later revision.
Economic growth slowed significantly in the second quarter while wages increased at the fastest pace since the early 1990s, the government reported yesterday. The news led to a sell-off on Wall Street as investors feared the Federal Reserve was more likely to raise interest rates again.</br></br>At first glance, the slowing in the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product from its 4.3 percent clip in the first three months to 2.3 percent in the spring appeared to be a development that would satisfy Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who has been counting on a chilling of the economy to forestall the need for any further increases in interest rates.</br></br>But financial markets passed over that possibility and instead focused on a 1.1 percent increase in the employment cost index (ECI), a broad measure of wages and benefits. The index rose at a rate greater than the 0.8 percent analysts had expected--and raised the specter of inflationary pressures increasing in an economy that already is experiencing the tightest labor market in decades.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 180.78 points, to 10,791.29, as investors worried that the markets' benign environment of strong economic growth and weak inflation was undergoing a sea change. The technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index slumped 65.83, to 2640.01, and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 24.37, to 1341.03.</br></br>The bond market also soured on the news, with the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond falling $7.81 per $1,000 in face value and the yield rising to 6.07 percent, from 6.00 percent on Wednesday.
Maryland motorists who suffer from sticker shock every time they fill their tanks routinely look for the cheapest fuel they can find. But they don't find much difference in prices from one station to the next -- or at least not as much difference as they found a few years ago. The reason lies in a fascinating tale of Annapolis favoritism.</br></br>The story begins with the 2000 spike in oil prices, which caused gas prices to soar. Consumers responded by avoiding traditional service stations and buying lower-priced gas from chains such as Sheetz and Wawa. The two convenience chains were expanding into Maryland at the time, and several grocery stores and shoppers clubs also were opening gas stations to attract customers. The sight of motorists queuing up at these retailers worried the owners of traditional service stations, who appealed to state lawmakers for help. Annapolis has a history of restricting price competition to protect politically connected businessmen, so their call did not go unheeded.</br></br>The result was legislation to prohibit retailers from selling gas below state-established minimum prices derived from weekly wholesale prices. The legislation also empowered the state comptroller to investigate reports of illegally cheap gas and gave the comptroller the authority to suspend or revoke the license of any retailer caught offering low prices. The legislation's supporters said the new law was necessary to prevent "predatory pricing" in which one retailer undercuts competitors to drive them out of business and then raises its prices. But I've not heard of a single instance in which Sheetz or Wawa had engaged in predatory pricing, which economists generally considered to be unworkable.</br></br>Sheetz and Wawa fought the legislation, but in vain. It passed both houses of the legislature by overwhelming margins and was signed into law by Gov. Parris N. Glendening on May 18, 2001. The following September, Comptroller William Donald Schaefer sent letters to the editors of several Maryland newspapers proclaiming the legislation to be "good for the consumer" and assuring motorists that the new law would not cause gas price increases. When the law went into effect that October, Sheetz and Wawa promptly raised their prices.</br></br>What would Maryland gasoline prices be like if the minimum-price law were lifted? A loophole in the law gives an indication. A gas station can lower its price below the minimum "in good faith to meet competition." If Sheetz or Wawa tried to lower its prices to draw customers away from a nearby service station, that would not be legal competition, and the owner of a competing station could call the comptroller's office. But what if a Sheetz store were near a Wawa outlet and they wanted to compete against one another instead of calling the comptroller? In St. Mary's County, this is happening. As of April 18, one Wawa was selling regular unleaded for $1.99; the nearby Sheetz was selling it for $2. In response, the Texaco and Shell stations down the road were selling gas for $2 a gallon. In contrast, the statewide average gas price that day was $2.22 for regular unleaded.
NEW YORK -- Some of the best long-term records in the investment business belong to hedge fund managers, the gunslingers of Wall Street. But this year only a few are beating the market, and a fair number are losing money.</br></br>Hedge fund managers play both sides of the investment street. Catering to pension funds and wealthy individuals, the hedge funds "go long," buying stocks as conventional money managers do. They also "go short," making bets that certain stocks will decline.</br></br>It's a two-pronged approach rarely seen in the mutual fund arena, the small investor's domain. And it's no sure thing. Although the strategy is supposed to help hedge against the risk of a big market move in either direction, many of these "smart money" funds lately have been taking a lot of lumps.</br></br>Pure short-sellers are having a dreadful year, with the major stock-market averages up roughly 13%. Many heavily shorted stocks, far from declining, have risen 20% or more. Hedge fund managers aren't immune to the carnage. "I'm more long than short, but my shorts are killing me," says Walter Kass, who runs CK Partners, a New York hedge fund.</br></br>Managing to sidestep the damage were the hedge funds that either stayed mainly long or deployed exotic investment strategies. Essex Performance Fund was up about 20% in January and February, using a blend of 145% long and 25% short. (The total adds up to more than 100% because the fund borrows money in addition to what the clients put in.) "Some of it was luck," says Stephen D. Cutler, president of Essex Investment Management, the fund's parent. "We got in quite a bit of money at year-end 1990" and decided to put it to work on the long side.
With the economy strong and both inflation and unemployment low, why don't American workers feel better about it? Nearly three-fifths of those questioned in a Time Magazine/CNN poll last week said they did not "personally feel better as a result of the recent improvement of the economy."</br></br>Some analysts suggest that it is because workersï¿½Ûª standards of living are not rising noticeably. Many of the newly created jobs pay relatively low wages and often have few benefits, while people who have had jobs all along resent the fact that their incomes are barely keeping up with inflation.</br></br>that inflation-adjusted incomes are not going up, it's that consumers as a group have run out of ways to buy more goods and services even when their incomes are stagnant.</br></br>The chart at the right shows one important means U.S. households used in the 1980s to keep their consumption rising when their real incomes did notï¿½ï¿½ï¿½their current savings.</br></br>In the 1960s and 1970s, personal saving generally dipped to about 6 percent of after-tax income during economic booms and rose to 8 |>ercent or 9 percent when the economy slumped and saving for a rainy day became more popular.
Consumer prices rose by a mere 0.1 percent in July, indicating that the economy's recovery, however slow, will not be hampered by economists' bogyman, inflation.</br></br>* Any growth by businesses will be the result of increased productivity and not higher prices riding an inflation bubble.</br></br>"These numbers reflect the fact that growth is moderate," said Bruce Steinberg, manager of macroeconomic analysis at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "The things that you look for to tell you that inflation's coming back--they just ain't there right now."</br></br>July's 0.1 percent rise in the consumer price index, which is based on a monthly survey of the prices of more than 80,000 consumer goods, followed a month of no change in June and a 0.1 percent increase in May--the best three-month inflation performance in seven years.</br></br>In the first seven months of the year, consumer prices have risen at an annualized rate of 2.8 percent. Last year's inflation rate was 2.9 percent.
TOKYO -- Astellas Pharma Inc. said Tuesday it has agreed to obtain non-public information from OSI Pharmaceuticals Inc. in exchange for freezing its takeover attempt.</br></br>Japan's second largest pharmaceutical company by sales said it agreed to OSI's standstill provision prohibiting any attempt to buy OSI shares through May 15, shortening the standstill period to six weeks from the two years OSI had originally wanted.</br></br>The agreement keeps alive Astellas' hope to buy the U.S. cancer drug maker by allowing it to more accurately estimate OSI's value and make a fresh offer in as soon as six weeks. It also gives OSI more time to find a buyer willing to top the Japanese company's $52-a-share offer.</br></br>OSI's new stance on the non-disclosure provision comes after a recent recommendation by the company's board to management. Extending its takeover attempt could improve Astellas' chances to successfully acquire OSI. Analysts didn't see $52 as an attractive offer, considering the recent OSI share price of around $59 on the Nasdaq stock market.</br></br>With a more accurate evaluation of OSI and a fresh offer price, Astellas has a better chance of convincing OSI shareholders to tender their shares.
WASHINGTON -- Many of the eye-catching benefits for the middle class in the Senate tax-cut bill will phase out after a few years, while breaks for the rich tend to arrive late -- and stay.</br></br>The bill has been criticized as a legislative hall of mirrors, with benefits that often look bigger, or smaller, than they really are depending on when they take effect and for how long.</br></br>The basic reason for this: The Senate has been trying to cram most of the benefits of Mr. Bush's $1.6 trillion 10-year plan -- along with additional provisions aimed at pleasing middle-class voters -- into a much smaller, $1.35 trillion package. In order to do that, Senators had to push some benefits out to year 11, while starting others quickly, then stopping them after a couple of years.</br></br>Even some of the bill's most basic breaks arrive slowly. For example, income-tax rate relief begins immediately, but takes full effect only in 2007; estate-tax repeal, tax relief for married couples and the doubling of the child credit all become fully effective in 2011. A new $500 credit for student-loan interest takes effect in 2009. But a new deduction for college tuition abruptly ends after 2005.</br></br>"Ridiculous," said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy for Deloitte & Touche in Washington, referring to all the phase-ins and phase-outs. "The bottom line is they're stretching to do as much as they can."

The Labor Department said Friday that the U.S. jobless rate fell to 5% in June, the lowest since 2001. Federal tax revenues continue to rebound, at a nearly 15% annual rate so far this year, and economic growth continues to average nearly 4% despite $60 oil and rising interest rates. Maybe it's time to give the tax cuts of 2003 the policy credit they deserve.</br></br>More broadly, it's time to draw a few lessons from the fiscal policy debates of the Bush years. For we now know who was right, and who wasn't, going back to the proposals that were offered to restore growth after the dot-com bubble burst and through the 2001 recession and the aftermath of 9/11.</br></br>The big economic fight of the first Bush term was over fiscal policy, especially the size and design of tax cuts. The neo-Keynesians and believers in Rubinomics proposed temporary tax cuts through tax rebates to boost consumer spending. Jon Corzine, the point man on taxes for Senate Democrats, was insistent on the rebate idea.</br></br>Unfortunately, President Bush agreed, in part to get 12 Democratic votes in the Senate and in part because some of his advisers also fell for the Keynesian illusion that temporary tax cuts would spur growth. So he agreed to phase in his own marginal-rate income tax cuts over several years, while passing out $500 rebate checks immediately to American families in order to increase demand for goods and services. While this tax cut may have been a political success, it was an economic flop, as growth retreated again in 2002 after a one-time bounce.</br></br>The tax cut debate resumed in January 2003, however, as Mr. Bush decided to pursue a more supply-side course. This time he aimed his tax cuts directly at the collapse in business investment, proposing to eliminate the double tax on dividends and to accelerate his income tax cuts at the top marginal rates. House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas compromised on a 15% dividend rate but added a capital gains cut to 15% (from 20%).
NEW YORK -- The stock market retreated in lackluster trading, with renewed concern about interest rates and continued takeover activity marking an otherwise dull session.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has held steady just below the 2100 level since it closed at that plateau Sept. 14, slipped 5.51 to 2085.17.</br></br>Broader market measures were also weak. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.88 to 268.88, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index dropped 0.42 to 151.96. Also, 845 issues declined in price on the Big Board and 550 advanced.</br></br>Traders said the market's slide reflected weakness in the bond market, which took center stage in the absence of any fresh economic data and any obvious winner in Sunday night's debate between the two major presidential candidates, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis.</br></br>"It's just a directionless, trendless period right now," said Rodd Anderson, a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Interest rates and takeovers are the story."
Consumer spending dipped in April as shoppers were more concerned about their jobs than the easing of tensions with Iraq, increasing prospects that economic growth will be tepid at best in the second half of the year.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported yesterday that April retail sales fell 0.1 percent from March, when pent-up demand created by February's snow storms helped boost sales 2.3 percent.</br></br>"Consumers are tapped out," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economic officer at Wells Fargo & Co. "They've done a marvelous job of supporting the economy, but they are basically done . . . We need something else to pull up the slack."</br></br>A large portion of the overall sales decline came from consumers spending less on gasoline. Gas purchases fell 5.9 percent from late March to late April as gas prices slid by about a dime on average.</br></br>But shoppers also held back on their purchases of clothing, furniture and garden supplies because of uncertainty about holding on to their jobs or finding new ones, if necessary. The jobless rate is 6 percent today, compared with slightly over 4 percent a year ago. Consumers' hesitancy was a big factor preventing the postwar bounce that economists had expected.
The trouble with advertising is, frankly, that there isn't enough of it. Just in case you hadn't noticed, it's in a tailspin. Hey, this could be a catastrophe. Magazines and newspapers pay my bills. Advertising is their lifeblood (magazines get 50 percent of their revenues from ads, newspapers 80 percent). Is this the end of advertising? What about my future?</br></br>Almost everyone connected with advertising is in a funk. "Ad Biz May Never Be the Same," says a headline in Advertising Age. "Some veteran publishers are not shy about calling it {the ad decline} a depression," reports the industry newsletter MIN.</br></br>Here's why. In the first six months of 1991, ad revenues were down 14.4 percent at Newsweek, 18.5 percent at Business Week and 11 percent at TV Guide, reports the Publishers Information Bureau. Last week poor advertising caused Family Media Inc. to shut down its seven magazines, including Discover and Health.</br></br>Elsewhere in medialand, things aren't much better. Local and network TV ad revenues are off about 7 percent in 1991. Newspaper advertising was down in 1990 and also slipped 7 percent in the first quarter of 1991. Media company profits are being blitzed. The latest quarterly results are down 28 percent at Dow Jones & Co. compared with 1989, 87 percent at the New York Times Co. and 42 percent at The Washington Post Co.</br></br>Richard Harwood, ombudsman at The Post, speculates that a little adversity won't do the news business any harm. Maybe he's right. But how about a lot of adversity? Anyway, Harwood is near retirement, and he might feel differently if he worked at Family Media or for Psychology Today, New England Monthly, the National or California. They've all folded. In 1990, at least 20 magazines went belly up; the unofficial total so far in 1991 is 16, according to the Magazine Publishers of America. Some magazines are so desperate they're willing to slant stories to please advertisers, reports The Wall Street Journal. One health magazine reportedly offered to do a favorable story on two diet products for $25,000.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices rallied yesterday amid fresh signs of slower economic growth and an unexpected $2.1 billion drop in the nation's money supply.</br></br>Analysts say these developments increase the chances that the Federal Reserve System will keep its credit policy unchanged. Until recently, many investors had feared that vigorous economic activity and rapid money growth would prompt the Fed to tighten its credit hold and drive up interest rates.</br></br>The Commerce Department yesterday estimated that the economy is growing at only a 2.1% annual rate this quarter, down from a 4.3% clip in last year's fourth quarter. The department's preliminary, or "flash," estimate was well below the rate of about 4% that many analysts had been expecting.</br></br>Prices of some Treasury bonds rose almost 3/4 of a point, or nearly $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates declined. The economic and money-supply figures are "good news for the bond markets because they mean, at least for the short term, that there is no real threat the Fed is going to be cranking up interest rates," said Robert A. Brusca, a vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co.</br></br>Donald E. Maude, chief economist at Refco Partners, agreed that the figures "take a little pressure off the Fed" to tighten credit conditions. But he argued that all they do is "buy the Fed more time." He contended that the economy and money-supply growth will reaccelerate, forcing the central bank to adopt a tougher credit policy by late next month.
TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. -- DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler Group plans a major revamp of its manufacturing process that it hopes will shave billions of dollars off the cost of developing and producing cars over many years.</br></br>The move reflects how U.S. auto makers have begun to rethink basic assumptions about manufacturing cars and trucks as they seek a way out of the intense price war, and surge in overseas competition, that has sapped their North American profits since 2001.</br></br>Chrysler's new manufacturing process, which will be rolled out this fall at a plant in Belvidere, Ill., that is among the company's biggest money-losers, is intended to allow the flexibility to build three or more completely different models of cars in a single plant. Typically, U.S. auto makers produce one or two types of vehicles per plant. The idea behind the retooling is to improve the odds of a plant operating at close to maximum capacity -- a big key to profitability in a capital-intensive industry like autos.</br></br>Chrysler has been making money this year, thanks to the success of a line of three similar models -- the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Magnum and Dodge Charger, all of which are built at one Canadian plant. But amid heavy competition, it still faces pricing pressures similar to those being felt by rivals General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. Both GM and Ford have been slashing prices to move cars and trucks off their lots, a strategy that has boosted sales but hammered profit margins. Yesterday, the two introduced new strategies for emphasizing low sticker prices.</br></br>The long-term challenge for Detroit's car makers remains ending the cycles of overproduction and binge-discounting that have characterized the U.S. market since 2001, and better matching production to shifting consumer demand. In recent years, Detroit has invested too heavily in vehicles that consumers didn't end up wanting in huge numbers.
THE GROUP OF SEVEN reaffirmed its dollar-stabilization accord, but in such vague terms that the market may become more volatile as traders try to push the dollar higher. U.S. officials tried to damp such speculation, insisting the seven big industrial powers want to keep the dollar in the same trading range.</br></br>Argentina bypassed the IMF and announced an economic reform program aided by a $1.25 billion World Bank loan. The move comes amid a dispute between the U.S. and the IMF's managing director over how to handle the world debt problem.</br></br>---</br></br>Interest rates are expected to rise in the next few months because the economy is still growing vigorously, a Wall Street Journal survey of economists says. Several Fed members leaned toward tighter credit at the August policy meeting.</br></br>Durable goods orders surged 6% in August, mainly due to a rebound in the volatile transportation sector. Orders slid a revised 7.4% in July.
Con-way Inc. used to spend $500,000 a month on advertisements seeking drivers for its fleet of 2,950 long-haul trucks. Now, the company spends less than half that amount.</br></br>For years, a shortage of drivers was the single biggest problem for the trucking industry. Con-way, J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. and other companies spent millions of dollars annually trying to attract applicants for a notoriously unappealing job that involves spending weeks on the road, sleeping in cramped cabs and showering at dirty truck stops. Annual driver turnover has routinely approached or exceeded 100%.</br></br>In the cut-throat competition to lure new drivers, companies offered everything from signing bonuses to letting drivers take their pets on the road.</br></br>Now, these trucking companies suddenly have more applicants than jobs, thanks to a recession-driven jump in applications from the ballooning ranks of the unemployed and a decline in the number of trucks on the road as freight volumes plummet. In January alone, the industry, which employs roughly 1.32 million people, lost 25,000 jobs, according to the American Trucking Associations.</br></br>Some companies say they are seeing a tripling or quadrupling of inquiries from types of people who have historically snubbed driving a truck. They include people laid off from hard-hit industries such as construction and auto-manufacturing. "I've never seen it like this in 24 years, I can tell you," said Herb Schmidt, president of Con-Way Truckload, the San Mateo, Calif., company's long-haul division.
Treasury bond futures prices neared five-year highs in heavy trading and crude-oil futures tumbled on prospects of a weakening economy and low inflation.</br></br>Expectations of further oil-price cuts and other factors have helped extend the 2 1/2-month-old credit market rally and spark broadening interest among investors. Increased buying by brokerage houses in bond futures yesterday reflected heightened public interest, analysts said.</br></br>Bond price gains eroded on cash markets after the futures market closed. "It makes you wonder if the market is overheated," one futures trader said.</br></br>Nevertheless, Treasury bond futures closed 1 7/32 higher at 79-29 for June delivery. "It's a market that's accelerating and it doesn't seem to need much new or good information to go higher," said James Florsheim, an analyst with Heinold Commodities Inc., Chicago. "There's euphoria" among traders holding contracts to take delivery of bonds, "and relative fear and depression from those who might want to sell," he said. Until the rally loses momentum, projecting its end is taking "potshots," he said.</br></br>Crude-oil futures fell 45 cents a barrel to $27.02 for July delivery amid eroding prices on the spot, or noncontract, market and talk that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' ability to support prices is weakening. Nonfinancial commodity futures generally reflected the deflationary oil-price environment yesterday, continuing to hover near 2 1/2-year lows, according to an index compiled by the Commodity Research Bureau.
In the increasingly bitter struggle over regulating financial markets, senior Republican lawmakers are coalescing around a blunt line of attack, warning that White House-backed legislation headed to the Senate floor would entrench rather than end federal bailouts of Wall Street.</br></br>The strategy aims to pit Republicans against the administration's financial overhaul without appearing to side with Wall Street. Elements of the critique focus on conditional language in the bill that might easily be made more definitive, and some Democrats have pledged to ensure no bailouts are allowed. But the charge is designed to score political points at a time when public anger about Wall Street bailouts remains high.</br></br>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Thursday that the legislation "is seriously flawed" and "would allow taxpayer dollars to bail out Wall Street banks."</br></br>With a showdown looming, Democratic leaders said Thursday they would bring the legislation to a floor debate next week, in essence calling Republicans' bluff. The Obama administration is reaching out to rank-and-file Republicans, hoping to win backers even as top GOP senators were hardening against the bill.</br></br>Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is among those leading the outreach. He has scheduled a Friday meeting with, among others, Sen. Orin Hatch (R., Utah), who complained the administration "just won't work with us." Part of Mr. Geithner's mission is to walk senators through the bill's details, including highlighting GOP-backed ideas in it.
The Republicans mention him much more often than the Democrats do. That's because the GOP is still running against him. But Jimmy Carter is experiencing a kind of renaissance. He has been reborn as what Time magazine called "our best ex-president." People who thought he was a disaster in the White House regard him as a model elder statesman.</br></br>The other day in New Jersey, where George Bush went to give a brush of the presidential wings to GOP Rep. Jim Courter's lagging race for the governorship, Republicans are again using Carter to frighten voters. If they vote for Democratic Rep. James J. Florio, voters are told they will bring back "the bad old days of Jimmy Carter"-with high interest rates, rampant inflation and malaise running over. Carter and Thomas H. Kean, the popular retiring Republican governor, are being cited as the main reasons to vote for Courter, a candidate of severely limited personal appeal, who, despite service in the Peace Corps and the Legal Services Corp., is too conservative for New Jersey.</br></br>Carter's presidency, through a combination of bad staff, bad luck and his obsessive-compulsive behavior over the Americans held hostage in Iran, ended sourly in 1981. And Democratic orators, calling the roll of their party leaders, often pass him by.</br></br>But in the last two years, Carter has come on as the class of the exes. He has demonstrated that he really is a Christian, that the piety that so often got on politicians' nerves is absolutely genuine. His activities bespeak a conviction that he truly believes he is his brother's keeper.</br></br>He went about humbly with hammer and nails to help build low-cost housing for an organization called Habitat. At a time when other politicians, except Ronald Reagan, who denied its existence, were talking about homelessness, the sight of Carter actually doing something about it went down well.
rIJEW YORK, Feb. 18 Wide-swinging individual issues gathered in a lot of attention today in a rising stock market.</br></br>; The market moved over_ a one-point range for the most part and closed moderately higher on balance, but some -- The Associated Press average of 60 stocks gained 50 cents at $3.14.00. It was up 20 cents yesterday. Most of the gain was centered in the industrial component which advanced 90 cents. The rails and utilities each were up 20 cents.</br></br>3,500,000	shares, one of the slower days of the past month. Yesterdayï¿½Ûªs total came to 1,740,-000 shares.</br></br>American Woolen issues were hard hit. The company reported a net loss of around nine and a half million dollars for last year. The preference stock fell 6% at 79 and touched a low of 75%. The preferred lost 3Y* at 81%. The common was down % at 16%.</br></br>Southern Pacific was at the top of the most active list off % at 41% after directors declared the regular dividend of 75 cents.
NEW YORK -- The euro eked out an advance against the dollar as investors turned modestly optimistic about the pace of the global economic recovery, despite lingering concerns over the euro-zone debt crisis.</br></br>Unconfirmed reports of strong Chinese export figures boosted currencies closely tied to global economic growth, while Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's cautiously optimistic tone on the U.S. economy also supported the rally.</br></br>But a late-afternoon slip in U.S. stocks threw cold water on the run-up in riskier currencies, and investors likely pared their euro holdings ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank, said Ron Leven, currency strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. The central bank isn't expected to increase its target rates. Still, investors will listen closely for details on how the bank is dealing with issues related to euro-zone sovereign debt.</br></br>As investors took risk off the table in late afternoon, the dollar hit an intraday low against the yen. The Japanese currency tends to strengthen when investors unwind bets on higher-yielding currencies.</br></br>By late afternoon in New York, the euro was at $1.1987, compared with $1.1947 late Tuesday in New York. The dollar was at 91.17 yen from 91.39 yen. The euro was at 109.28 yen from 109.18 yen. The U.K. pound strengthened to $1.4533 from $1.4426. The dollar weakened to 1.1478 Swiss francs, from 1.1527 francs.
Wholesale prices in March advanced at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.1 per cent, compared with a 0.7 per cent increase in February, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Food prices, which fueled more than half of the hefty February increase, are the major factor in the more encouraging March report. Industrial commodities, generally considered to be a more reliable indicator of future retail price patterns, rose 0.3 per cent in December, and 0.4 per cent in both January and February.</br></br>In an interview with The Washington Post earlier this week, Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We cannot go on having industrial commodities at wholesale rise at the rate of the last three months (December, January and February) and achieve the (2 to 3 per cent inflation) taregt.ï¿½Û</br></br>During the three months referred to by Stein, industrial commodities advanced at a 4.4 per cent annual rate. The March advance alone works out to an annual rate of 3.6' per cent.</br></br>Ip the four monthï¿½Ûªs including the latest report, the industrial commodity component increased at an annual rate of 4.2 per cent.
The International Monetary Fund agreed to provide a $30 billion rescue package aimed at restoring investor confidence in Brazil, the linchpin of a continent that is rife with financial trouble in this summer of unrest in world markets.</br></br>The unusually large loan is intended to forestall a possible default on Brazil's $264 billion public debt. It is also intended to insulate Brazil's vulnerable finances from the uncertainty of an October presidential election, in which left-wing candidates are both leading the polls and shaking the markets. The agreement represents a significant shift by the Bush administration, which had previously advocated a tough-love approach toward debtor nations and refused to back further aid to Argentina after it defaulted on its loans and scrapped its IMF-endorsed economic plan late last year.</br></br>The Bush administration's view has changed significantly in the last few weeks. Some analysts speculate that officials finally gave in to mounting pressure from U.S. bankers, who argued that a Brazilian default could devastate economies in Latin America and and have repercussions in the U.S. At a time when unrest in the U.S. stock market is threatening an economic recovery, the White House seems less inclined to take the risk that turmoil in Latin America might send ripples northward.</br></br>The Brazil agreement is the most significant evidence so far that the Bush administration, which came into office arguing that big-money bailouts merely encourage high-flying investors and irresponsible governments, is now embracing those emergency loans as one of the few tools it has to deal with emerging markets gone sour.</br></br>"Brazil has the right economic policies in place to maintain stability so that the economy can continue to grow," the Treasury Department said in a written release as Secretary Paul O'Neill flew home last night from a visit to Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina -- the crisis hotspots. "The United States stands ready to support Brazil as it continues to implement these policies."
They rank among Washington's largest and most well known businesses: Giant Food, Hechinger and the Dart Group family of Crown Books and Trak Auto. But the corporate offices of those retailing empires don't carry the area's most prestigious addresses.</br></br>For all of them, home is in Landover, an aging industrial area in central Prince George's County that is carpeted with warehouses, roadways and office parks.</br></br>Originally drawn to the community by its proximity to rail lines and abundance of open space, those corporations in recent years have substantially boosted their investments in the area and provided county officials with a major drawing card in their intensifying search for new corporate headquarters.</br></br>This spring, about 1,000 Giant employees will move into a glistening new $20 million office complex next to their current facility on Sherriff Road.</br></br>Shoppers Food Warehouse, a fast-growing food store chain that is majority-owned by the Dart Group, last summer unpacked into a new headquarters building in nearby Lanham.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board proposed new capital guidelines for banks that would give a boost to the market for asset-backed securities.</br></br>The Fed yesterday also approved a rule eliminating most of the restrictions, or "firewalls," separating the activities of banks and their affiliates that underwrite and deal in securities.</br></br>The capital guidelines are designed to spell out more clearly the amount of capital banks must hold when they sell securities backed by loans but, under the recourse agreement with the buyer, retain part of the risk of loss.</br></br>Asset-backed securities are formed by pooling groups of assets, such as small-business loans, and packaging them into securities for resale in the secondary market.</br></br>The proposal would provide the biggest break to banks that sell triple-A rated asset-backed securities. Currently, banks that sell those instruments are assessed an 8% capital charge on the security's full value. Under the proposed guidelines, the 8% charge would be applied to 20% of the value of their stake in the security, for an effective 1.6% capital requirement, the Fed said.
The Senate yesterday agreed to begin debate on the controversial natural gas price decontrol bill on Monday, with a key vote to recommit the bill to conference likely sometime later in the week.</br></br>Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) could not persuade opponents of the legislation to accept a fixed time for a vote, so there is still a possibility of a filibuster or other parliamentary delaying tactics.</br></br>President Carter is leading an all-out administration effort to win passage of the gas bill, which Carter has called a crucial test of the nation's will.</br></br>The legislation is opposed by an unusual coalition of liberal Democrats who oppose price decontrol. Republicans who oppose Carterï¿½Ûªs general policies and oil-state conservatives who regard the complex gas bill as worse for the gas industry than no bill at all.</br></br>Proponents were encouraged by an endorsement of the bill by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Mainc), the influential chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, who had opposed total deregulation of newly-discovered natural gas prices the last time the Senate voted on the issue.
Capital One Financial Corp. said yesterday that regulators have ended an agreement under which the company's internal controls were scrutinized by federal and state regulators.</br></br>The "memorandum of understanding" had been in place at the McLean- based issuer of credit cards since July 2002. It meant that the Office of Thrift Supervision and other regulators were taking a hard look at whether the firm had insufficiently guarded against financial and other risks during its rapid expansion over the past decade.</br></br>Under the 2002 agreement, the company was made to classify sub- prime loans -- those with high credit risk -- more conservatively and spend heavily on technology infrastructure, internal audits and contingency planning.</br></br>"We're back to normal conversations and interactions with our regulators," said Tatiana Stead, a Capital One spokeswoman, referring to the OTS, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions.</br></br>The day after the company announced the agreement, the price of its shares, which had been trading at more than $50, plummeted 40 percent, prompting worries among analysts that the additional regulation could crimp Capital One's growth. Since then, its share price has rocketed back up, closing at $69.60 yesterday.
Did the plunge in the stock market two weeks ago leave you wondering what to do? Did the subsequent days of roller-coaster markets make you even more confused? Many money managers claim to have the winning strategy. Of course, they disagree. Here are five who are staking big bucks on their predictions.</br></br>David W. Tice, president of David W. Tice & Associates, manages the Prudent Bear mutual fund, started in 1995, and the Prudent Global Income Fund, launched in 2000. They have a combined $1 billion under management. The Bear fund aims to profit from a market downturn by betting that U.S. stocks will fall, a strategy known as "shorting." The Global fund is structured to benefit from a weakening U.S. dollar and rising gold prices.</br></br>The recent downturn is proof that easy money has helped prolong a period of financial prosperity, says Tice, who thinks a stubborn bear market is likely settling in. Tice admits he has seen red in recent years; the Bear fund posted losses in 2003 and 2004 but has recorded modest returns since. He says he underestimated the willingness of mortgage lenders to do business with higher-risk borrowers. But as lenders begin to pay the price for those risky loans, Tice says he is bulking up on short positions on financial institutions, as well as other companies that depend on access to credit. "We think this could be a 10- to 15-year decline," he said.</br></br>David Poiesz, head of the growth-equity investment team at OppenheimerFunds, manages the $1.3 billion Oppenheimer Growth Fund and co-manages the $2.8 billion Oppenheimer Equity Fund.</br></br>Some investors, he says, have too much money invested abroad after chasing higher returns in emerging markets. He views the recent market turmoil as a healthy reminder of the risks overseas, and says U.S. investors might find safer options at home.
In the best report on the U.S. job market since last spring, the Labor Department said yesterday that a wide range of industries added workers last month and that the unemployment rate fell to 7.2 percent, the lowest since April. Those already on the job worked longer hours, reflecting increasing strength in the economy.</br></br>Analysts said the report was further evidence that the economy is gradually improving but stressed that the gains it showed were still well below those usually seen during recoveries from recession.</br></br>William G. Barron Jr., deputy commissioner of labor statistics, said the figures showed a "modest improvement in the nationï¿½Ûªs labor market.ï¿½Û</br></br>Robert G. Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago, said the report ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is consistent with the notion that we are on a subdued growth path. It was certainly positive. The workweek was a solid plus, and there werenï¿½Ûªt any real weaknesses.</br></br>Gene Sperling, a member of the Clinton economic transition team, said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's unquestionably good news but itï¿½Ûªs too early to tell whether job growth is coming back for real or not.ï¿½Û
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Small-capitalization stocks underperformed the overall market, and interest-rate-sensitive stocks led the way down.</br></br>Savings-and-loan stocks fell after fears of inflation and higher interest rates were fanned by news that consumer prices rose sharply in March. On the Big Board, Downey Financial fell $1.47, or 2.9%, to $48.85 a share. First Sentinel Bancorp slid 53 cents, or 2.6%, to 19.76, and Dime Community Bancshares sank 44 cents, or 2.3%, to 18.90.</br></br>The report of a jump in consumer prices, which came a day after strong retail-sales data, provides evidence of a strengthening economy. Some investors are concerned that a rise in inflation could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates this year, which could hurt stocks. "Looking ahead, investors will be watching for changes in the yield curve and interest rates very closely for signs that the long bull run in small caps may be starting to wane," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke.</br></br>The Russell 2000 Index of small stocks fell 3.81 points, or 0.65%, to 582.02, and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 Index slipped 2.05, or 0.72%, to 283.71. The Nasdaq Composite Index of large- capitalization and small-cap stocks sank 5.23, or 0.26%, to 2024.85.
President Obama didn't comment on Friday's report of declining growth in the second quarter, and that's no surprise. The economic story of his Presidency is by now familiar: a plodding recovery that has taken its third dip in three years and is barely raising incomes for most Americans.</br></br>"We're still in a position where we are pulling ourselves out of the very deep hole caused by the Great Recession, and there is still -- of course -- a great deal of anxiety in the country about the economy,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney. He's right about the anxiety, but if only we were "pulling ourselves out."</br></br>The reality is that the Great Recession ended three long years ago. In this Less Than Great Recovery, the economy shows promise for one good quarter then slows back down. As the nearby chart shows, this is the third straight year of sputtering recovery. Growth of 4.1% in the fourth quarter declined to 2% in the first and now 1.5% in the second. The stock market rose as investors bet that the lousy growth will inspire more Federal Reserve easing.</br></br>The sliver of good news is that private growth, which is what really matters, was up a slightly less anemic 1.8%, and government spending fell by a minus-1.4% from the first quarter. Housing is also now less of a drag on GDP. But this makes the paltry 1.5% growth more disconcerting, because it means that other parts of the economy are growing less rapidly than they ought to be.</br></br>Consumption ticked up only 1.5%, for example, down from 2.4% in the first quarter. This may reflect that wages and salaries are barely keeping pace with inflation. Another negative is that business inventories climbed unexpectedly in the second quarter, which often presages a decline in business spending in the next quarter to clear the shelves.
The soft blue glow of the computer screen, the tapping on the keyboard and the accompanying hardware hum will be my world for the next several hours - a world of self-imposed isolation and silence. Phones will not ring, nor doorbells chime. Kids will not interrupt. There's no laughter from a distant television or pounding beat from a stereo. The first intrusion I can expect will be the sound of a van pulling away from the mailbox after delivering my Washington Post at 5:10.</br></br>But by then I will have taken advantage of one of the most valuable untapped resources we have as a species: time. Specifically, nighttime.</br></br>To those who know my early morning ways, I am abnormal. Not in a deranged way, but in the "major percentile group" sense. And they are right. To them, I appear to have a sleeping disorder because my day begins between 3 and 4 a.m. and ends around 9 p.m. I readily acknowledge that I'm nowhere near the bulge in the bell curve of sleeping habits.</br></br>Despite the apparent eccentricity of it, there is great potential value in these predawn hours: value to the individual, to our companies and to our society. And yet, with all of our new technology and our burning desire to reinvent and reengineer our lives and our world, we seem to be letting our most precious resource - time - slip through our fingers.</br></br>Expensive revenue-producing, life-enhancing resources sit idle or near-idle in the darkness. Office buildings, computers, medical facilities, power plants, libraries, research centers, telecommunications networks, airplanes, trucks, educational facilities, golf courses, retail shops - almost everything - go from assets to liabilities as we, ironically, search for ways to do more with less and become more competitive.
YAHOO</br></br>Software Being Developed</br></br>For Mobile Content</br></br>YahooInc., seeking to improve its presence on mobile devices, is developing software that would help mobile applications deliver so-called personalized content, such as news and entertainment articles, that differs based on each user's interests, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>The initiative, which could be announced as early as the Mobile World Congress in event Barcelona, Spain, later this month, could be used to boost mobile apps created by Yahoo as well as those developed by third-party content publishers on smartphones and tablets, these people said.
STOCKS MANAGED to avoid a retreat following Monday's big gain.</br></br>Many investors had feared a pullback after stocks put in big gains on Friday afternoon and again on Monday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 213.21 points. Instead, the industrial average yesterday rose an additional 0.19%, or 18.70 points, to 9706.12.</br></br>That means that the blue chips now are up 445.13 points since hitting an intraday low of 9260.99 during trading on Friday.</br></br>"Considering the gains we had from the worst of Friday through Monday, it is a pretty positive sign that the market didn't give it back," said Larry Lawler, head of stock trading at New York mutual-fund group Dreyfus. "Now, the market is taking a pause and people are stepping back to see what shakes out and where we are headed."</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.09%, or 0.97 point, to 1037.14, leaving it down 10% this year. Technology stocks fell back, however, pulling the Nasdaq Composite Index down 0.67%, or 10.33 points, to 1542.96, down 21% so far this year. The Dow industrials are down 3% this year.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>Foreign investors increased purchases of U.S. securities in June for the first time in five months, evidence foreign demand is ample to sufficiently finance the U.S. current-account deficit.</br></br>Foreigners bought $71.8 billion in U.S. stocks and bonds in June, up from $65.2 billion in May, according to the Treasury Department. Analysts estimate $45 billion to $50 billion in foreign investment is needed each month to finance the U.S. current-account gap, the broadest gauge of the nation's global trade. It stood at a record $144.9 billion in the first quarter.</br></br>So far this year, foreign net purchases of U.S. securities are averaging around $75 billion a month, up from about $50 billion a month last year, analysts say. "Worries about the ability of the U.S. to finance its twin deficits -- the current-account deficit and budget deficit -- remain overblown," said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond-market strategist at Miller Tabak.</br></br>The June foreign-investment data exceeded financial markets' expectations that net purchases would be between $50 billion and $60 billion. "The dollar had a positive reaction simply because the number was better than most people expected," said Shahab Jalinoos, senior foreign-exchange strategist at ABN-AMRO.
The Japanese government announced today that the world's second-largest economy continued to shrink for an unprecedented fourth quarter in the three months that ended in September, despite a boost from government spending.</br></br>In addition, the government announced that for the first time in its history, the value of the national and local governments' debts will exceed the nation's total economic output at the end of this fiscal year.</br></br>"Basically there is no recovery in sight," said Yasuhiko Ushikubo, an economist with the Industrial Bank of Japan.</br></br>The United States and other nations have urged Japan to revive its economy as fears mount that Japan's woes could prolong economic turmoil in Asia and threaten the rest of the global economy.</br></br>Japan's gross domestic product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- contracted 0.7 percent in the July-September period, for an annual rate of 2.6 percent.
Computer Associates International taught investors an old, but important lesson yesterday: Fourth of July firecrackers are best enjoyed when you are not holding them when they explode.</br></br>The mainframe software firm lighted a fuse when it reported very late Monday night, actually just before midnight on July 4, that it would miss analysts' estimates for its fiscal first quarter ended June 30. It didn't provide full details in the late Monday announcement.</br></br>This wasn't your ordinary, miss-the-estimates-by-a-penny-type announcement. Instead of earning the 55 cents that analysts expected, the Islandia, N.Y., company anticipated earnings of 11 to 16 cents, it later disclosed in a conference call yesterday morning.</br></br>When the post-holiday markets finally opened, investors couldn't drop the stock fast enough. It plunged 43% to $29.375, down $21.75, in heavy 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading -- the largest percentage decliner on the Big Board.</br></br>Wall Street was fuming. Indeed, the market carnage underscores the sensitive issue of trust between a company and Wall Street investors. Credibility can get a company through a rough patch, keeping investors from bailing out, limiting the damage to a stock price on bad news, and buying senior executives time from boards that look to the stock price as a report card for management. All that is blown when a company throws the Street a nasty curve.
Wealth Two swallows don't make a consensus, of course, but scarcely a week after Jesse Jackson's Wall Street Project was in the news, the National Urban League launched a major push for black economic power.</br></br>Jackson's not-yet-fleshed-out idea is for black Americans to acquire stock in national and local corporations, thereby giving black America an insider's view -- and an insider's influence -- on the workings of the commercial marketplace.</br></br>The Urban League's equally inchoate notion is that it's time for black Americans to begin working at closing the wealth gap that can be expressed in this shorthand fashion: Black household income, according to one recent survey, is about 62 cents for every dollar earned by white households. When it comes to wealth, however, the black share is about 8 cents on the dollar.</br></br>"The wealth data expose far deeper inequalities {than the income gap}," Melvin L. Oliver and Thomas M. Shapiro wrote in the essay that was the basis for discussion at the Urban League's recent convention in Philadelphia. "Half of all white households have at least $6,999 in a {net financial assets (NFA)} nest egg, whereas nearly two-thirds of all black households have zero or negative NFA."</br></br>A couple of things worth noting: The essay is the lead article in the league's 1998 edition of "The State of Black America," an annual report that used to focus on how awful things were for black people and how white racism was to blame.
More than 60 percent of 388 American cities responding to a survey said unemployment was a high or top priority and the major problems were youths who lacked basic job skills and not enough jobs to go around, according to a report released yesterday by the National League of Cities.</br></br>Of those cities responding to the survey, 45 percent had unemployment rates exceeding 8.1 percent and 21.7 percent had rates of more than 10 percent, the report said. The national civilian unemployment rate in July was 7.5 percent.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Clearly there is a need to create more jobs," said Cleveland Mayor George V. Voinovich, first vice president of the group. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There still is not enough work to go around, and the economic recovery has been uneven in many cities still suffering from high unemployment."</br></br>Donald Fraser, mayor of Minneapolis and chairman of the leagueï¿½Ûªs task force on urban unemployment, said that 24 of 82 cities reporting unemployment exceeding 10 percent were in states generally from Illinois and Wisconsin through Ohio.</br></br>Only about one in five of the cities responding to the survey said unemployment was a top priority, while 26.5 percent said it was a moderate priority. About 42 percent said it was a high priority, the report said.
Call it Wall Street's other geopolitical driver, one played out not in Athens or Rome, but close to home in Washington.</br></br>As stock-market investors fret over sovereign-debt contagion in Europe, a Nov. 23 deadline for the U.S. Congress's so-called budget supercommittee is fast approaching. The committee is assigned to devise at least $1.2 trillion in deficit-reduction measures over 10 years, or else automatic cuts ordained by Washington's summer debt-ceiling agreement are triggered.</br></br>Friday's market action gave little hint that investors remain perturbed over Europe's debt situation, much less any happenings in Washington, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged by triple digits. But the gains came on the kind of light volume that usually suggests a lack of participation.</br></br>The outcome in Washington is a large unknown for the stock market, which is a creature vastly more wary of mystery than bad news. Bad news can at least can be analyzed and quantified. A large political unknown, by contrast, is all but sure to be a source of market volatility.</br></br>The underlying fear is that lawmakers' cuts are too small to persuade credit-rating firms to maintain their current ratings on U.S. government debt. If that happens, stocks could engage in a replay of their plunge in August, which followed Standard & Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. That action coincided with a surge of fears over Europe's sovereign-debt crisis.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Wall Street stock underwriters are taking a breakfast- buffet approach to the IPO market this year.</br></br>Last week marked the first big-volume push for initial public offerings of stock, with 11 deals raising $3.08 billion, according to data from Dealogic LLC in New York.</br></br>To date, there have been 17 IPOs, raising $3.73 billion. This time last year, there had been just one IPO, raising $26.3 million, according to Dealogic. The deals come from a range of industries, such as insurance, biotech, auto parts and retail. And this range of sectors is likely to continue throughout the year, assuming the economy and the markets continue to improve.</br></br>"In a broadly based strengthening economy that benefits a variety of sectors, you should have an IPO market with a diversity of sectors and names," said Marc Baum, managing director of Seaport Group, a broker- dealer in New York. Such diversity is also healthy, he said, given that "bubble" periods, such as the tech-stock boom of the 1990s, are often driven by momentum investors chasing a single sector.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Treasurys prices ended sharply lower, though well above the day's worst levels, on fears of less foreign demand for U.S. government securities.</br></br>Over the weekend, finance ministers of the world's seven largest industrialized nations called for "more flexibility in exchange rates . . . based on market mechanisms."</br></br>Asian central banks, notably the Bank of Japan and the People's Bank of China, have managed the valuations of their nations' currencies through covert market interventions and, in China's case, by a narrowly defined band. Bank of Japan interventions have involved buying dollars against yen, and many of the dollars accumulated through such purchases have been channeled into the U.S. Treasurys market.</br></br>Investors now fear that if the central banks were to refrain from buying dollars to keep their currencies weak, they would need to purchase fewer U.S. Treasurys.
First Monthï¿½Ûªs Performance Has Predicted the Marketï¿½Ûªs Direction Accurately Many Times Before. But Will It Do So Again This Year?</br></br>First Monthï¿½Ûªs Performance Has Predicted the Marketï¿½Ûªs Direction Accurately Many Times Before. But Will It Do So Again This Year? mhe overall trend of the market for the past three years has been set during January. So far in 1995, January again has been a good month.</br></br>NEW YORKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½Ûªs nail biting time on Wall Street as the stock marketï¿½Ûªs performance this month provides the "January barometerï¿½Û that is supposed to predict whether the year on Wall Street will be good or bad.</br></br>Yale Hirsch, publisher of Stock Traderï¿½Ûªs Almanac, said that the month of January has proved to be an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½incredibleï¿½Û forecaster of things to come for the rest of the year.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Nothing beats the January Barometer,ï¿½Û he said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Since 1950, no other indicator has predicted the annual course of the market with such accuracy.ï¿½Û
HARRY S TRUMANï¿½ÛªS life was an accident. All of it. Harry just sort of bumped into life, taking whatever was handed him by fate. He was a bank teHer, a farmer, a soldier, an oil and mining speculator, and then at the age of 37, he narrowly avoided bankruptcy after opening a fancy menï¿½Ûªs clothing store just in time for the recession of the early 1920s. Only then did he stumble into his true calling as a professional politician when a member of the infamous Pendergast political machine asked him, on a whim, if he was interested in running for a county judgeship.</br></br>This is the now familiar story of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½faded haberdasherï¿½Û who makes good as the "accidental" 33rd president of the United States. For much of his nearly eight years in the White House, however, Truman was ridiculed by the press and buffeted by numerous controversies and not a few petty scandals. By November 1951, his standing in the polls bottomed out at 23 percent. And yet, today his reputation is such that politicians from both parties openly attempt to emulate the straight-talking, no-nonsense demeanor of "citizen Truman."</br></br>Two years ago, one of our national storytellers, the sonorously voiced David McCullough, cashed in on the phenomenon with hi3 wildly successful, 1,117-page biography Truman. The book won a Pulitzer Prize and a slot on the bestseller lists for months.</br></br>Now comes Robert H. Ferrell with a far more modest 484-page portrait of Harry Truman. Why should we care? Hasnï¿½Ûªt McCullough said it all? Well, perhaps not Many historians were frustrated by McCulloughï¿½Ûªs refusal to engage with the historiography of the Truman presidency. In separate reviews, historians Alan Brinkley, C. Vann Woodward and Ronald Steel all complained that while McCullough was a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½great scene-setter and storytellerï¿½Û (Steel), he largely ignores historical controversiesï¿½Û such as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the vast revisionist literature on the origins of the cold warï¿½Û (Woodward), the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the founding of the CIA, the outbreak of the Korean War, and the phenomenal growth of the military budget during the Truman presidency. McCul- lough was guilty of hagiography, which may not be such a terrible crime for a biographer; but his work cannot be called critical history.</br></br>Ferrell also admires Truman, as much, if not more so, than McCullough. As an author or editor of eight previous books on Truman, including Off the Record: The Private Papers of Harry S Truman, Ferrell is probably as responsible as any academic for refurbishing Trumanï¿½Ûªs reputation.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market was mixed today as investors paused after a decline of the previous day and awaited news on the nationï¿½Ûªs money supply.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, down by about three points at one point in the session, was off just .94 at 925.37 at the close.</br></br>But gaining issues outnumbered losers by a margin of almost 7-to-4 among stocks listed on the New York Stuck Exchange.</br></br>Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues- including ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in over-the-counter market came to 28.15 million shares.</br></br>Analysts said the market showed disappointment over Wednesday's broad decline that spelled an end to a general advance in the market for the previous 11 sessions.
Hedge funds used to reek of exclusivity. They were run by the most cunning traders on Wall Street, who employed exotic trading techniques designed to make money regardless of whether markets rose, fell or stayed flat. Their clients included only the super- rich.</br></br>Hedge funds are now a $1 trillion industry. Millions of middle- class people invest in them through pension funds or mutual funds.</br></br>The Virginia Retirement System, for example, recently increased its investments in hedge funds to $1.6 billion, or close to 4 percent of its assets. The Baltimore City Fire & Police Employees' Retirement System put $80 million into hedge funds last year, while the City of Baltimore Employees' Retirement System invested about $55 million, or 5 percent of its assets.</br></br>Some experts say pension funds and university endowments are plowing money into the high-fee funds at the worst possible time. Investment returns have dropped, inexperienced managers are piling in and some sophisticated investors appear to be pulling money out. Hedge funds make -- and risk -- big money by making big bets, mostly with borrowed money. They bet on movements in multiple markets, whether it be in stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, options, derivatives or any combination of the above.</br></br>Estimates suggest that hedge fund trading can account for as much as half the daily volume on the New York Stock Exchange, though as with so much else in the lightly regulated hedge fund world, reliable figures are difficult to find.
John Steele Gordon's "The Little Miracle Spurring Inequality" (op-ed, June 3) is short on facts. For example, he could have cited figures showing how the share of the country's wealth held by the top 1% has gone from approximately 25% in 1981 to approximately 35% in 2010.</br></br>He could also have mentioned that the Gini coefficient, a broad-based, widely accepted measure of income inequality, for the U.S. was higher than in Sweden, Norway, Austria, Germany, Denmark, Austria, Italy, Canada, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Japan, Israel, Iran, etc.</br></br>I agree with Mr. Gordon that capitalism has benefited more people than any other widely practiced economic system. But the question is, "Have its benefits been fairly distributed?" I think not. Personally, I tend to agree with a recent pope who condemned what he called "rapacious capitalism." This is what it seems to me we now have in the U.S.</br></br>Bernard Schrautemeier</br></br>St. Louis
The meltdown of Bear Stearns Cos. in March marked the collapse of the modern securities industry, and the careers of some on Wall Street.</br></br>The financial crisis also claimed the life of a veteran Bear Stearns manager.</br></br>Barry Fox, a research supervisor who worked for nine years at the brokerage firm, took a drug overdose and then jumped from his 29th- floor apartment the evening in May after he learned he wouldn't be hired by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., which was about to buy his firm. A coroner recently confirmed in an autopsy report that the death was a suicide.</br></br>Mr. Fox was devastated by the implosion of Bear Stearns and the financial hit he was likely to face, says Fred Philippi, his longtime companion. After several personal setbacks, "this Bear Stearns thing happened to be the last straw that broke his spirit," Mr. Philippi said in an interview.</br></br>J.P. Morgan, which hired nearly half the firm's 14,000 employees, has taken pains to help Bear Stearns workers displaced by the merger. The bank paid severance packages to those who weren't hired and set up an outplacement service to help them pursue job opportunities. James Dimon, J.P. Morgan's chief executive, also asked some of his bank's key clients to consider hiring Bear alums.
INVESTORS FOUND MORE REASONS to buy stocks, as stronger-than-expected retail sales and weekly employment figures helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average back above 8500 -- and sent Treasury bonds sharply down.</br></br>Investors were emboldened by news that London-based banking group HSBC Holdings is acquiring consumer lender Household International. The takeover boosted confidence in consumer spending and in U.S. stocks.</br></br>"I don't think we are out of the woods, but the market has a better tone," said Robert Harrington, head of listed trading at brokerage firm UBS Warburg. The takeover "gives you confidence that if another company is willing to buy that business, maybe there is some value there, and maybe there is some value in other places that have been depressed."</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.7%, or 143.64 points, to 8542.13, now up 17% since hitting a five-year low Oct. 9. It still is down 15% this year and is 27% off its January 2000 record.</br></br>The 10-year Treasury note plunged 1 23/32, or $17.1875 for each $1,000 invested, as money shifted back toward stocks. The note's yield, which rises when price falls, jumped back above 4% to 4.047%.

But that doesn't mean the 27-year-old from Brookline, Mass., has no long-term savings plan.</br></br>Mr. Vogel, who does internal reporting and applications development at Children's Hospital Boston, brings his lunch to work and cooks dinner in order to offset weekend entertainment expenses. He buys frequent-skier cards at several ski resorts within a few hours of where he lives. And the avid sailor often rides as a crew member on yachts for which, as he says, his only financial outlay is the cost of a few beers.</br></br>"I have plenty of funds to have plenty of fun," says Mr. Vogel.
Sales of existing homes fell sharply in October as rising interest rates continued to take a toll on consumers. Nevertheless, sales remain brisk by historical standards and are on track to set a record this year.</br></br>In October, sales declined 6.6%, according to the National Association of Realtors, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.79 million units. That was down from September's 5.13 million rate and was 3% below the 4.94 million level set in October 1998.</br></br>"An increase in mortgage rates is translating into a slowdown in home sales -- exactly what the Fed wanted" when it raised interest rates three times this year, said Kory Bockman, an economist with the NAR in Washington.</br></br>Still, home sales are likely to top 5.20 million units this year, besting last year's 4.97 million mark and the fourth consecutive record year.</br></br>"It's still a good time to be a Realtor," said Mr. Bockman.
PARIS -- Vivendi Universal SA said it was considering an initial public offering of 25% to 30% of its U.S. entertainment businesses because of the rebound in stock prices, putting bidders looking at the assets on notice that it has other options should their offers be too low.</br></br>Vivendi raised the possibility of an IPO as it reported first-quarter earnings that showed declines at both its Universal Music Group unit and the U.S. television and film businesses it is auctioning.</br></br>Despite the weaker entertainment-business results, Vivendi's overall first-quarter figures were better than expected due to the strength of its telecom units. The company's net loss shrank to 319 million euros ($377.6 million) from 815 million euros a year earlier. Revenue dropped to 6.2 billion euros from 14.6 billion euros, although most of the decline was due to Vivendi's sale of its controlling interest in its utility arm last year.</br></br>Universal Music, the world's largest music company, swung to an operating loss of 28 million euros in the quarter. Vivendi Universal Entertainment, the TV and film venture being auctioned, had an operating profit of 213 million euros, down 23% from last year on a pro forma basis, which assumes the acquisition of USA Networks had occurred at the start of last year.</br></br>At least six potential buyers are expected to submit bids for some or all of Vivendi's U.S. entertainment assets on Monday, the deadline in what is likely to be the first round of a prolonged auction. Companies submitting bids are expected to include Liberty Media Corp., Viacom Inc., General Electric Co.'s NBC, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., a group of investors led by oil billionaire Marvin Davis and another group led by Edgar Bronfman Jr.
Stock markets ended a turbulent quarter on a sour note on Friday, with shares falling sharply amid investors' growing despair about political efforts to deal with the monumental challenges facing the world economy.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.16% on Friday, ending the quarter down 12%--its worst percentage decline since the first quarter of 2009. Stocks in Europe and Asia also fell.</br></br>The selloff capped a dismal quarter marked by anxiety about the European sovereign-debt crisis, a U.S. economy flirting with a double-dip recession, and signs that hitherto fast-growing economies such as China are slowing down. Even some famed safe havens failed to perform--gold tumbled toward the end of the quarter, and the Swiss franc also dropped.</br></br>"I'd like to forget all about it," said Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. "It was an ugly quarter, and it started right after the quarter began. There was a whole string of things. When the market might have wanted to go higher, something always seemed to come along to squash it."</br></br>The onslaught of bad news, coupled with periodic flashes of optimism, led to one of the most volatile periods ever for stocks. On Friday, the Dow plunged 240.60 points to 10913.38, after big gains earlier in the week. That was the 18th time the Dow moved by more than 200 points in the quarter. In August, it swung by more than 400 points in four consecutive days.
President Bush yesterday pledged to lead an international effort to help Nicaraguan President Violeta B. Chamorro restructure her nation's $365 million overdue international debt but offered no money beyond previous pledges.</br></br>"One way or another, together we will do it," Bush told Chamorro during a White House meeting yesterday morning, according to Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson.</br></br>Chamorro told Bush that Nicaragua's arrears with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) are "the most critical and difficult issue facing Nicaragua today," Aronson told reporters after the meeting.</br></br>"The president pledged strong and firm United States assistance to Nicaragua and made it clear that the United States, along with the World Bank, will lead an international effort," Aronson said.</br></br>Nicaragua must come to an agreement with the international lending institutions in order to be able to borrow more to cope with a collapsing economy. The IDB and the World Bank said in March that each is ready to commit $200 million in concessionary lending over the next three years if the arrears can be cleared up.
The Clinton administration, alarmed that the declining dollar threatens its hopes for the U.S. economy, led a 16-nation offensive to prop up the currency.</br></br>As Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen declared unequivocally for the first time that the dollar has fallen too far, the U.S. recruited allies ranging from Germany to Portugal to buy dollars in the most-coordinated show of force that currency markets have seen in a decade.</br></br>The intervention met with modest initial success, but the markets are sure to test the dollar again. And this will increase pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to further increase interest rates to shore up the currency. The dollar traded late yesterday at 1.6535 marks, up from 1.6368 the day before, and at 101.85 yen, up from 101.00.</br></br>In a clear and deliberate departure from past rhetoric, which described intervention as a response to "disorderly" markets and "volatility," Mr. Bentsen said yesterday's moves "reflect our view that recent movements in exchange markets have gone beyond what is justified by economic fundamentals." Trying to dispel the notion that the U.S. wants to depreciate its currency to make its exports more attractive and to put pressure on Japan to agree to trade concessions, Mr. Bentsen said: "This administration sees no advantage in an undervalued currency."</br></br>Administration officials say that the markets have badly misread their dollar policy. The intervention is an effort to "counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar," a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar. That view gained credence earlier this year when the Treasury failed to act to brake the dollar when it fell sharply against the yen.
In a region that lost most of its hometown banks during a devastating recession six years ago, Crestar Bankï¿½Ûªs William C.

Although Harris recently had shifted his focus toward Baltimore, as Crestar increased its presence in Maryland, he remained vitally engaged with the District.</br></br>I larris had argued before many audiences that even with the suburbs' burgeoning wealth, the Washington area could not completely succeed if its core city fell further and further behind.</br></br>"One of the things he absolutely understood was that the whole region had to act together.

Nobody in Japan thinks of the country as No. 1. I think that's merely a myth created by U.S. journalism. As an economist from Japan working in Washington, D.C., I think the readers need some perspective from the other side of the Pacific.</br></br>Contrary to the Sept. 2 editorial "The Japan as No. 1 Myth," most workers in Japanese industries feel that Japan's export-oriented policy in the past has helped in raising their standard of living by securing enough job opportunities. Visit any plant of Toyota Motor Corp., and you will find in the parking lots better-equipped Toyota cars than those sold in the U.S., owned by even the youngest workers. And drive around Toyota City; the roads around are quite good, thanks in part to the contribution of local taxes that Toyota paid to surrounding municipalities.</br></br>It is correct, however, to mention that high prices of land and food products are causing a lot of problems in Japan. Many regulations, tariffs, and subsidies hurt cheaper food imports. But the question is, why is there not sufficient political leverage, or consumer willingness, to change the legal and policy environment related to this problem? One of the reasons is that the consumer movement is not well organized enough in Japan to give it a sufficient say in the political arena. On the other hand, farmers and small-scale distributors with vested interests are much more well organized and have substantial influence in the policy setting of the government.</br></br>In addition, most consumers living in cities have close relatives in farming regions. In 1950s and '60s, many people migrated from farming area to cities searching for jobs. So subsidies to the farming sector are a disguised form of social-security payments to the older population living in the farm regions that draw implicit approval from city dwellers.</br></br>The problem with distribution is related to the unemployment problem. Japan's distribution sector, in addition to the agricultural sector, is a reservoir of disguised unemployed people. There are people who cannot fit well in other, more efficient sectors, who have no other choice but hanging around mom-and-pop grocery stores. It is technically possible to create a straightlined, efficient distribution channel using nationwide chains of supermarkets such as those in the U.S. in just a short period of time, and consumers in Japan would definitely like it. But everyone in Japan knows that unemployment caused by creation of such a distribution sector would be substantial. And the rest of the Japanese population would have no other choice but to support those pushed out of the distribution channel. Paying higher prices for food and other basic commodities reluctantly, consumers in Japan are in fact supporting these disguised unemployed in the backward sector of the economy.
Texans, reveling in their seeming control over the nation's economic destiny, sported sneering bumper stickers: "Drive 70, Freeze a Yankee," and "Let the Bastards Freeze in the Dark."</br></br>Meanwhile up north, as factories closed and workers were laid off, thousands of families uprooted themselves and headed south and west. So many Michiganders moved south that they became known contemptuously as "black tag people," after their car license plates that were, for a time, black with white lettering.</br></br>People and jobs poured into California so rapidly during the '80s that some suburban communities saw their populations double annually, and officials' main concerns were how to find enough water, roads and schools to accommodate the boom.</br></br>As the charts at the right show, those much-publicized migration trends of the '70s and '80s have ended, and more people are now moving from Texas and California to places like Ohio than the other way around. As oil prices went into the tank, taking Texas's economy with them, and much of the news from California dealt with layoffs, natural disasters and social problems, the unglamorous old Midwest seems to be looking better and better.</br></br>"It's interesting to see how quickly {migration} responds to ... job signals," said Patricia Gober, the Arizona State University geographer who compiled the data. "It's not like it takes people two or three years to respond to the boom and bust in oil," defense cutbacks and the like, she said.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and Quotron Systems Inc. said yesterday that have have agreed in principle to develop and sell a computer-based financial information system that the companies said will give stockbrokers and security analysts a boost in productivity and a leap toward a "paperless" office.</br></br>The companies said the first customer for their system will be Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., a division of American Express.</br></br>With the system, a broker or analyst can simultaneously view current market prices, hold a telephone conversation with a customer, retrieve a computer display of the customerï¿½Ûªs portfolio, enter notes about the telephone conversation and enter customer orders to buy or sell, the companies said.

TORONTO--The Canadian dollar surged Thursday, making its biggest one-day gain in nearly a month, as traders took profits ahead of a domestic labor report on Friday.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$1.0319 Thursday, from C$1.0424 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG. The greenback moved as low as C$1.0304 during intraday trading, the lowest level in more than a week.</br></br>The Canadian dollar was on solid footing early on Thursday after strong Chinese trade figures for July. Chinese exports were up 5.1% on the year, while imports rose 11%, a sign that suggests both global and domestic Chinese demand may be picking up.</br></br>Commodity currencies, including the Australian and Canadian dollars, reacted strongly to the Chinese data, which "was surprising given the progressively more sour views on Chinese growth lately," said Greg Moore, currency strategist at TD Securities in Toronto.</br></br>Mr. Moore said the current focus on foreign exchange markets remains on the U.S. dollar, and any other piece of information that could signal what the Federal Reserve's next move will be.
For investors who have champagne taste in stocks, but only a beer budget, what's wrong with buying beer stocks?</br></br>Nothing at all, say the experts. The stock market has marked down the price of most beer stocks this year from their former heady levels, making them affordable buys.</br></br>Two Virginia investment firms recently have issued research reports suggesting that their clients sample some of the new microbrewery stocks.</br></br>Ryan, Lee & Co. in McLean recommends Frederick Brewing Co. in Frederick, Md., the maker of Blue Ridge Beer.</br></br>Wheat First Butcher Singer Inc. in Richmond studied four other microbreweries and expects three of them to outperform the market: the Boston Beer Co., best known for its Samuel Adams brand; Redhook Ale Brewery Inc. of Seattle, maker of Redhook Ale; and Pete's Brewing Co. of Palo Alto, Calif., home of Pete's Wicked Ale.
Stock Market Runs With Aging Bulls</br></br>What might be the sequel to the surprise summer hit: The Incredible Rising Stock Market?</br></br>At 1005.65, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is nearly 50% above its March low. The potency of the surge caught just about everyone off-guard. Yet the rally shouldn't be that surprising, as stock markets nearly always rebound when investors see an end to a recession. The big question is what happens after that initial surge.</br></br>Excluding the current downturn, there have been seven recessions since 1960. In the 12 months from the midpoints of those contractions, the S&P 500 rose a solid 17% on average. But in the following 12-month period, gains were harder to come by, with the S&P 500 adding only an extra 4% on average.</br></br>What does this history tell us? If the recession ended in June -- and most economists predict gross domestic product will grow in the third quarter -- the midpoint of this downturn would be September last year. In the 10 months since then, the S&P 500 is actually down by around 14%. So it wouldn't be surprising if the market rallied further from here. And with the Federal Reserve still intervening heavily to hold down borrowing costs and the government spending money hand over fist, few want to bet against this bull run.
As the House and Senate move to finalize regulatory-overhaul legislation, the Federal Reserve has emerged as likely to retain most of the power and independence Fed officials have feared they might lose.</br></br>On Thursday, senators on a panel meant to reconcile competing versions of the bill voted 10-2 to kill a provision that would have made the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York a White House appointment. The position is now an internal Fed appointee. Fed officials said the change would have politicized the institution.</br></br>Lawmakers' efforts to remake the Fed comes amid popular angst directed toward the central bank for its failure to head off the financial crisis and for the dramatic corporate rescues it engineered.</br></br>A rethink of the Fed has been part of the broader financial overhaul legislation expected to be completed in Congress this month. The House-Senate conference also has resisted a House attempt -- popular in Congress but adamantly opposed by the Fed -- to subject the Fed's interest-rate decisions to regular audits by the Government Accountability Office, which Congress oversees.</br></br>In a tentative compromise, the GAO would gain authority to scrutinize the Fed's 2008 crisis decisions and the Fed would disclose, with a two-year lag, details of loans it makes to banks through its discount window. The Fed now does not disclose discount window loans.
Despite their sponsors' best motives, moves to restart the collapsed Doha round of world trade talks at the World Economic Forum in the Davos Swiss resort this week may prove quixotic. In both the U.S. and the EU, which are critical to any advance, trade negotiators face resistance from powerful farm lobbies.</br></br>Started in 2001, the Doha round is meant to help poor countries gain access to the developed world's markets by cutting subsidies and tariffs in rich markets -- especially in agriculture. In return, wealthy nations would win access to key markets for services such as banking and insurance. Talks collapsed in July after the EU and U.S. turned down requests by emerging economies such as Brazil and India to trim generous farm handouts.</br></br>Trade representatives from 30 leading economies, including the European Union, the U.S., China, India and Brazil, will hold one-on- one talks before meeting as a group Saturday and hope to tell the World Trade Organization they are prepared to resume "serious" formal negotiations. But with little real change since the breakdown, the U.S. and EU remain unwilling to cut farm subsidies enough to satisfy the emerging economies, and the ministers are said to be trying to save face, to show they're working hard for a deal.</br></br>---</br></br>Read John W.

NEW YORK -- A sharp and unexpected drop in U.S. durable-goods orders knocked the dollar lower against every currency but the yen.</br></br>U.S. orders for big-ticket items fell 1.6% in June, compared with the 0.5% rise many economists expected. May's durable-goods orders were revised to show a 2% gain instead of the 3.4% originally reported.</br></br>The news hit the market hard, with traders unleashing a flood of sell orders that pushed the dollar to intraday lows at 1.7300 marks and 136.60 yen.</br></br>The yen suffered its own losses as the Japanese central bank allowed domestic short-term interest rates to slide.</br></br>In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7385 marks, down 1.1% from 1.7575 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. unit was also changing hands at 137.55 yen, up from 137.24 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.6920, up from $1.6812.
A chorus of inflation-related worries pushed down stocks, bonds and the dollar, knocking back the Dow Jones Industrial Average from Monday's record.</br></br>Traders said the declines didn't focus on one particular area. The industrial average lost 45.09, or 0.49%, to close at 9147.57, nearly canceling out all of Monday's 45.59-point gain. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 13.95 to 1864.91 and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.57 to 1115.50.</br></br>The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32, or $7.18 per $1,000 bond, to push up its yield to 5.98%, again approaching the closely watched 6% level.</br></br>Traders blamed the broad-based declines on worries that the Federal Reserve might be preparing to raise interest rates at its next monetary-policy meeting May 19. Volume was relatively light as many investors chose to stay out of the market.</br></br>Inflation worries focused first on April's employment numbers, due to be announced Friday. If those indicate strong gains, some people fear, it could push the Fed to act. Then word spread that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan was scheduled to meet President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin yesterday afternoon. The White House said the meeting was on the economy, not interest rates, but speculation spread that they might be laying the groundwork for a rate boost.
Following are excerpts of the text and remarks at the White House ceremony at which King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed a declaration ending 46 years of a state of war between their nations.</br></br>Jordan and Israel aim at the achievement of just, lasting and comprehensive peace between Israel and its neighbors and at the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace between both countries.</br></br>... The two countries recognize their right and obligation to live in peace with each other as well as with all states within secure and recognized boundaries. The two states affirmed their respect for and acknowledgment of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area.</br></br>... The long conflict between the two states is now coming to an end. In this spirit, the state of belligerency between Jordan and Israel has been terminated.</br></br>... His Majesty King Hussein and Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took note of the progress made in the bilateral negotiations within the Jordan-Israel track last week on the steps decided to implement the sub-agendas on borders, territorial matters, security, water, energy, environment and the Jordan Rift Valley.
WASHINGTON -- Moving to bolster confidence even before the stock market opened, the Federal Reserve cut its target for short-term interest rates by one-half percentage point and promised to continue to supply "unusually large volumes of liquidity to the financial markets, as needed, until more normal market functioning is restored."</br></br>The Fed's move was followed by the European Central Bank as well as the Canadian and Swiss central banks, but not by the Bank of England. "Following the terrorist attacks on the U.S.," the ECB said, using blunter language than the Fed, "uncertainty about the U.S. and the world economy has increased."</br></br>The Fed left the door open to further rate cuts, emphasizing the weakness that had been seen in employment, production and business spending even before last Tuesday's terror, and the economic risks ahead.</br></br>The size and timing of the central bank's next move depends on the course taken by the economy and financial markets in the coming weeks.</br></br>"Any projections about what the economy and the Fed will do in coming months need to be taken as even more tentative than usual," economists at UBS Warburg said, even as they predicted a one-quarter-point interest-rate cut at the Fed's Oct. 2 meeting and another of the same size in November.
Robert Yaro, a fierce advocate for the New York City region in an era that included a deep disinvestment in public infrastructure, rugged recessions and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, is retiring from his post running the Regional Plan Association.</br></br>He will be succeeded by Thomas Wright, the organization's executive director.</br></br>Mr. Yaro is "kind of like an oracle for the industry. Everybody wanted to hear what he wanted to say on any subject," said Janette Sadik-Khan, a principal at Bloomberg Associates, an international consulting organization, and a former New York City transportation commissioner. She is a former board member of the Regional Plan Association.</br></br>Mr. Yaro, 64 years old, came to the group in 1989 and became president in 2001, when he was thrust into the role of helping lower Manhattan rebuild after the terrorist attacks.</br></br>"All of the big systems were busted," he said of New York City when he started at the association. "It's been rewarding to see this place not only get back on its feet but become the center of the galaxy like it was when I was a kid," said Mr. Yaro, who grew up in Kew Gardens, Queens.
Lately, readers have been asking whether it's time to sell. No wonder they're worried. From Jan. 12 to March 24, a space of just 12 weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 17 percent. For the year, Pfizer Inc. is up 28 percent; Ford Motor Co., 31 percent; Fidelity Select Telecommunications Fund, 29 percent.</br></br>Why not simply take a breather? You're not greedy. With the market this high, it's bound to fall and you can buy back later, right?</br></br>Wrong. There may be reasons occasionally to sell stocks, but the overvaluation of the stock market -- alleged or actual -- is not one of them. I'll get to the right reasons for selling below, but first a tougher question than whether to sell: whether to buy. . . .</br></br>The date was May 28, 1995. The place was this very column. "With the market up 20 percent in the past 12 months and acting giddy at such a high altitude," we asked if this might not be a good time to wait -- rather than purchase more shares of stock. Our suggestion: Buy.</br></br>At the time the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 4369. Since then, with dividends included, it has returned 112 percent.
Jeffrey Kindler, who stepped down as Pfizer Inc.'s chief executive on Sunday, citing burnout, is the rare CEO to say that the job wore him out.</br></br>In fact, occupying the high-powered cocoon known as the corner office is more stressful than ever, thanks to a greater emphasis on globalization, stiffer competition, heightened government regulation and the weak economic recovery, say former CEOs, corporate directors and management experts.</br></br>Compared with four years ago, pressures on CEOs "are substantially different -- especially in certain industries," said Steve Reinemund, who retired in 2006 as PepsiCo Inc. CEO "It's still pretty tough out there," adds Mr. Reinemund, dean of Wake Forest University's business school.</br></br>As a result, many CEOs now look at the corporate throne "as a position with a limited term of office," said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at Yale University's School of Management. "They rarely seek to stay a minute more than a dignified decade."</br></br>To cope, a few CEOs cut short their tenure. The head of a mid-sized mutual insurance company intended to retire in early 2013 after serving since 1999. But during a board succession-planning session three years ago, this chief announced he felt "frankly burned out" and wanted to leave within a year, said Beverly Behan, a New York corporate-governance consultant. "It was the most emotional board meeting I had ever been in," she added.
NEW YORK--The Federal Reserve Bank of New York said it invited nine Wall Street dealers to bid for residential-mortgage bonds with a face value of $2.5 billion as it unwinds a portfolio created during the 2008 bailout of American International Group Inc.</br></br>The New York Fed said the bid process was launched after it received several "strong" inquiries to buy the structured debt known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.</br></br>The two "Triaxx" CDOs on offer were packaged in 2006 with residential-mortgage-backed securities containing jumbo and Alt-A loans, which are larger than those that fit into government programs or had limited documention. Such CDOs were at the heart of the credit crisis, fueling more risky lending and later causing steep losses to investors and banks that had counted on their high credit ratings.</br></br>The proposed sale would be the second from the Maiden Lane III portfolio in less than a month, after eight dealers recently formed unusual alliances to boost their chances of winning an auction for $7.5 billion of commercial-mortgage-backed security CDOs. Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC won the auction and had commitments from investors to purchase the majority of the CMBS from them.</br></br>Similar demand could develop for the residential mortgage assets as many investors, including Two Harbors Investment Corp., have been adding the underlying RMBS in recent months. The CDO structure adds a layer of complexity that limits buyers, but some investors may relish the chances of buying such debt that likely has extra yield over the underlying securities that have already rallied up to 10% this year, analysts said.
For an American baseball fan, watching Tuesday night's All-Star Game was simplicity itself: pop a cold one, plop into the Barcalounger and power up the tube. For Japanese fans, though, watching the big game required sterner stuff.</br></br>Clutching umbrellas and rain slickers on a moist, muggy morning -- the first pitch was thrown at 9:30 a.m., Tokyo time -- fans by the thousands gathered on sidewalks and in public squares all over Japan to watch a fuzzy image of the game on large-screen outdoor TV sets. "I can't really say it's comfortable here," said Hideki Nomura, who was seated on the wet pavement outside Tokyo's Shibuya Station. "But what the heck -- there's no way I would miss this game."</br></br>It was worth the trouble for Nomura and other Japanese fans because the National League's starting pitcher in Arlington, Tex., was the dominant hero of Japan's pop culture right now: Hideo "Tornado" Nomo, the Los Angeles Dodgers rookie forkballer who got his start playing for the Kintetsu Buffaloes in Japan's Pacific League.</br></br>Nomo's flawless performance against American League batters in his two innings brought huge cheers from the sidewalk fans. When he left the game, one Japanese network ended its live broadcast and switched to replays of Nomo's work.</br></br>As the first Japanese player ever to make it big in the U.S. major leagues, Nomo stands out as one of the few items of good news in a year that has brought recession, natural disaster and terrorist crime to this normally safe and prosperous country. It's not surprising, then, that every game Nomo pitches is televised live to a rapt audience here -- even though an American night game tends to start shortly after dawn on this side of the International Date Line.
NAPLES, Italy -- The leaders of the world's seven major economies came to this sprawling town determined to bring some order to the world economy, but instead demonstrated the limits of their power.</br></br>Determined to stabilize currency markets, the leaders ultimately</br></br>steered clear of any moves to bolster the sinking dollar. Seeking to</br></br>strengthen the world economy, they instead shot down a</br></br>trade-liberalization initiative that was pushed by President Clinton.
NEW YORK--The dollar declined against higher-yielding currencies, as bets that interest rates will remain ultralow in the U.S. and Japan for a while prompted investors to snap up growth-sensitive assets.</br></br>The Australian dollar hit a nearly two-month high against the greenback, while the Canadian currency moved closer to parity against the dollar, which dipped as low as 1.0070 Canadian dollars, a 20-month low. The New Zealand dollar jumped as much as 1%, before relinquishing some of the gains.</br></br>"With the U.S. renewing its intention to keep U.S. rates near zero until later in the year at the earliest, combined with Japan's further loosening of policy, investors are a bit more optimistic about the outlook for the global recovery," said Joe Manimbo, a currency strategist at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington.</br></br>The rally in riskier assets comes in the wake of the Federal Open Market Committee's policy meeting Tuesday, when it affirmed its pledge to keep interest rates low for an "extended period." The Bank of Japan also left rates unchanged and added further monetary stimulus as part of its attempt to fight deflation.</br></br>"The dovish status quo from the Fed remains the best recipe for market risk appetites and further equity-market gains," said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York.
MERCK & CO., in a dramatic reflection of the pharmaceutical industry's profit woes, said it will fall short of 2003 earnings targets, and announced plans to lay off 4,400 workers in the face of lower-than-expected sales of some big drugs.</br></br>At the same time, Wyeth reported a third-quarter loss after setting aside $2 billion more to cover already sky-high claims of heart damage from diet drugs that came off the market in 1997.</br></br>The news came amid a flurry of third-quarter earnings reports from six major drug makers that offered a sobering checkup on the pharmaceutical sector's flagging health. Almost every drug company is beset with expiring patents for major products and a shortfall in new blockbusters. Competition from generics and a recent wave of over-the- counter versions of some prescription drugs are intensifying the pain at several companies.</br></br>Pfizer Inc. and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, the world's No. 1 and No. 2 two drug companies, respectively, posted stronger results than their rivals, but they continue to cut costs in the wake of megamergers that may buy them time until a new crop of blockbusters emerges. Eli Lilly & Co said net income rose 4.5%.</br></br>The results cast a pall over the stock market. Merck was down 6.5%, or $3.19, to $45.72 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, helping to drag down the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Pfizer fell 88 cents to $30.62 while Wyeth slipped 5.5%, or $2.50, to $43.30 and Schering-Plough Corp. lost 88 cents to $15.12 and Lilly fell $1.72 to $60.78, all in Big Board trading. Glaxo's American depositary shares fell $1 to $42.92, also on the NYSE.
An item in the National Briefing of the March 9 Business section gave an incorrect figure for the net worth of U.S. households in the fourth quarter of 2006. It is $55.6 trillion. (Published 3/10/2007)</br></br>The net worth of U.S. households -- the difference between total assets and total liabilities -- climbed to a record high of $55.6 billion in the final quarter of last year, boosted mostly by gains in stocks, the Federal Reserve said. For all of 2006, households' net worth rose by 7.4 percent, slower than the 7.9 percent increase in 2005. Household debt grew by 8.6 percent in 2006, down from an 11.7 percent increase in 2005.</br></br>Subprime lender New Century Financial stopped accepting loan applications as it struggles to obtain financing despite market speculation that the company could file for bankruptcy protection.

Author: Kelly Evans</br></br>U.S. consumers are loosening their purse strings just in time for the holiday season. But any joy may prove short-lived.</br></br>Consumer spending lately has been showing some resilience. Tuesday's revised report on gross domestic product showed spending rose at a 2.8% annualized rate in the third quarter, up from the 2.6% pace previously estimated. The fourth quarter is also off to a good start with October retail sales posting their biggest monthly gain in seven months</br></br>On Wednesday, the Commerce Department is expected to say consumer spending overall rose 0.5% in October from the prior month, more than double the September gain. Yet incomes are expected to rise by 0.4%.</br></br>What gives? Savings.
U.S. Treasury debt has been a surprising standout investment so far this year, but further gains may get tougher from here.</br></br>Ten-year Treasury notes returned nearly 2.7% through the end of February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, outstripping returns in the stock and corporate-debt markets.</br></br>Worries about Greek debt and of the U.S. economy pushed investors back into the ultimate safe-haven asset, outweighing anxieties about government deficits and the potential inflationary risks of ultralow Federal Reserve interest rates.</br></br>Still, Treasury returns this year are small in comparison with their moves in 2008 and 2009. And most analysts don't see an easy path to bigger gains, barring another financial crisis.</br></br>"The market is not very emotional at this point," said David Ader, head of government bond strategy at CRT Capital.
At the start of the new year, the United States and its major trading partners remain preoccupied with their own problems. They have shifted international economic cooperation into reverse gear and, as a result, many experts fear, could back themselves into a global recession.</br></br>Look around the world: The American stagnation continues; most experts see - at best - U.S. economic growth barely over 1 percent this year. Germany's Dec. 19 boost in interest rates to the highest levels in 60 years has all but killed the prospect that "Europe 1992" will be, as once hoped, a global "engine" for growth. And the Japanese economic boom is clearly over. "After a period of unprecedented growth, Japan is on the defensive," says Tokyo-based analyst Kenneth S. Courtis.</br></br>The German move to raise interest rates at the exact time the Federal Reserve Board lowered the discount rate here to 3.5 percent, lowest since 1964, was dramatic evidence that the vaunted "Group of Seven" economic coordination process is dying on the vine.</br></br>Each major nation is attending to its own current problems with little regard for the impact of its decisions on others. At the peak of the G-7's influence in the late 1980s, efforts were made to coordinate fiscal and monetary policy. But today, there seems to be little enthusiasm among Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and his foreign counterparts for the G-7 process.</br></br>Recently, the G-7 has spent most of its time - through deputies, not principals - on the Soviet food problem. This is important, but it doesn't grapple with macroeconomic disputes among the major powers.
WASHINGTON--House and Senate leaders called for a return to negotiations to resolve the fiscal cliff before the year ends, but they continued to blame each other for the lingering impasse.</br></br>The posturing came a day after House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) saw his "Plan B" alternative to avoid tax increases collapse in the House due to opposition in his own party.</br></br>"Instead of making hard choices or compromising, as President [Barack] Obama has been willing to do, Speaker Boehner retreated to his corner and resorted to political stunts," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said in a Senate floor speech. Mr. Boehner, meanwhile, at a press briefing earlier Friday said while he was ready to continue negotiations it was up to Mr. Obama and the Senate to come up with a plan.</br></br>"Republicans don't want taxes to go up," Mr. Boehner said. "But we only run the House. Democrats continue to run Washington."</br></br>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) likewise pointed to Mr. Obama, also speaking from the Senate floor. "Look, it's the president's job to find a solution that can pass Congress. He's the only one who can do it," Mr. McConnell said.
With the market enjoying one of its best years ever, one might imagine that money managers found it as easy to pick winning stocks as to shoot fish in a barrel.</br></br>On the whole that was true. For the first time in a few years, most money managers' stock portfolios in 1985 matched or surpassed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which rose about 25%. The Nasdaq index of over-the-counter stocks gained about 30%. So it isn't surprising that the professional stock pickers featured early last year in The Wall Street Journal also look pretty good. But some did better than others.</br></br>At the end of 1984, we asked five investment managers to peer into their crystal balls and foretell which stocks and groups would likely be winners in 1985. The prophecies they shared with us don't necessarily represent a comprehensive investment strategy and so they're not reliable guides to the money managers' overall performance. Still, we thought it worth reviewing our report of their stock selections to see which worked out and which didn't.</br></br>Peter Lynch, who runs the Magellan Fund for Fidelity Management & Research in Boston, scored huge gains on six out of eight stocks he named. Like many investors, Mr. Lynch foresaw flat or declining interest rates in 1985, which led him to favor thrifts and some growth stocks. But his selections did much better than average, showing that stock picking is an art even in a bull market.</br></br>Mr. Lynch staked his money on little-known thrifts that had recently converted to stock ownership from operating as depositor-owned institutions. "It wasn't just an interest rate bet," he says. "I thought they would do better because the managers were now owners" of shares in a publicly traded company. "You had capitalism on your side," the money manager says.
Optimism is hardly the order of the day in Washington. But even if you think that a cold-shower dose of reality is what the politicians in tliis town really needed, the situation is more hopeful than most of the commentary here would suggest.</br></br>By dramatically signaling the end of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½morning in Americaï¿½Û euphoria of the middle Reagan years, the stock market may have done the country and the world a huge favor. The reaction on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue suggests that the message has been heeded, perhaps in time to head off the economic collapse that such a crash in equity values has historically signaled.</br></br>Many signs suggest that there is a good deal of strength and resiliency in the economy. The latest figures on the gross national product and consumer prices suggest that we are still enjoying healthy growth without inflation. If the politicians here and abroad can take the well-recognized steps necessary to adjust their fiscal, monetary and trade policies, the prospect is far from bleak.</br></br>For the United States, the overdue imperative is disciplining the federal budget deficit. And that requires that Congress and the president abandon the myth that they can sit on their prerogatives and force someone else to make the hard decisions.</br></br>President Reagan has climbed off his high horse about taxes and agreed that revenues can and must be part of the bargaining. For their part, the majority Democrats and minority Republicans on Capitol Hill have tacitly conceded that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½automatic sequesterï¿½Û is a poor substitute for the tough political choices that must be made to get control of federal spending.
SIDNEY, Ohio -- Monarch Machine Tool Co. has about 340 employees at its main lathe plant here. That is fewer than half the 900 who worked here in 1981 and less than a third of the 1,200 that the plant employs when operating two work shifts.</br></br>"We're getting an order here and an order there," says Kermit T. Kuck, chairman and chief executive officer. "But the market is extremely competitive," and discounts of 30% to 40% are common.</br></br>In Minster, about 20 miles to the northwest, Minster Machine Co.'s exports are down to 2% of sales from about 20% in the mid-1970s, says Harold J. Winch, chairman and president of the closely held producer of metal-forming presses. Meanwhile, imported presses from Japan, Brazil and Europe are obtaining more of the U.S. market. Minster's employment of 680 is down 30% from 1981 pre-recession levels, Mr. Winch says, and unless orders improve quickly, "we will be cutting back next year."</br></br>Monarch, founded 75 years ago, and Minster, which began as a blacksmith shop in 1897, both are respected names in factory machinery. The tough going they're encountering after nearly three years of a U.S. economic recovery illustrates the predicament of many producers of factory machinery, construction equipment and other traditional capital goods.</br></br>Many makers of capital goods haven't fully recovered from a recession that extended from 1979 through 1983 for some equipment producers. They are faced with both lower U.S. capital investment than they had anticipated and increased foreign competition. Their outlook appears to be darkening instead of improving.
More than 2,000 participants at an inflation teacli-in at tlie Washington Hilton here call for a nationwide consumer strike and massive union write-in protest.</br></br>By Larry Kramer Washinetou Post Staff Writer Consumer advocate Ralph Nader yesterday called for a one-day nationwide consumer strike to protest what he called the failure of the Carter administration and the nationï¿½Ûªs business interests to bring down inflation.</br></br>Naderï¿½Ûªs speech came after United Auto Workerï¿½Ûªs President Douglas Fraser said he will shortly ask his 1.5 million members to take time out on the job one day to write Congress and</br></br>Both men spoke at an all-day session reminiscent of the anti-war teach-ins of the 1960s but with political rhetoric closer to the depression days of the 1930s.</br></br>Gari Alperovltz, an economist for the conference sponsor Consumers Opposed to Inflation in the Necessities (COIN), opened the teach-in with a summary of the particularly severe impact of inflation on the basic necessities.
Prof. Allen H. Meltzer's article "Japan Proved Fixed Rates Not Needed for Stable Growth" (editorial page, Aug. 20) was very impressive and persuasive. Although I agree with most of his conclusions, I would like to make a few comments.</br></br>Prof. Meltzer writes, "Unexpected changes in output are a generally accepted measure of uncertainty and costly economic variability." But often a "change in output" is simply the standard deviation of real GNP. Realistically, the rate of inflation, trade or current balance of payments, interest rates and effective exchange rate should be included in any economic indicator that measures uncertainty and variability.</br></br>Second, in his interpretation of the actual function of floating exchange rates, Prof. Meltzer writes, "Until the September 1985 agreement at the Plaza Hotel, evidence suggests that generally the dollar-yen exchange rate fluctuated freely." However, if the steady appreciation of the U.S. dollar under the so-called minimum intervention policy since early 1981 can be considered "free," then the sharp appreciation of the yen since September 1985 has also been a "free" fluctuation.</br></br>Third, I fully agree with his conclusion that "fluctuating exchange rates only contribute to stability if policies are stabilizing." In this respect, he leaves me with the impression that at the September 1985 meeting the authorities made realistic efforts to attain stability of exchange rates. I feel, however, that the importance of the agreement was neither that such an effort was made, nor that policies of various countries were coordinated, but that independent policies that each country deems best for its own benefit were coordinated.</br></br>In this sense, the current efforts in Japan to increase domestic demand are not simply for the sake of the U.S., but in Japan's own interest.
ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Northwest Airlines said it postponed a $350 million debt offering, citing weakening conditions in the bond market.</br></br>"Recent concerns about the economy have forced up interest rates," said Mickey Foret, the airline's chief financial officer. "With some $2.5 billion in high-yield issues coming to market in the near future, we have decided that this is not the best time to sell bonds." He added the airline would "continue to monitor the market and proceed when conditions are appropriate."</br></br>Monday, the carrier said it had no plans to postpone the offering, which was shaping up as one of the week's most closely watched deals. According to analysts, the company hoped to offer an 11% interest rate on the 10-year bonds, but Wall Street observers began to doubt the airline could sell the debt because potential investors demanded a coupon of 12% or higher.</br></br>Northwest officials "thought they had a window, and it closed," said Glenn D. Engel, an airline analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co. "They were overly aggressive in pricing and the bond market was out of their control."</br></br>Northwest planned to use proceeds to pay down bank debt and upgrade its fleet. The airline must raise $500 million by 1996 as part of a restructuring agreement. This month, it raised about $250 million in an initial public offering. Mr. Foret said the company has about a $1 billion in cash and added, "There is no need for the company to undertake this transaction now."
Barclays Global Investors, one of the world's largest money managers, has been selected for the fifth time to manage the four primary stock and bond index funds at the Thrift Savings Plan, the 401(k)-type program for more than 3.6 million government employees and retirees, officials announced yesterday.</br></br>The San Francisco company, owned by the British banking giant Barclays PLC, has held the contract for the TSP index funds since Congress opened up the first fund for federal employee retirement savings in 1988. The new contract is for three years and can be extended for up to five years.</br></br>The bidding process to manage a majority of the TSP's $186 billion in assets has been underway for six months. The Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, which oversees the TSP, requested contract proposals for each of the four funds, hoping to encourage competition by allowing firms to bid for the right to manage one, some or all of the funds.</br></br>In a statement, Gary A. Amelio, the board's executive director, said he was "most impressed and gratified by the strong competition for this business by many very qualified vendors."</br></br>Kathy Taylor, managing director at BGI, said: "It was a very competitive and rigorous bidding process. We're privileged to be the manager selected and to be given the opportunity to continue our successful relationship with the TSP."
The modern sports labor negotiation starts with an assumption by players that commissioners are liars who cook the books and hide the money, and an assumption by commissioners that the players are greedy layabouts who want to make $20 million per year to sit out half the season with spasms. Into this Samuel Gompers nightmare comes the WNBA, a profitless but feel-good league for which there is no previous example, and the future of which remains in question.</br></br>The WNBA has a chance to do things differently, to correct the excesses and inflations that plague its brother league -- or it has a chance to disappear entirely. Before yesterday, it was locked in labor strife because the players don't get that they aren't the NBA. Neither does the guy they chose to negotiate for them, NBA labor rep Billy Hunter. With some patience and sound business sense, maybe one day the WNBA players can argue with the league over some real money, but that day hasn't come yet.</br></br>It's a fact, and a lousy one, that WNBA veteran salaries are around $40,000, while their NBA counterparts are making $4 million and up. It's another lousy fact -- but a fact nonetheless -- that the WNBA remains a money loser that is subsidized by the NBA, and owners increasingly begrudge it. This isn't a Title IX issue. Pro sports aren't about gender equity, they're about the marketplace, and the stone cold reality is that the WNBA relies on the fervent support of Commissioner David Stern in backing the league, against the wishes of a good many NBA owners who view it as a drain.</br></br>So what is "fair" compensation for WNBA players when the league only exists because Stern likes it and believes in it?</br></br>This is the core issue that could sink the league in the long term. And it will rear its head again. The deadline drama was just window dressing compared with the central problem that without Stern to continually persuade and lean on NBA owners, the league wouldn't exist.
[An occasional look at commercial real-estate ventures on the Internet]</br></br>A NEW Internet company called American Real Estate Exchange Inc. is making an ambitious promise to real-estate investors.</br></br>"Our goal is to make buying commercial real estate more like investing in the stock market, where all the information you need is reported in one place," through a site on the World Wide Web, says Thomas C. Lewis, senior vice president of the closely held Bethesda, Md., company. American Real Estate Exchange, or Amrex, plans to officially launch its site this summer, although portions are already accessible at http://www.amrex.com.</br></br>How will it work? Enter a zip code or a county and Amrex does "due diligence" on properties in the area. The Web site displays charts of trends in local demographics; property-tax assessment records; information on local construction; a history of recent sales of buildings in the area; a list of environmental risks; and summaries of relevant news stories about the area.</br></br>Most of that information, which Amrex licenses from a variety of other sources, won't be available until the summer. For now, the site consists primarily of an archive of abstracts of previously published real-estate and environmental news, organized by subject and location, as well as a directory of real-estate investment trusts and publicly traded companies heavily involved in real estate.
WASHINGTON -- Brand-name prescription-drug prices are rising much faster than the overall rate of inflation, hitting senior citizens hard before they have access to a federal drug benefit, according to two consumer groups.</br></br>Prices of the 30 drugs most popular among seniors rose more than four times the rate of general inflation from Jan. 2003 to Jan. 2004, said consumer-advocacy group Families USA. Some rose more. Pfizer Inc.'s cholesterol-lowering Lipitor and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s Plavix for blood clots increased more than five times inflation during the period reviewed by the report.</br></br>The biggest increase -- at 13.2 times inflation -- came in the price of chronic asthma treatment Combivent by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. Evista, an osteoporosis drug by Eli Lilly & Co., rose more than 10 times the rate of inflation.</br></br>A separate report commissioned by the retiree-advocate group AARP found the prices drug makers charged wholesalers for 197 medications rose nearly 28% from 2000 to 2003, while inflation was 9.3%. Such increases, if passed on to consumers, translate to an average spending increase of $101 in 2000 and $181 last year, for a person taking three medications, the report said.</br></br>The price data renew the attention on high prescription-drug prices, an issue of huge concern to seniors who must wait until 2006 to get drug coverage from the federal Medicare program.
A so-so first-quarter earnings season hasn't dented investors' enthusiasm for stocks.</br></br>Profit at large U.S. companies modestly exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations, while revenue was weak and many companies ratcheted down growth projections.</br></br>But stock prices have been rising, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 16% for the year and 4.2% since earnings season began April 8 with a mixed report from aluminum company Alcoa Inc.</br></br>The developments have added up to a rise in stock-market valuations. The price/earnings ratio on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index now stands at 14.5, its highest level since 2010.</br></br>Stock-rally skeptics said that spells trouble. They contend soft U.S. economic growth and expanding P/E multiples can't coexist forever. Economists predict U.S. gross domestic product will expand at a slower rate in the second quarter than the first, when it increased at a 2.5% annual rate. Government spending cuts known as the sequester came into effect March 1. The Labor Department said Thursday that initial jobless claims increased by 32,000 to a seasonally adjusted 360,000 in the week ended May 11, the largest one-week gain since November.
In recent months, Americans have heard reports out of Washington and in the media that the economy is looking up -- that recovery from the Great Recession is gathering steam. If only it were true. The longest and worst recession since the end of World War II has been marked by the weakest recovery from any U.S. recession in that same period.</br></br>The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are "jobs." No fewer than 557,000 of these positions were only part-time. The survey also reported that in June full-time jobs declined by 240,000, while part-time jobs soared by 360,000 and have now reached an all-time high of 28,059,000 -- three million more part-time positions than when the recession began at the end of 2007.</br></br>That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.</br></br>The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.</br></br>At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time. In the long misery of this post-recession period, we have an extraordinary situation: Americans by the millions are in part-time work because there are no other employment opportunities as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary and seasonal employees.
In the matter of Occupy Wall Street, the allegedly anticapitalist movement that's been camped out in lower Manhattan for the past few weeks and has inspired copycat protests from Boston to Los Angeles, we have some sympathy. Really? Well, yeah.</br></br>OK, not for the half-naked demonstrators, the ranting anti-Semites, Kanye West or anyone else who has helped make Occupy Wall Street a target for easy ridicule. But to the extent that the mainly young demonstrators have a valid complaint, it's that they are trying to bust their way into an economy where there is one job for every five job-seekers, and where youth unemployment runs north of 18%. That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.</br></br>The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P. Morgan didn't take on excessive mortgage risk and didn't need (although it was forced to take) TARP money. The demonstrators also picketed the home of hedge fund mogul John Paulson, who made much of his recent fortune betting against the housing bubble, not helping to inflate it.</br></br>As for Wall Street itself, on Tuesday New York state Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli issued a report predicting that the financial industry will likely lose 10,000 jobs by the end of next year. That's on top of the 4,100 jobs lost since April, and the 22,000 since the beginning of 2008. Overall New York-area employment in finance and insurance has declined by 8.9% since late 2006. Even Goldman Sachs is planning layoffs.</br></br>So much for the cliche of Wall Street versus Main Street, the greedy 1% versus the hard-done-by 99%. That may be the core conviction of Occupy Wall Street and its fellow-travelers, and it may be a slogan in nearly every Democratic campaign next year, including President Obama's. Whether or not that's smart Democratic politics, the voters will decide.
Europe</br></br>Fiscal discipline will be a cornerstone of Hungary's European Union presidency, the country's Minister of State for EU Affairs said in an interview.

Consumer borrowing surged in July, mainly reflecting heavy credit- card use, which posted its sharpest increase in two years. Consumers' credit outstanding, excluding mortgage debt, advanced at a 7.9 percent annual rate in July to a seasonally adjusted $1.354 trillion, the Federal Reserve said. All told, consumers borrowed $8.8 billion more in July than during the month before, greater than the $6.3 billion gain many analysts' had expected.</br></br>Lorcin Engineering, a California-based manufacturer of inexpensive handguns, shut its doors last month, according to people in the gun industry.

NEW YORK -- The economy's vigorous expansion is threatening to undermine the nation's hard-won gains against inflation, according to a small but growing number of analysts. And that could mean further increases in interest rates.</br></br>In some industries, factories already are operating at close to capacity and price increases are proliferating, these economists said. Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.</br></br>Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year. That would make imported goods more expensive in the U.S., intensifying inflationary pressures. As the inflation rate rises, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of the dollar's buying power, these analysts said.</br></br>The dollar's fate "is the wild card in the outlook for inflation and interest rates," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. "The dollar will fall at least 10%" this year against other major currencies, he contended. There is an even chance that the dollar could plunge 20%, he added.</br></br>Mr. Hale predicted that the inflation rate will rise to between 5% and 6% by autumn. The closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which has hovered at about 9 1/2% in recent months, will rise to the 10% to 11% area by year end, he said. The rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other, strongly influences other interest rates.
Internet wunderkinds aren't the only ones rushing to cash in on the rejuvenated IPO market. Buyout kingpins are lining up, too.</br></br>But rather than launching initial public stock offerings of the latest Web-site fad, the buyout pros are bringing out IPOs in less-trendy companies -- the ones they bought as investments and now want to cash out of. Last week, Henry Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts took public Boyds Collection, a maker of collectible kitsch, in an offering that valued his firm's investment at four times what it paid a year ago.</br></br>Bully for Mr. Kravis. But are the buyouts-turned-IPOs good for today's IPO-hungry investors? There's a mixed record there.</br></br>What's certain is that buyout firms like KKR, which were sidelined from doing IPOs by the market's turmoil late last year, are lining up at the reopened IPO window, suggesting that public-market pricing is rich.</br></br>Texas Pacific Group took public Del Monte Foods last month, six months after shelving the offering because of unfavorable markets. It recently filed to bring public Ducati Motor Holding, a venerable Italian motorcycle maker, on stock exchanges in Milan and New York.
MEXICO CITY -- On a day when fears that a cooling in the U.S. economy could damp Mexico's expansion, figures released by the country's Finance Ministry showed there's plenty of momentum here.</br></br>Mexico's gross domestic product surged at an annual rate of 7.9% in the first quarter, its fastest clip in 21/2 years and well above expectations, as the strong peso and low inflation helped spread the economic recovery to all sectors.</br></br>Mexico's industrial sector expanded by 8.6% from a year earlier, with manufacturing output rising 9.4%. Construction expanded 6.9%, while mining and energy sectors also increased by healthy margins.</br></br>Mexican officials noted that the first-quarter results were skewed by several additional working days in the period.</br></br>Strong fundamentals are the real story behind the surge, analysts said. Even before garnering a coveted investment-grade rating from Moody's Investor Service Inc. in March, the country had met its overseas debt obligations for 2000. Moreover, despite increased government spending this election year, Finance Minister Angel Gurria confirmed Mexico is on track to meet its target of a budget deficit of 1% of gross domestic product for 2000. slightly better than 1999's 1.15% figure.
Computer Learning Centers Inc., the Fairfax-based computer and networking training company, said yesterday that strong enrollment increases boosted earnings more than 50 percent in its latest fiscal year. The news sent the company's stock price up after several days of declines.</br></br>The company reported that earnings rose to $9.6 million (56 cents a share on a diluted basis) in its 1998 fiscal year ended Jan. 31, compared with $5.6 million (37 cents) in fiscal 1997.</br></br>The earnings report, which had been anticipated by market analysts, helped lift CLC's stock price to $21.71 7/8 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, up $1.98-7/16. The gain followed a two-day sell-off by investors and speculators at the beginning of the week that slashed the company's share price by 46 percent.</br></br>Traders began dumping CLC stock Tuesday after the Illinois attorney general announced a lawsuit alleging that CLC misrepresented course offerings and employment prospects to students in its Schaumburg, Ill., school -- one of 25 it operates across the country. The company has denied the allegations.</br></br>Analysts who follow the company said the strong earnings report does not foreshadow a big rebound in the company's stock price because of the lingering concerns raised by the Illinois investigation.
TOKYO -- Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co.'s agreement to purchase an 18% voting stake in PaineWebber Group Inc. marks an effort by the big Japanese insurance company to tap the high end of the financial business.</br></br>The $300 million accord, announced Monday, will give Yasuda access to the "financial high technology" that so many Japanese financial companies are obsessed with these days. "We need their technology," said Kyosaku Sorimachi, managing director of Yasuda. "We need to train our people through PaineWebber, to get their know-how." Mr. Sorimachi said that the accord allows Yasuda to send as many as 150 people through the PaineWebber organization for various kinds of instruction.</br></br>The Yasuda official said that "global asset management" is very high on the list of things PaineWebber can teach. Yasuda is the fifth-largest Japanese life insurer, with $22 billion in assets. About 17% of those assets are invested abroad, in bonds, stocks, real estate and loans to non-Japanese.</br></br>PaineWebber hopes, for its part, that the association with Yasuda will help the U.S. firm's presence in Tokyo. Yasuda is an old-line, well-connected and very large organization. Yasuda could introduce PaineWebber to potential clients, steer business its way and provide insight into the working of the Tokyo markets, especially the Tokyo stock market.</br></br>Yasuda is being somewhat coy about how helpful it will be to PaineWebber beyond supplying the firm with $300 million and putting two of its own people on PaineWebber's board. (Yasuda also agreed to purchase warrants that could eventually be converted to give the Japanese company 25% ownership of the U.S. firm.)
Author: Mark Gongloff</br></br>Just when markets seemed headed back to normal, the "risk on/risk off" trade has come roaring back.</br></br>Across financial markets, trading patterns more commonly seen in 2010 are returning. Stocks and the dollar are consistently moving in opposite directions, as are stocks and Treasury securities.</br></br>It is a trading pattern that was common for much of 2010 as investors swung in and out of markets en masse-buying "risk on" investments like stocks when they felt brave, and "risk off" assets such as Treasurys and the dollar when they wanted safety.</br></br>That pattern broke down earlier this year, in what some had seen as a return to normalcy. But the tensions in the Middle East and nuclear crisis in Japan have seen it return, frustrating investors who are seeking to trade on fundamental factors instead of headlines. The U.S. and coalition military strikes in Libya that began this weekend could become yet another flashpoint for worry.

Ravi Batra's best-selling "The Great Depression of 1990" (Simon & Schuster, 235 pages, $17.95) predicts "the worst economic turmoil in history . . . more cataclysmic than any mankind has yet seen." It gains credibility from a foreword by Lester Thurow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who calls it "novel and brilliant." Mr. Batra has already made the cover of Financial World.</br></br>"I am no astrologer, no psychic," the author assures us, "not a sensationalist or a Jeremiah." But that doesn't exhaust the possibilities. Mr. Batra is proud of his "obsession" with the teachings of Prabhat Ranja Sarkar, described as an expert in many disciplines, "above all, spirituality." The disciple discovered that "here at last was a philosophy of history that in one stroke could unravel the mystery of every social phenomenon." Like Marx, Mr. Batra's guru preaches historical determinism and class conflict, but adds warriors and intellectuals to the usual classes of exploited laborers and greedy acquisitors (capitalists).</br></br>"The acquisitors grow richer and richer at the expense of other classes," the author explains. Fortunately, this "will force a crisis that will ultimately give way to sanity in politics, the economy, and the general state of affairs."</br></br>"Eventually, things become so wretched that angry warriors and intellectuals rise in rebellion and with the help of laborers bring an end to the age of acquisitors. . . . Society will then move into another warrior age."</br></br>What will this new "sanity" look like? "In the warrior age the army, headed by a dictator . . . controls the government as well as society. Political authority is centralized in the form of an absolute government, people are highly disciplined, family ties are morally binding, women are well respected, and so on."
George F. Will dismisses the idea that it is America's "duty" to repair the world's broken nations [op-ed, Aug. 17]. But this strike against a fringe position seems merely a diversionary tactic, his real targets being Tony Blair, George W. Bush and neoconservatives who hope to bring democracy to the Middle East as an antidote to terrorism.</br></br>Such an approach is folly, says Will, because the social experience of Middle Easterners is so different from that of Anglo- Americans whose "attachment to freedom is . . . the product of complex and protracted acculturation by institutions and social mores that have evolved over centuries that prepared the social ground for seeds of democracy." To believe that democracy can be made to grow in the soil of the Middle East is to believe that "either national cultures do not significantly differ, or they do not matter or they are infinitely malleable under the touch of enlightened reformers."</br></br>Although Will strikes a pose of historicity, he ignores most relevant experience. To be sure, it was 561 years from the Magna Carta to the birth of the American republic, the first modern democracy. But over the next 200 years, democracy spread to more than one-third of the world's nations. Then, in the past 30 years, the trend accelerated sharply. Today, according to the authoritative count of Freedom House, 121 of 192 recognized states have freely elected governments.</br></br>Granted, only 89 of these 121 meet all the criteria for what Freedom House calls a "free" country. The other 32 are rated as only "partly free." These fledgling democracies may lack a reliable judicial system or a fully free press or may be plagued by corruption or civil strife. Nonetheless, the rulers are chosen in competitive elections, and there is reason to anticipate that democracy will deepen just as it did in the United States after highly imperfect beginnings.</br></br>Whether one counts electoral democracies or the shorter list of "free" countries, one finds that democracy has spread far from its cultural origins. There are 30 electoral democracies in Latin America and the Caribbean (of which 21 are rated "free"); 24 in Asia and the Pacific (of which 18 are "free"); and 20 in Africa (11 "free").

Political newcomer Wallace Wilkinson scored a stunning upset last night in the Kentucky Democratic gubernatorial primary, destroying the comeback hopes of former governor John Y. Brown Jr.</br></br>Wilkinson, a self-made millionaire, battled to a surprisingly strong victory over the flamboyant former fried chicken king by calling for a state lottery and promising not to raise taxes.</br></br>"They said we couldn't do it," Wilkinson told cheering supporters at Frankfort's Capitol Plaza Hotel, which he owns. "The only defeat tonight was the defeat of the status quo in Kentucky. Tonight is the beginning of a new era, and we're going to have the lottery, too."</br></br>Brown, attempting a comeback after four years out of office, held a 20 percentage point lead in public opinion polls a month ago.</br></br>"The greatest thing in life is to be a winner. I've had that opportunity," Brown said in a concession speech last night. "The next best thing to being a good winner is being a good sport and I plan to do that."
NEW YORK, March 25 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market today took another step along the recovery road, advancing irregularly on moderately active trading. Airlines were strong.	*,</br></br>This small rise, coupled with the fact that more stocks rose than fell, gave a clear verdict of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½higherï¿½Û for the over-all market, but did not tell the story of great strength by the favored issues.</br></br>Aside from airlines, a selection of color televisions, other electronics, photographic stocks, office equipments, drugs and specially-situated issues made big strides.</br></br>But all five of the leading auto stocks took fractional losses.

In a corner of a nondescript, red-brick building here are dozens of boxes emblazoned with Compaq Computer Corp.'s familiar red logo. The boxes contain printed circuit boards and related accessories for Compaq's high-end computer servers. The tops of the boxes show a return shipping location for Compaq at the address here.</br></br>But this is not a Compaq factory. Rather, it is one of 21 high- tech manufacturing plants that form the global manufacturing empire of a Silicon Valley company named Solectron Corp.</br></br>Most people have never heard of Solectron, or of the curious mix of state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and ancient Asian principles by which it operates. The name Solectron does not appear on any product.</br></br>What Solectron makes is nonetheless very familiar: cell phones, inkjet printers, personal computers and medical equipment that bear the names and logos of a virtual who's who of high tech -- International Business Machines Corp., Intel Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc., Nortel Networks Corp. and others that would rather not reveal who is building their products.</br></br>"We are their factory," said Gary Fain, the Solectron manager who oversees the Compaq assembly line. "We've got their name on it, but they never touch it."
An international economist or investor will claim that the international sentiment toward currencies, trade and the economic outlook in the United States, as seen through the eyes of investors in Frankfurt, Tokyo and London, was the principal determinant of interest rates in 1987.</br></br>Our heavy dependence on capital from foreign investors to finance both the federal budget deficit and the current account deficit (of which the trade deficit is the largest component) were the underlying factors.</br></br>The international investor considers opportunity costs in evaluating investment prospects in terms of the premium on U.S. rates over domestic rates. Consequently, faced with larger investment risks in dollar-denominated securities, foreign investors demanded larger-than-usual yields to entice them into owning U.S. bonds.</br></br>In the United States, the main problems were what to do about the dollarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whether to defend it or allow it to move lower in hopes of reversing the trade deficitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and how to attract foreign capital in order to finance the trade and budget deficits.</br></br>Initially, the Treasuryï¿½Ûªs dollar policy was anchored in the Louvre Accord, in which the Group of Seven industrialized nationsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the United States, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½agreed to support the dollar while the United States made efforts to reduce the budget deficit.
Buoyed by high petroleum prices and an increase in production, oil industry colossus Exxon Mobil Corp. yesterday reported that its third-quarter earnings rose to $10.49 billion, putting the company on track to break the record it already holds for annual corporate profits.</br></br>The results marked a 6 percent increase from the third quarter of last year, thanks largely to the average $65.14 a barrel it received for the roughly 2.5 million barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids it produces every day.</br></br>That average was about the same as in the second quarter of this year but still up $7.12 from the third quarter of 2005, when prices spiked after Hurricane Katrina.</br></br>"It was a tremendous quarter," said Jacques Rousseau, oil analyst at Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. The quarterly profit was the second-highest in U.S. corporate history -- after Exxon Mobil's fourth quarter last year. Excluding one-time gains that boosted the fourth-quarter results, the quarter just ended was even more profitable.</br></br>Analysts said, however, that the latest quarter could also mark a peak in the oil giants' profits if crude oil prices begin to ease. Many speculators and members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fear that the three-month slide in oil prices will continue. For now, though, oil prices remain high, closing yesterday at $60.36 a barrel.

NEW YORK -- As Wall Street tries to pick its way out of the rubble of last October's crash, first-quarter results are expected to prove surprisingly good for some major securities firms not heavily tied to the retail trade, Wall Street executives and analysts predict.</br></br>But an unusually strong 1987 first quarter and special charges at some firms will depress year-to-year comparisons.</br></br>Thus few Wall Street professionals were surprised yesterday when Merrill Lynch & Co., which has the industry's largest retail brokerage network, reported a 37% drop in first-quarter earnings, to $68.3 million, or 62 cents a share, largely because of a big drop in retail and institutional commissions. Merrill earned $108.6 million, or $1 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue dropped 5% to $2.4 billion from $2.5 billion.</br></br>As other firms report first-period results in the next few weeks, a pattern is expected to emerge: a booming mergers and acquisitions business, strong arbitrage profits, a big bond market rally in January and February and some serious cost cutting should help many securities firms withstand the continuing slump in stock market volume.</br></br>Merrill Lynch was the first major firm to report first-quarter results. And while earnings were down, portions of its performance confirmed some generally positive trends. Merrill Lynch posted a 20% increase in trading profits for its own account, and the firm's compensation and benefit expenses were down 14% because of previously announced layoffs and other cutbacks. The stock market gave a slight nod of approval to the results.
Author: David Roman</br></br>SINGAPORE--The central banks of South Korea, Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia were suspected of intervening in foreign exchange markets Wednesday to contain gains in their currencies, but analysts say the continued weakness of the U.S. dollar means Asian units should extend their rallies.</br></br>The wave of intervention, which has continued across the region for most of this year, hasn't been strong enough to reverse the strengthening trend in Asian currencies, as many policymakers are allowing their currencies to rise slowly to limit imported inflation.</br></br>That stance was reinforced after China, the top trading partner for key Asian countries, said in June it would let the yuan strengthen against the dollar--meaning that other Asian countries can maintain their export competitiveness against China even if their currencies rise a bit.</br></br>On Wednesday the Thai baht and the Malaysian ringgit hit their highest levels since the 1997 Asian currency crisis, while the Singapore dollar rose to an all-time high.
John Kerry, seizing the chance to define his candidacy before a national television audience with his presidential nomination acceptance speech, took the fight straight to the two areas where President Bush has enjoyed his greatest political strengths: national security and social values.</br></br>Rather than shying away from ground that has sometimes been shaky for Democrats, Mr. Kerry planted his own flag in a forceful and at times combative speech. "Let there be no mistake: I will never hesitate to use force when it is required," the Massachusetts senator told 4,000 cheering delegates on the final night of the Democratic convention in Boston.</br></br>"Any attack will be met with a swift and certain response," he continued, attempting to meet widespread and persistent voter questions about whether a Democrat, even a war veteran, is tough enough to lead the country in fighting terrorism.</br></br>At one point, Mr. Kerry appeared to belittle Mr. Bush's record as commander in chief, especially his justification for the war in Iraq. "Now I know there are those who criticize me for seeing complexities -- and I do -- because some issues just aren't all that simple," he said. "Saying there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq doesn't make it so." It was one of several oblique shots Mr. Kerry took at the president and his advisers, even as he also called directly on President Bush to run a positive campaign.</br></br>Confronting another of his party's vulnerabilities -- a perception that Democrats are out of the cultural mainstream -- Mr. Kerry's 45- minute speech tackled President Bush on social issues. "It's time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families," he said.
The voice on the telephone exuded bewilderment. "I've lived a fortunate life," Donald Sterling was saying. "As a trial lawyer I generated a good income. I got into real estate and, thanks to inflation and this wonderful country we live in, everything I owned went up tenfold. I have a wonderful family, wonderful friends. But this basketball team of mine..."</br></br>Mr. Sterling didn't finish the thought because he didn't have to. Everybody knows about the Los Angeles Clippers, the basketball team he bought in 198l. The Clippers are famous for failure, a club that defies the so-called law of averages by being bad year in and year out.</br></br>Other teams also do that, but not with the Clippers' obduracy. They were bad last year, when their 9-41 won-lost record was the worst in the National Basketball Association's Pacific Division, and second-worst overall. They were bad the year before, at 17-65. They've had exactly one winning season in the 17 in which Mr. Sterling has owned them, and not many more in the years before that, when he didn't.</br></br>They have some good young players this season, but, as everybody knows, it takes more than good young players to win in the NBA, and their record through Wednesday was 10-24, good (or bad) for sixth place in their seven-team division. They've won but one playoff series in their franchise's 30-year history, in 1976, and aren't likely to add to that total this year.</br></br>The Clippers have been good for a couple of things, neither of which professional-sports teams like to claim as distinctions. One is for ticket availability: Even in the new Staples Center, which they and their NBA citymates, the Lakers, occupy jointly, the Clippers are averaging 6,000 empty seats a game, about the same number as they had at their former home at the old Sports Arena (the Lakers generally sell out). The other is as a source of jokes. "Los Angeles has everything," the comedian Arsenio Hall has remarked. "If you like basketball, there's the Lakers. If you don't, there's the Clippers."
Thousands of current and former Ford Motor Co. workers in Kentucky have taken the company and the United Auto Workers to court to recoup millions of dollars in allegedly unpaid unemployment benefits.</br></br>The trial, which began last week in Louisville federal court, comes nearly 10 years after workers sued Ford claiming it neglected to pay them supplemental unemployment funds during layoffs in the early 1980s. Plaintiffs' attorneys say Ford owes the workers $14 million in benefits plus interest -- a total of more than $35 million.</br></br>According to their 1982 complaint, the approximately 2,000 workers were entitled, under a union contract, to 95% of their after-tax weekly pay for a specified period of time during layoffs. The company was obligated to supplement state and federal unemployment benefits so that workers would receive that amount. But in the early 1980s, when workers from a Ford plant in Jefferson County, Ky., tried to collect their supplemental benefits called "SUB" funds, Ford didn't have sufficient funds, the workers allege.</br></br>The workers claimed in their suit, which has been certified as a class action, that the company had mistakenly paid more than $250 million in supplemental unemployment funds to another group of Kentucky workers who were entitled to supplemental funding from a federal benefit called the Trade Readjustment Allowance or TRA. Some of those workers were getting up to 150% of their take-home pay during layoffs.</br></br>Ford's SUB fund was able to recoup about $138 million of the $250 million through paycheck deductions from workers who later returned to their jobs, according to Charles Zimmerman, one of the attorneys for the allegedly underpaid workers.
Tokyo stocks inched up Tuesday in lackluster dealings. London prices rose amid optimism that Britain's coming government budget could contain extensive tax cuts. Frankfurt shares climbed 1% to end near session highs on a new wave of speculation about lower German interest rates.</br></br>World-wide, stock prices fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index was at 126.66, down 0.08, reflecting higher markets in Europe/Africa and Asia/Pacific and lower markets in the Americas.</br></br>Lodging stocks were the top gainers in the Dow Jones World Industry Groups, closing at 116.71, up 1.63, or 1.42%, with Accor of France posting a 9.26% gain in local currency. Semiconductor stocks trailed at 355.65, down 13.16, or 3.57%, with Micron Technology of the U.S. sliding 8.13%.</br></br>In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index, which fell 54.10 points Monday, added 13.05 to 17802.51, after being confined within a range of about 123 points. In trading Wednesday, the Nikkei fell 101.93 points to close the morning session at 17700.58. Tuesday's first-section volume was estimated at 297 million shares, down from 303.2 million shares a day earlier. Losers topped gainers, 516-430. The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all first-section issues, which slipped 3.60 points Monday, edged up 0.02 to 1420.77.</br></br>Dealings were subdued partly by statements by Japan's finance minister that irrecoverable bad debts in the banking system rose to 18 trillion yen ($176.6 billion) as of Sept. 30 from a June estimate of between 10 trillion yen and 15 trillion yen. Meanwhile, Japan's high-technology sector seemed to have lost its ability to push the Tokyo market higher, contrary to the trend on Wall Street. And auto-sector trading was fairly light, even though some Japanese car companies posted favorable earnings and issued improved outlooks.
WASHINGTON--More productive U.S. workers supported faster economic growth in the third quarter, but slower business investment might limit future gains.</br></br>Labor productivity, or output per hours worked, increased at a 1.9% annual rate from July through September, the Labor Department said Thursday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast a gain of 2.4%.</br></br>Second-quarter productivity growth was revised down to a 1.8% pace from a previous reading of 2.3%. Productivity held flat from a year ago because the increase in output was matched by an increase in hours worked.</br></br>"Firms cannot count on productivity gains to meet gradually improving demand," PNC Chief Economist Stuart Hoffman said. Businesses will need to hire to keep up, "and the labor market recovery will continue throughout 2014."</br></br>Productivity improved rapidly in the early part of the recession but gains have eased in recent years. That roughly coincides with business-investment trends. Companies spent more on equipment and technology in 2010 and 2011, investments that helped improve workforce productivity. Such investments began to slow last year and spending on equipment shrank in the third quarter, according to Commerce Department data.
WASHINGTON -- A war begins to end. Billions in federal dollars, once earmarked for the military, suddenly become available for long-overlooked uses.</br></br>That was 20 years ago, when the Vietnam War began to wind down. But because there was little in the way of advance planning, the "peace dividend" was quickly gobbled up by inflation and increased spending by nearly every other agency of government.</br></br>Today, another war -- the Cold War -- is coming to an end. This time, the dividend will be larger, but so will the crowd of claimants wanting pieces of it. The No. 1 sinkhole: the federal deficit.</br></br>President Bush, anticipating many outstretched hands, warned Wednesday that the nation shouldn't expect a windfall of new social spending. "When I hear now `peace dividend,' " he said, some people think "if you cut defense spending by $10 billion, we can take that money and spend it on something else. They all have a wide array of programs. We can't do that. We've got enormous budget problems."</br></br>Private experts agree. "We didn't have the deficit problem we have now after Vietnam," explains William Kaufman, a Brookings Institution analyst and former senior Pentagon budget planner, who is studying ways that the military budget might be cut over the next decade.
To the market's surprise the most recent Federal Open Market Committee statement didn't even hint at the threats implicit in the rise in commodity prices, especially oil, or the dollar's fall. These events have lowered the threat of deflation to virtually zero, but the Fed insists that deflation is still a slightly higher risk than inflation. Is the Fed keeping its head in the sand? Is Alan Greenspan bowing to George Bush and the upcoming election? Even before the Fed meeting, an increasing number of commentators insisted the Fed is too easy. Now such criticism has reached a crescendo.</br></br>On the surface, the censure seems justified. Commodity prices are rapidly increasing; the Commodity Research Bureau index of actively traded commodities is now at a level not seen since the inflation bubble of 1980. Oil stays stubbornly high, near $40 per barrel, and the Journal of Commerce Index of lightly processed commodities, once a favorite Greenspan indicator, has soared to an all-time high. And although the dollar has stabilized, it is down 25% against a basket of currencies since early 2002. Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.</br></br>But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.</br></br>But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.</br></br>With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery.
SANTA CLARITA, Calif. -- Like many service companies, Pacific Bell is looking around for big steps toward increased productivity. And it apparently has found one: a $10 circuit box that eventually may save PacBell $2 million a day.</br></br>Here's how: Statewide, the regional telephone unit of Pacific Telesis Group dispatches about 20,000 trucks a day to fix customers' lines. When it finds that the line is broken inside a customer's home or office, it's up to the customer to fix it. Customers usually shoo the worker away and do the repair themselves.</br></br>But PacBell estimates the cost of sending out a truck at $140 -- and wants to pinpoint trouble without dispatching one.</br></br>In an experiment in this suburb north of Los Angeles, PacBell found that the solution was a circuit box linking two existing technologies. PacBell computers continuously send signals to the device, which bounces them back if the outside line is intact. Whenever a line passes that test, the company knows right away that the problem is on the customer's end. Using that gadget, PacBell has slashed its truck dispatches in Santa Clarita by 30%. Multiplied across the company, the daily savings could exceed $2 million.</br></br>Such productivity-enhancing technological gains are accelerating in many service companies. Much of the huge U.S. service sector seems on the verge of an upheaval similar to that which hit farming and manufacturing, where employment plunged for years while production increased steadily. But while the competitiveness of U.S. companies will improve and the cost of services to Americans as consumers will drop, tough times may lie ahead for Americans as employees. PacBell, for instance, won't need anybody to drive the trucks that aren't sent out. Technological advances are now so rapid that companies can shed far more workers than they need to hire to implement the technology or support expanding sales.
The annual report of the president's Council of Economic Advisers released yesterday begins not with cautious assessment but a sweeping celebratory declaration: "The past year saw the nation's economy turn in its best performance in a generation."</br></br>The report ticked off the now-familiar figures for strong economic growth -- the rapid rise in jobs, the drop in unemployment to a 24-year low and a decline in core inflation to the lowest level since the mid-1960s. "The economy is remarkably free of the symptoms that often presage an economic downturn -- such as an increase in inflation, an accumulation of inventories or evidence of financial imbalance," the council members wrote in the report.</br></br>Only in the administration's forecast for the next three years does the CEA turn cautiously conservative.</br></br>Like many private-sector economists, those at the CEA believe that some special factors, such as the huge run-up in the stock market, helped push inflation-adjusted economic growth to 3.2 percent in 1996 and 3.9 percent last year. As the impact of those forces wanes, so, too, will the nation's growth rate, which is forecast to drop to 2 percent this year and stay there for 1999 and 2000.</br></br>"We have had an utterly exceptional rate of growth," which has reduced unemployment to a level at or below that regarded as full employment by many economists, CEA Chairman Janet L. Yellen told reporters. "Our forecast is sufficient to keep the economy operating in that full-employment range."
For successful financial professionals, the toughest decision sometimes is when to quit.</br></br>The bond-market outlook made the choice easier for Margaret "Didi" Weinblatt, who retired in 2012 after a dozen years as a bond-fund manager at San Antonio-based USAA Investments. Ms. Weinblatt fears that fixed-income investors generally now face a very difficult bear market in bonds as the Federal Reserve eventually pares back its economic stimulus.</br></br>"Your fund might do well relative to other funds, but when the bond market goes down, all funds could go down," she says. "That can be very stressful for a fund manager."</br></br>Ms. Weinblatt, who is 69, worked in funds management for nearly three decades. At USAA, she managed the $4 billion-plus USAA Income fund and the $500 million USAA Government Securities fund. The funds rank, respectively, in the top quarter and top third of their Morningstar Inc. categories for the past decade -- performances that she says resulted from "being careful to not take on too much risk."</br></br>The Income fund's only stumble during her tenure was a negative 5% return in 2008.
Ted Nigh wants his friends to know that life in the nursing home is all right and that they shouldn't hesitate to visit him. He is getting good care and gets along well with the staff.</br></br>Nigh is 20 years old, a 2002 graduate of Falls Church High School. He is also a quadriplegic with cerebral palsy. With no programs available to help Nigh after graduation, his father, a single parent, felt he had little choice but to put his son in a nursing home that accepts Medicaid patients. Sam Nigh, 54, who was recently laid off from his job at an insurance company, said he hopes that some alternative will come through next year.</br></br>"They're doing a good job taking care of me," Ted Nigh said of the 180-bed nursing home in Manassas where he has lived since May. But his stay "is becoming too long," he added. "You just get aggravated. . . . I don't want nursing home life to become a regular habit."</br></br>Like all states, Virginia is required by federal law to provide special education to disabled students such as Nigh. But increasingly, advocates say, the millions of dollars spent on this education are going to waste as budget cuts whittle down the programs that allow special education graduates to transition to jobs and more independent lives. This creates added burdens for parents, who sometimes must sacrifice their own jobs to stay home and care for their disabled children.</br></br>"Recent budget crunches and tax cuts have further stressed a system that is already very inadequate," said Kathy May, lead advocate for The Arc of Northern Virginia, a local affiliate of the national advocacy group The Arc, which promotes the rights of people with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Rumors of a new, lower-priced Macintosh computer drove options traders to Apple Computer on the first day of trading this year.</br></br>Last week, two independent Web sites reported that Apple will introduce a Mac priced below $600 at the MacWorld Conference & Expo to be held in San Francisco next week. One site, Think Secret, predicted that Apple will launch a Mac priced at $499, sans monitor, on Jan. 11.</br></br>Industry observers say the product would be aimed at personal- computer users who want a second computer to use with their iPod, the hand-held digital-music player made by Apple.</br></br>Merrill Lynch analyst Steve Milunovich wrote in a note yesterday that Apple could sell a Mac without a monitor for less than $500 without hurting margins.
Breaking the Glass for Automobile Sales</br></br>Call it the parable of the broken windshield.</br></br>Besides housing and infrastructure, one of the biggest artificial boosts to gross domestic product from superstorm Sandy will come from the auto industry. When November figures are reported this week, the devastation may translate into the best month for light-vehicle sales since the financial crisis. Though the storm only affected the end of October, Edmunds.com notes that 30% of sales typically occur during those days. It estimates some 30,000 sales were deferred, equivalent to 400,000 at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.</br></br>Then there is the effect of destroyed or damaged vehicles. The National Crime Insurance Bureau estimates 230,000 cars were damaged by Sandy, with 83% in New York or New Jersey.</br></br>Estimates for November's seasonally adjusted annual rate of light-vehicle sales are as high as 15.27 million, nearly one million higher than in October. That would have been nothing special before the crisis, when they averaged nearly 17 million, but it now makes the U.S. look like one of the hottest car markets world-wide.
In most of the Washington area, it's gotten cheaper to buy a townhouse, condo or house. However, the increased affordability has complicated government programs to help moderate- and low-income families own homes.</br></br>Each jurisdiction has a different emphasis in affordable housing, including both subsidized rentals and homeownership opportunities. In Montgomery County, for instance, builders are required to sell a few of their new townhouses or condos at cost to families chosen by the county. Those families can't make more than 70 percent of the median income for the region, meaning the limit is about $50,000 for a single person, $72,000 for a family of four.</br></br>The District occasionally provides tax dollars to groups of tenants in decaying rent-controlled buildings who want to buy and renovate them. The vacant units available after the buildings have reopened have to be sold to those making less than 80 percent of regional median income.</br></br>For instance, Las Marias, a condo conversion by low-income tenants in Columbia Heights, opened a little more than a year ago. One of the largest condos in the Northwest Washington building, priced at $363,000, has been on and off the market for a year. Two other subsidized units remain unsold there, too.</br></br>A three-bedroom townhouse in Germantown that cost just over $125,000 sold to a nonprofit group in April when no modest-income families applied to buy it.
NEW YORK, Jan. 9ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In a reversal of Mondayï¿½Ûªs stock market rally, the Dow industrials sank more than 28 points today after a bout of program selling in the final hour undermined what had been a relatively stable session, traders said.</br></br>With institutional money managers continuing to sit on the sidelines, anxious about upcoming earnings reports, the market remains under the sway of short-term professional traders. But among these, sentiment had turned cautious on the widespread recognition that Monday's 22-point Dow rally was largely a creature of index arbitrage.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Other than for the programs, the market gave a good account of itself," said one block trader for a major brokerage house. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But everyone's on pins and needles waiting for the run of fourth-quarter earnings.ï¿½Û 2766.00,	down 28.37, while declines outpaced advances on the Big Board by almost a 2-to-l ratio on moderate volume of 156 million shares, expanding from 140 million on Monday.</br></br>With the dollar up all day against both the yen and the West German mark and the bond market firm at least during the morning, some trad-</br></br>ers said it will be only a matter of time before the Dow mounts a drive to new highs above the 2810.15 record close of the yearï¿½Ûªs first trading day. But strategist Rao Chalasani at Prescott Ball and Turben said; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The dollarï¿½Ûªs strength right here is probably unsustainableï¿½ï¿½ï¿½thereï¿½Ûªs no fundamental reason why the dollar should be above 145 yea.ï¿½Û The dollar was up
Bailout has been a busy word in the last two weeks. But lending so solvent institutions won't go under for lack of short-term liquidity is very different than bailing out insolvent institutions from their bad decisions. In any case, we've made peace with a financial system that lives a little closer to the edge on liquidity than it would if there weren't a Federal Reserve. Whether the alternative would be a more stable world, with as much growth, is uncertain. But there's no doubt that the system has been conditioned to expect a general subsidy to risktaking by way of the Fed's willingness to provide cheap money in an emergency.</br></br>Everybody talks about moral hazard. A wisp of memory came to mind last week. Then-Fannie Mae chief Franklin Raines visited The Journal years ago and entertained himself by mocking editorial writers who assume that establishing that a policy is economically inefficient is enough to establish that it's unwise.</br></br>He yukked it up quite a bit, in fact, noting that voters are perfectly entitled to assert values other than those of the market, namely that homeownership is a social blessing and should be encouraged with subsidies. And so we've done with tax subsidies, lending subsidies and a concerted set of policies by Bill Clinton's HUD to move low-income people out of rental units and into homes they own. His goal, which was achieved, was to lift the homeownership rate from 64.2% to 67.5% of households.</br></br>But a home financed by a mortgage is not just an asset. It's also a liability. We owe thanks to Carolina Katz Reid, then a graduate student at University of Washington, for a 2004 study of what she dubbed the "low income homeownership boom." She considered a simple question -- "whether or not low-income households benefit from owning a home." Her discoveries are bracing:</br></br>Of low-income households from a nationally representative sample who became homeowners between 1977 and 1993, fully 36% returned to renting in two years, and 53% in five years. Suggesting their sojourn among the homeowning was not a happy one, few returned to homeownership in later years.

AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>"I don't buy that it's the beginning of some huge decline. The market is too high -- it's been too high for two years -- but it can stay too high for another two years," frets Michael Murphy, who publishes a short-sellers' newsletter called Overpriced Stock Service in Half Moon Bay, Calif.</br></br>There is a reason that the "shorts," who make money when stocks go down instead of up, aren't doing cartwheels over yesterday's move. They have bet heavily starting in early 1994 that the stock market was overheated and due for a major decline. But while the shorts have made profitable bets on certain individual situations -- there are plenty of overhyped stocks out there, after all -- the broader market hasn't plunged this year as they hoped.</br></br>Yesterday's drop in the Dow Jones industrials merely trimmed the year-to-date gain in the Dow to 13.2% from what had been 15.3% through the previous day. That is still a painfully bullish gain to the shorts. Estimates of the shorts' overall declines for the year range from 2% to 10%.</br></br>In fact, many of the active short-sellers are currently locked in to bearish bets that have gotten worse over the months. Shortselling levels on both the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market are near records, a total of 2.76 billion shares. If the market shrugs off yesterday's drop and continues its rise, the shorts may have to close out the bets by buying stock at ever-higher levels, a phenomenon that at its worst is known as a "short squeeze." It is only then, say some market analysts, that the market will truly be poised for the sustained decline -- perhaps as much as 10% -- that nearly everyone expects.
If the Federal Reserve, as expected, raises short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point tomorrow, many consumers, homeowners and smaller businesses will shortly be paying more when they borrow -- but not much more.</br></br>Banks likely will boost their 7.75 percent prime lending rates by the same quarter-point. Tied to the prime are rates for many home- equity loans, credit-card balances and small-business loans.</br></br>"I think you would see an industrywide increase of a quarter-point by the end of the week," said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at BankBoston. "The Fed would expect that and want to see it as well."</br></br>But even on a $20,000 loan, that would be only an added $50 in interest over the course of a year, some or all of which may be tax- deductible.</br></br>In terms of impact on the booming U.S. economy, however, that $50 would be just the tiniest tip of a very big iceberg.
NEW YORK -- Investors who arrived late at the small-stock party take heart: You can still get in on the merrymaking, if history serves as a guide.</br></br>Even latecomers fared well in three out of the four small-stock rallies since the Great Depression that most closely resemble the current surge in small stocks.</br></br>Like the current rally, those four began as the economy was crawling out of recessions. They gained steam as the economy strengthened. Only one of the four died. But the loser was the most recent rally, which followed the early 1980s recession.</br></br>Small stocks soared a remarkable 46% last year, as measured by the Russell 2000 index. Now many investors wonder whether they can still profit handsomely if they missed the powerful first stage of a small-stock rally.</br></br>It is a question "that I was asked at least 15 times last week," says Jim Collins, small-stock money manager and publisher of OTC Insight of Moraga, Calif. He is advising clients to invest after the powerful Christmas rally cools a bit.
NEW YORK -- As technology stocks showed signs of recovery, with the Nasdaq Composite Index climbing back toward the 4000 level, bets on a pullback have increased.</br></br>The level of short sales not yet closed out, known as short interest, on the Nasdaq Stock Market rose 1% to 2,808,345,712 shares on June 15 from 2,780,161,105 shares in mid-May, according to Nasdaq. The figures include Nasdaq small-capitalization and large-capitalization stocks.</br></br>On the Nasdaq Small-Cap Market, which is made up of the 893 smaller-cap stocks, the number of short sales outstanding fell 16.9%. It rose 1.5% for the 3,842 larger-cap stocks on the Nasdaq National Market. The figures suggest that investors are betting large-cap stocks have a greater chance of declining than small-caps.</br></br>Short interest is often considered an indication of the level of skepticism in the market. Traders who sell securities "short" borrow shares and then sell them, betting they can profit by buying the stock back later at lower prices.</br></br>Short interest reflects the number of shares that haven't been repurchased for return to lenders. Aside from making negative bets, investors may rely on short selling for other purposes, such as a hedging strategy related to corporate mergers and acquisitions, for convertible securities and options, and for tax purposes.
WASHINGTON -- Secretary of State George Shultz was convinced it was the perfect time to hold Israel's feet to the fire.</br></br>President Reagan, flush with a massive reelection victory and knowing he wouldn't be facing the voters again, would be insulated from political pressure. Even some of Israel's staunchest supporters agreed that harsh medicine was needed.</br></br>So Secretary Shultz pushed to withhold emergency economic aid until the Jewish state imposed a credible austerity plan to get its chaotic economy in order. The U.S. wanted quick action on huge budget cuts and other swift steps to curb Israel's runaway inflation. In exchange, the U.S. would inject as much as $1.5 billion in emergency aid to bolster Israel's sinking currency reserves.</br></br>But like other secretaries of state before him, Mr. Shultz is learning that when trying to hold Israel's feet to the fire, most of the heat is felt by the administration.</br></br>Only two months after the Reagan administration's plan was launched, members of Congress began tripping over themselves in a bipartisan rush to tell President Reagan to back off. A half-dozen influential senators warned Secretary Shultz that "continuation of an exercise in economic brinkmanship -- or 'chicken' if you will -- may soon become counterproductive." House members followed with a similar warning, linking Israel's stability to U.S. strategic interests and pointing out that Israel has taken certain austerity steps.

European diplomats say they are confident the European Union will avoid a humiliating split over the future of Kosovo.</br></br>The Serbian province, under United Nations control since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intervened in 1999 to end Serbia's ethnic cleansing of the Albanian majority, wants independence. The U.S. and many European nations endorse that bid. Russia and a handful of EU countries oppose it.</br></br>Since July, negotiators have been working to break that impasse in talks between Serbs and Kosovar Albanians set to end Dec. 10. The sides meet here again today, but diplomats said there is no sign of an agreement. The talks have, however, produced one benefit: Intense lobbying within the EU appears to have persuaded the handful of countries opposed to recognizing Kosovo not to block the 27-nation EU's ability to conduct a joint policy toward Kosovo over the recognition issue.</br></br>A split over Kosovo would risk repeating earlier divisions over the Bosnian War in 1992 and the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 that left the EU unable to conduct an effective common foreign policy, diplomats said. It could also reward Moscow with an effective veto over EU policy in the Balkans, something few EU members want.</br></br>Read Marc Champion's report: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119551393100498476.html
Inflation may be subdued today, but the debate over inflation is anything but tame. Pessimists, such as hedge-fund manager Julian Robertson of Tiger Management, say rampant inflation is a looming threat. "I ask anyone to give me an example of an economy beefed up by huge amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus that did not inflate tremendously when the economy improved," he recently told us.</br></br>Optimists such as David Herro, co-manager of the Oakmark International fund, disagree. "The global economy is soft, and there's excess capacity, so I believe inflation is still preventable," Herro says.</br></br>The debate over gold, considered an excellent inflation hedge by some, is equally lively. Top investors, such as Paulson & Co.'s John Paulson and Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn, placed big bets on gold in 2009. Einhorn explained his rationale at the recent Value Investing Congress: "Gold does well when monetary and fiscal policies are poor and does poorly when they appear sensible. Prospectively, gold should do fine unless our leaders implement much greater fiscal and monetary restraint than appears likely."</br></br>At the same conference, Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management said he avoids gold because it is "a greater-fool investment." In other words, making money on the yellow metal is less a function of a rise in its fundamental value and more a function of finding someone who is willing to pay you more for it. Tiger's Robertson describes his aversion to gold similarly: "It's less a supply-demand situation and more a psychological one -- better a psychiatrist to invest in gold than me."</br></br>Because inflation hasn't afflicted America in some 30 years, it's worth reviewing what rising prices might mean for stock investors. In a 1977 article on the subject in Fortune, Warren Buffett went to great lengths to disabuse shareholders of the notion that they could skate through inflationary times unscathed. He wrote that companies have little ability to improve returns on capital when inflation is high, so investors aren't willing to pay as much for each dollar of corporate earnings. The subpar 5.2 percent annualized return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index from 1973 through the end of 1981, a span during which inflation rates often hit double digits, provides ample support for that argument (adjusted for inflation, stock returns were negative).

Initial talk is that the five-year paper could yield about 1.25 percentage points above U.S. Treasurys and the 10-year tranche could yield about 1.375 percentage points over Treasurys, one investor said.</br></br>Investors have said they expect Russia to raise between $3 billion and $5 bilion.</br></br>Meetings with prospective investors are due to finish in New York Wednesday, with pricing expected thereafter, subject to market conditions.</br></br>The Russian government is returning to the international bond markets to plug holes in its budget, which is expected to have a deficit worth 6.8% of gross domestic product this year.

Vendex will become the world's No. 3 temporary-help concern by buying 60% of BIS from its late founder's family for 490 francs ($92.56) a share. It will offer to buy the rest at the same price on the Paris stock market, where suspended BIS shares last traded at 533 francs.

NEW YORK -- At least six Wall Street banks are preparing bids for more than $7 billion in complex commercial-mortgage securities tied to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's 2008 bailout of American International Group Inc., according to investors briefed by dealers.</br></br>Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays PLC are preparing bids for the debt securities, the investors said.</br></br>The dealers are focused on so-called commercial-real-estate collateralized-debt obligations, which are part of the $47 billion of debt held by the New York Fed portfolio known as Maiden Lane III. The dealers are primarily focused on dismantling the instruments because the underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities are worth more as individual pieces and could likely generate more trading revenue, the investors said.</br></br>The liquidation rests on the elimination of an interest-rate swap with Barclays, the counterparty in the derivative transaction. As the swap was arranged when interest rates were higher, the contract has risen in value and would require a payment of more than $1 billion to Barclays if the CDO was unwound, two of the investors said.</br></br>Spokesmen for Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and the New York Fed declined to comment.

RETAILERS POSTED moderate to sharp gains in their sales for the Christmas season and generally avoided the ruinous markdowns that depleted profits in recent years. But many retailers remain cautious about their industry's outlook in the wake of recent corporate layoffs and continued uncertainty about the economy.</br></br>Many analysts are lowering their ratings on retailing stocks even though consumer confidence is rising and the results of retailers are continuing to meet or exceed expectations.</br></br>---</br></br>Fed policy makers agreed tentatively in November to lower their targets for money-supply growth in 1993 to avoid a pickup in inflation if the economic recovery gains momentum. The Fed hasn't indicated any change in policy since the officials again met behind closed doors last week.</br></br>---
The White House and congressional leaders made no progress Monday toward reaching a deficit-reduction deal that would clear the way for raising the federal borrowing limit in less than three weeks.</br></br>President Barack Obama pressed congressional leaders Monday to forge a $4 trillion, 10-year deal. But after another contentious meeting at the White House, the odds that Democrats and Republicans can bridge their differences over taxes and social programs to reach such a sweeping plan ahead of an Aug. 2 debt-limit deadline appeared to diminish.</br></br>Republican leaders in the negotiations presented Mr. Obama with a list of spending cuts that had won tentative support from members of both parties in talks last month led by Vice President Joe Biden. But Mr. Obama said the proposal fell short of reaching the smaller deficit reduction agreement GOP leaders are advocating -- one closer to $2 trillion over 10 years.</br></br>Mr. Obama urged Republicans, as he did in a morning news conference, to think big. "If not now, when?" he said.</br></br>Democratic officials familiar with the meetings said there was "no movement" toward a deal in the 90-minute session. Democrats continued to demand Republicans include tax increases in a final package, and Republicans continued to resist, according to sources familiar with the discussions. "Today you saw more real disagreement coming out," a Democratic official said.
The number of agricultural banks headed toward failure appears to have peaked, largely because of massive federal farm subsidies and other government help.</br></br>But while the number of imperiled farm banks has declined in recent quarters, economists, bankers and bank regulators say they don't expect any substantial improvement in the agricultural economy soon.</br></br>Indeed, should the government pare its huge support package for farmers and their lenders -- including subsidies, regulator forbearance for troubled banks, and holding farm land off the market -- agriculture could head into another tailspin. "The government programs, in a number of ways, are serving to stablize conditions," said Mark Drabenstott, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.</br></br>Federal subsidies are expected to account this year for nearly three-fourths of farmers' incomes nationwide, which Mr. Drabenstott estimates at about $35 billion.</br></br>That infusion of money is helping many farmers and, thus, lenders hang on. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks likely to fail has been declining since a year ago.
NEW YORK, Sept. 20 UP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market sagged quietly today until the final hour when a modest buying flurry pepped up prices.</br></br>The net result was a lot of improvement all around but a mixed close that had a slightly lower look about it.</br></br>The market started lower with the aircrafts higher. They later turned mixed and then closed higher. Thatï¿½Ûªs the way a lot of major divisions acted.</br></br>Steels performed in an irregular manner, but the final buying rally favored a few steel stocks, especially Youngstown Sheet & Tube, up VA at 99V2, and Wheeling Steel, up 2M> at 59. The steel division as a whole, however, was mixed at the close.</br></br>Distillers Corp, up 1% at 45%, pulled that division ahead. A lot of small gainers boosted the railroads. On the lower level were many of the oils, airlines, chemicals, and utilities.
For the past two years, with the major stock indexes plummeting, investors have searched for places to hide.</br></br>And they found them in the form of small and middle-size stocks. As the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of large stocks was falling more than 15% over the past two years, the S&P's indexes of small stocks and of medium-size stocks were rising more than 15% each.</br></br>Similarly, when stocks rebounded following the terrorist attacks, small stocks rose 28% and middle-size stocks rose 26%, eclipsing the 19% gain put in by large stocks. The Russell 2000 small-stock index finished the full year in the black, up 1%, compared with declines at big-stock indexes such as the S&P 500, which fell 13%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, down 7%.</br></br>But this year, the run has reversed itself, at least for now. Small stocks, which typically get a boost at the start of a new year, have been falling. The Russell 2000 small-stock index, in fact, has been among the year's weaker performers, down 1.9%, compared with a drop of 1.3% for the S&P 500.</br></br>Small-stock fans, who multiplied as the group moved into the lead last year, insist the problem is a temporary, technical one -- essentially a pause after a great finish to 2001. But they also acknowledge that they expect small stocks to cool a bit this year. And some analysts have begun to warn that small stocks, which trailed large stocks for most of the 1990s, may be returning to days when they do no better than big stocks.
NEW YORK CAP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market posted a moderate advance yesterday, continuing its modest technical upswing of late last week despite weakness in the dollar in foreign exchange.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, after drifting around last Fridayï¿½Ûªs close for most of the day, turned upward late in the session to finish with a 4.33-point gain at 816.79.</br></br>New York Stock Exchange volume remained quiet at 22.47 million shares, down from 23.47 million on Friday.</br></br>Weakness in the dollar is presumed to dampen interest in the U.S. stock market among foreign investors, whose buying played a significant role in the strong rally on Wall Street this spring.</br></br>But after it became evident that the dollarï¿½Ûªs problems hadnï¿½Ûªt touched off any particular rush to sell slocks, the
NEW YORK -- Treasury prices ended lower after Federal Reserve policy makers did what many bond investors had anticipated.</br></br>The Fed left its target for the federal-funds, or overnight bank, lending rate, unchanged at 6.50%.</br></br>But its announcement of the decision suggested that the Fed is leaning toward lowering interest rates in the near future. It said that although there remains some potential for inflation, the risks to the economy now "are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future."</br></br>Largely because of optimism about interest rates, Treasurys had managed four consecutive higher closes through Friday, and most issues ended higher again Monday.</br></br>Yesterday, prices trended lower on profit-taking earlier in the day, then recovered some on the news of the Fed decision. But, "the market was basically expecting this, and had something like this priced in," said Drew Matus, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York.
The idea that American manufacturing is on the cusp of a renaissance is everywhere these days -- except in the hard numbers.</br></br>It's true that industrial production has grown twice as fast as the economy as a whole in this recovery, and manufacturers are adding jobs again. But economists see those gains as too small relative to what was lost in previous years to suggest a full-blown revival. Factories fell so hard, the logic goes, some gains are a given.</br></br>"There's simply no statistical evidence of a broader renaissance at this point," says Daniel Meckstroth, chief economist with the Manufacturers Alliance for Productivity and Innovation, an Arlington, Va., group that represents mostly large U.S. producers.</br></br>Mr. Meckstroth says measures that look deeper inside the sector continue to flash warning signs. Take factory closings. For the past 13 years, the rate factories have been closing has been declining. That's good. The trouble is the rate of openings has been falling even faster. Simply put, America's factories are dying faster than they're being born.</br></br>To be sure, many U.S. manufacturers are doing better than they have in some time. That's visible in hiring. Manufacturers have added more than 500,000 jobs since early 2010, and Monday's report from the Institute for Supply Management is expected to show manufacturers continued expanding in March. But those gains pale compared with the deep hole created during the recession and just before it: U.S. factories lost nearly 5.7 million jobs from 2000 to 2010.
Leaving a recent meeting with AT&T's new chief, C. Michael Armstrong, at the company's Basking Ridge, N.J., base of operations, cable magnate John Malone turned to an aide and said, "I've met every AT&T chairman since 1964, and this is the first one that gets it."</br></br>It appears Wall Street is feeling the same vibes.</br></br>Since tapping Mr. Armstrong, the former chief executive of Hughes Electronics, to be its new chairman in October, AT&T has seen its stock price rocket 44%, giving Ma Bell a stock-market value of $105 billion and a more valuable currency for doing deals.</br></br>But what has Mr. Armstrong, a onetime senior executive of International Business Machines who pushed Hughes into the satellite-TV business, done to warrant all the investor enthusiasm? Not much, at least not publicly. AT&T still faces the fight of its life in the coming year in everything from local-phone services to the Internet, which means its current stock runup may be short-lived.</br></br>Some of the most prominent analysts who follow the stock are witholding their endorsements. Jack Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney and Daniel Reingold of Merrill Lynch & Co. have set neutral and hold ratings, respectively. Under Mr. Armstrong, AT&T still faces the same challenges that sat like an elephant on its stock price under his predecessor, Robert E. Allen Jr.
Two new issues of Government securities carrying the lowest interest rates in several years were announced yesterday by Treasury Secretary George -M. Humphrey.</br></br>He said the Treasury will seek on May 4 to raise two billion dollars in new funds by the sale of a 4-year and 9-month bond bearing l7/s percent interest, the lowest for this type of security since October, 1951, when a \Vz percent bond was issued.</br></br>On May 5, the Treasury will offer a one-year lVs percent certificate in exchange for $7,-286,001,150 in maturing issues paying interest at rates from 2 to 2% percent. The new rate is the lowest fixed for a one-year certificate since September, 1949.</br></br>Expect Neutral Effect Government officials said the combination of new issues is expected to have a relatively neutral effect on the money market, pointing to neither a major increase or a major decrease in availability of credit.</br></br>Officials suggested that the effect would be mainly to help provide a basis for the spring seasonal upturn in business credit requirements.
Never mind that the Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 26% in 1987's fourth quarter, or that some broad market averages did even worse. A handful of stocks still showed spritely advances for the quarter.</br></br>Leading all gainers was Citizens Insurance Co. of America Class A, a tiny over-the-counter stock that leapt 100% in the three months ended Dec. 31.</br></br>Right behind it was Northview Corp., a San Diego-based financial and lodging concern that rose 77% in the fourth quarter. Things didn't look so good for Northview a year ago, when its chairman, Ivan Boesky, came under fire for his misdeeds on Wall Street. But Mr. Boesky quit his Northview job, and in the fourth quarter, new management negotiated a takeover of the company by Calmark Financial, simultaneous to a self-tender by Northview of all its stock outstanding.</br></br>Such winners are a bit on the esoteric side, though. Citizens Insurance's yearly revenue amounts to just $7 million, according to Media General's databank. And Northview chose to announce its Calmark transaction the morning of Oct. 19 -- right before the Dow Jones Industrials plunged 508 points that day. Investors might have had other things on their mind.</br></br>So what about the top performing stocks on major exchanges? In a quarter when the dollar kept falling and the U.S. trade deficit kept widening, it made sense that the New York Stock Exchange had to import its No. 1 stock. Leading the pack on the Big Board was Tricentrol PLC, a British oil stock that rose 40% amid takeover overtures from Elf Aquitaine of France.
What's the best way to make sure that a market crash like Oct. 19 doesn't happen again?</br></br>After a little more than two months of deliberations, the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms, also known as the Brady commission, has rolled out its proposals. They range from giving the Federal Reserve a bigger regulatory role to introducing "circuit breakers" that can cool the pace of trading before a panic sets in.</br></br>Some market professionals are already arguing that the recommendations go too far; others, that they don't go far enough.</br></br>Here's a review of the five major recommendations by the presidential task force, in question-and-answer form.</br></br>Q: What is the central goal of the task force's recommendations?
When it comes to personal-income levels in Texas, the gap between the rich cities and the poor cities is continuing to widen.</br></br>Houston, Dallas, Austin and San Antonio registered the biggest gains in per capita income, while the border towns slowed sluggish increases. Per capita income growth is a key economic indicator. When incomes rise briskly, people have more money to spend on everything from restaurant food to housing.</br></br>In Houston, personal income soared 5.8% in the first quarter over a year earlier as the city's economy rebounded from the low oil prices of 1999. Dallas, which wasn't particularly affected by low oil prices, still saw a strong 5.2% rise during the same period. And in Austin, the hottest economy of all in Texas, incomes gained 4.6% over a year earlier. San Antonio, long a bastion of stable growth, posted a 4% improvement.</br></br>"The strength in the state remains in those large cities," says economist Toni Horst of Economy.com (formerly RFA Dismal Sciences Inc., West Chester, Pa.), which compiles the data. "That's where the growth is taking place. And that's where you're going to see the income growth."</br></br>The bigger border cities didn't fare nearly as well. Even though most of them are growing rapidly, they aren't adding high-paying jobs like the big four Texas cities.
Business productivity in the second quarter deteriorated at a rate unequalled since 1981, the government reported yesterday, prompting some analysts to predict major troubles ahead for the economy's competitive vigor.</br></br>The efficiency of nonfarm businesses in producing goods and services declined 1.7 percent in April through June, its first decrease since 1986 and the biggest decline since 1981, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said.</br></br>Productivity had risen at an annual rate of 3.4 percent in the first three months of 1988, and had been improving at a rate of 1 percent to 2 percent annually in the previous three years.</br></br>Reflecting the strong economic expansion, output of goods and services by those businesses responsible for three-fourths of U.S. economic activity rose 4.7 percent in the second quarter.</br></br>But to achieve that growth, companies increased work hours by 6.5 percent, hiring hundreds of thousands of people to send the unemployment rate to a 14-year low of 5.3 percent.
The 6% drop in German conglomerate Siemens AG's share price Wednesday, as well as the disclosure of more suspicious transactions found in a continuing bribery probe, underscored the challenges that new Chief Executive Peter Loscher faces as he tries to turn around and streamline the company as it launched a major round of restructuring involving deals valued at more than $22 billion.</br></br>As Mike Esterl and David Crawford report, the terms of one deal and heavy losses in a telecommunications joint venture prompted doubts by investors. It says it will sell its VDO auto-parts unit to German rival Continental AG for $15.75 billion and acquire Dade Behring Inc., a U.S. clinical-diagnostics company, for about $7 billion. The deals are part of Siemens's effort to sharpen the focus of its businesses.</br></br>But Siemens also disclosed a heavy loss in its telecommunications- equipment joint venture with Nokia Corp., as well as a sharp rise in the number of suspicious transactions it has uncovered as part of the companywide probe into alleged bribery. A weaker-than-expected quarterly earnings report and investor concerns that Siemens paid too high a price for Dade slammed the brakes on a months-long rally in the company's share price.</br></br>Read our report by Mike Esterl in Frankfurt and David Crawford in Berlin: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118536749155177499.html</br></br>Read Breakingviews' analysis: http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118540259102878128.html
One of the great moments from the Starr Report is when Monica Lewinsky earnestly offers the American President her thoughts on education. But that was mere prelude to the federal budget President Clinton unveiled yesterday. Monica may yet be remembered as the face that launched a thousand new federal programs.</br></br>Congress should call it the Lewinsky budget. The President's proposals for fiscal year 2000 represent a grab-bag bonanza that can only be explained as an attempt to repay the liberal Democrats in Congress who've stood by Mr. Clinton through scandal and impeachment.</br></br>And what a reward it is: $1.833 trillion in revenue, which adds up to the greatest Beltway tax windfall in American peacetime history -- and all of it to be divvied up and passed around by politicians! The only losers are taxpayers, who under Mr. Clinton's proposal will have to ante up 20.7% of the whole economy to the feds. The era of big government is not over; the President has been born again as a tax-and-spend liberal.</br></br>Just for reference: Only once this century has the U.S. government sucked up this much tax money, in 1944, when it took in 20.9% of the economy to fight Hitler and Tojo. But just one year later, in 1945, the tax take had fallen to 20.4% of GDP. Mr. Clinton now wants federal taxation to claim more of the economy than it did during the height of the Korean War (19% in 1952), Vietnam (19.7% in 1969) and the Cold War (19.7% of 1981). He is presiding, and intentionally so, over the only peacetime era in American history when taxes have gone up.</br></br>It's this fabulous rush of revenues -- and not spending cuts -- that is mainly responsible for federal surpluses as far as the eye can see. From 1997 to 1998 alone, revenues climbed by $143 billion, or 9%, triple the rate of inflation. That followed a jackpot increase of $126.2 billion, or 8.7%, from 1996 to 1997.
LAVALLETTE, N.J.</br></br>Study Finds Barnegat Bay</br></br>In Danger From Pollution</br></br>A marine scientist said Barnegat Bay -- one of New Jersey's most used recreational waterways and the source of $3 billion in annual tourist dollars -- is in danger of dying from unchecked pollution.</br></br>Michael Kennish of the Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences at Rutgers told lawmakers Monday that the pollution sources include broken stormwater basins and too much fertilizer flowing into the bay. The pollution decreases oxygen levels in the water and causes algae blooms.
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine oversaw the conclusion of his final General Assembly session last night, virtually assuring he will leave office without fulfilling his most conspicuous campaign promise: to resolve Virginia's transportation mess.</br></br>Facing the worst economic crisis in generations and stiff resistance from Republican lawmakers who felt burned by past efforts at compromise, the commonwealth's 70th governor discovered that the ambitious agenda he laid out to voters in 2005 would remain largely beyond his reach.</br></br>As the gavel fell Saturday night on the 2009 legislative session, he acknowledged leaving his efforts to address vexing traffic issues unfinished and his pledge to fund pre-kindergarten programs statewide unresolved. But Kaine, ever upbeat, said he found other ways to deliver for voters, including Saturday's accord on revisions to the state's $77 billion budget and last month's decision to impose a statewide ban on smoking in restaurants and bars.</br></br>"There are things I wanted to do that I will not get done, and then there are things I have gotten done that I would have never imagined in my wildest dreams," Kaine said in an interview. "It's been a weird three years."</br></br>The House and Senate adjourned about 8:45 p.m., signaling to Kaine that they had completed their work. The close of this year's session marks the start of a 10-month transition for Kaine from elected chief executive to full-time chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
Imagine the scene: A prime gas station location comes up for grabs. A representative from Fairfax-based Mobil Corp. squares off against a representative from Exxon Corp., both bidding to buy.</br></br>Now here's the twist: Neither real estate executive works for the oil company he represents. Instead, both are employed by Dallas-based real estate developer Trammell Crow Co.</br></br>In this era of corporate downsizing and cost-cutting, the newest trend is what is called outsourcing, or turning over operations once conducted by in-house employees to private contractors. About one-half of all corporations now use outsourcing for some real estate operations, according to an Ernst & Young survey for the national Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives.</br></br>Among the local firms turning to outsourcing is Mobil, which recently signed up with Trammell Crow, displacing much of its former in-house service center real estate staff. NationsBank Corp. is similarly negotiating with Crystal City-based development firm Charles E. Smith Cos. to handle property management of its hundreds of branch banks and operational locations in the Washington area.</br></br>But as the trend picks up steam, questions are arising about it. Of the firms surveyed by NACORE, many said that outsourcing had sometimes ended up costing them more money and providing bad service. Conflict-of-interest questions are bubbling up as well, when contractors provide a similar service to firms that compete with each other.
NEW YORK -- You now have another way to pay for Junior's Ivy League education.</br></br>A new type of prepaid-tuition plan, known as an Independent 529 Plan, will allow parents to pay for future tuition at private colleges at discounted rates. It is similar to existing state prepaid tuition plans, but, in this case, families don't have to pay penalties if they choose schools outside their states.</br></br>"You're simultaneously purchasing an interest in all of the colleges in the program," said Timothy Lane, vice president of tuition financing at TIAA-CREF, the pension-fund firm that manages the investments for the program.</br></br>A group of nearly 300 universities including Ivy League schools and regional institutions is expected to participate in the Independent 529 Plan. The plan was approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month and is expected to be launched July 1.</br></br>Participants can buy a "piece" of a private college's tuition at current rates that can be redeemed as payment at any one of the schools that participate in the program. The amount of tuition that participants can prepay will depend on the school: the higher the school's tuition, the lower the percentage the money buys.
NEW YORK -- Cyclicals led the stock market higher as investors continued to celebrate the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its third straight advance,</br></br>climbing 15.14, or 0.39%, to 3878.18. The average tumbled nearly 105</br></br>points last week on worries that rates would rise. Central bank policy</br></br>makers left rates unchanged at their meeting Tuesday.
LONDON, Oct. 29ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Faced with intense political pressure today to cut British interest rates. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament that action on the U.S. budget deficit was "the most important single thingï¿½Û needed to restore stability to international financial markets.</br></br>In an acrimonious exchange, opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kin-nock called for "significant cutsï¿½Û in interest rates, beyond the "inconsequentialï¿½Û half percentage point reduction that brought British base rates down to 9.5 percent last week.</br></br>But Thatcher fended off the questions and quickly focused on the "vitalï¿½Û need for "early and decisive actionï¿½Û in Washington.</br></br>"I welcome the talks President Reagan is having with Congress about cutting the U.S. budget deficit,ï¿½Û Thatcher said. She called for measures that, "both in scale and content, go beyond what has previously been envisaged, yet would do more than anything else to bring back confidence.ï¿½Û</br></br>American economists and politicians, including many who have long urged the administration to raise taxes and cut government spending, now are debating whether those measures might actually deepen the current crisis by throwing the economy into a recessionary deep freeze.
The nation's jobless rate jumped to 5.7 percent last month, the highest level in more than six years, as the recession drove employers in most industries to shed workers and cut costs.</br></br>Nearly a half million people joined the ranks of the unemployed in November, bringing the total to 8.2 million, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>The increase from 5.4 percent in October was evidence of the continued sharp deterioration of the job market since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. As the economy slowed over the past year, unemployment had been rising slowly, from a three-decade low of 3.9 percent in October 2000, before shooting up in the past two months, when 1.1 million more people lost their jobs.</br></br>The layoffs continued even as signs mounted that the recession that began last spring may be close to running its course, according to several forecasters, some of whom have begun predicting that the economy may start growing again early next year.</br></br>Even if the recession does end soon, many forecasters expect the unemployment rate to continue rising for several months, reaching 6.5 percent or so next year before it begins to come down. That's because at the end of a slump, as demand picks up, employers can usually boost production without having to hire more workers, which they usually don't want to do until they are sure how strong the recovery will be.
Author: V. Phani Kumar in Hong KongAnd Shri Navaratnam; Puja Rajeev in Singapore</br></br>(Please see Correction .)</br></br>Most Asian markets advanced Thursday, with South Korean equities staging a strong rebound as foreigners turned buyers and snapped up beaten-down stocks, while Chinese banks helped lift Hong Kong shares on an upbeat earnings outlook.</br></br>Japan's Nikkei Stock Average added 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbed 0.3%, South Korea's Kospi jumped 2.2%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 inched up 0.1% and Taiwan's Taiex finished 1.4% higher.</br></br>Regional sentiment was underpinned by Wednesday's modest rise on Wall Street, an increase in U.S. index futures, the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report of an improving U.S. economy and accelerating European manufacturing activity.
While the incomes of most American households have remained stubbornly flat over the past three decades, the elderly have seen their financial circumstances improve dramatically, far outpacing every other demographic group, the Census Bureau reported yesterday.</br></br>An analysis of household income from 1969 to 1996 showed a 57 percent rise in real median income for married couples over age 65, dwarfing the 6.3 percent increase for all households. Among elderly people living alone, incomes went up even more -- 63 percent.</br></br>The improvements can be traced largely to increases in Social Security benefits and pensions, but also reflect a generation that enjoyed the combined effect of the G.I. Bill that gave many more college educations, a booming real estate market and the entry of more women into the labor force.</br></br>These changes, said Martin Corry, director of federal affairs at the American Association of Retired Persons, "have meant light-years of difference for that whole generation."</br></br>In fact, the result has been to create a very different profile of retirement and aging. As late as the 1960s, many elderly ended up in county homes for the aged, a bed of last resort for those without income, family or health care coverage. Now, most older Americans are able to either live at home or, in a small but growing number of cases, move into retirement communities and assisted living facilities that enable them to live more active lives.
Automobile makers raised prices and reduced dealer incentives on 2004 car models in October while California, the nation's biggest auto market, increased car taxes -- moves that prompted consumers to cut back on purchases.</br></br>That was the upshot of a slew of government data released Friday. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that producer prices rose a larger-than-expected 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis in October from the month before, largely because of higher auto prices. Meanwhile, the U.S. Census Bureau reported retail sales slipped 0.3% in October, largely due to declining auto sales.</br></br>"Manufacturers are adjusting incentives in part to see how well their products can do without incentives as the economy strengthens," said Robert Schnorbus, chief economist at J.D. Power & Associates, a market research company. "Consumers, being finicky as they are, just don't like to see incentives go down, and they're pulling back."</br></br>The Federal Reserve also reported that industrial production rose for the fourth straight month in October, but the pace of increases was curtailed by a slowdown in motor vehicle assemblies.</br></br>Some auto makers responded by fattening incentives in November. This is leading some economists to predict the October sales slowdown and the spike in prices will be temporary. "It is the pregnant pause of a wiser consumer," said David Littman, chief economist of Comerica Bank in Detroit. Underscoring expectations of a pickup in consumer spending later in the year, the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment rose to 93.5 in early November, stronger than the late October reading of 89.6.
WITH Chelsea Property Group Inc.'s business driven by two things heavily impacted by the Sept. 11 attacks -- tourism and retail sales -- one might expect the outlet-center owner's stock to plummet and the company to lower its earnings projection.</br></br>But surprisingly, the company has emerged as one of a small number of real-estate investment trusts this year to publicly announce satisfaction with earlier earnings projections. And its total return -- stock price plus dividend paid to shareholders -- has risen 5% since trading resumed after Sept. 11, according to the Morgan Stanley REIT index. REITs overall have risen an average 4% in the same period.</br></br>To be sure, the Roseland, N.J., REIT looks especially vulnerable, as fears of flying keep would-be travelers -- and shoppers -- home and as the economy has sunk into a recession. But investors seem to be focusing more on Chelsea's earnings, which have risen, than on same-space sales, which have fallen. Chelsea reported 9% growth in per-share, third-quarter funds from operations, a commonly used measure of REITs' financial performance, beating analysts' estimates compiled by Thomson Financial/First Call.</br></br>In addition, company officials expect an immediate earnings boost from Chelsea's $180 million acquisition of 31 retail properties from Konover Property Trust Inc., Raleigh, N.C. The deal was completed Sept. 25.</br></br>"It's a good news, bad news thing," says Lee Schalop, analyst at Banc of America Securities in New York, with the good news winning out. "They have some bad news on sales but they bought some assets at incredibly attractive prices, with extremely high returns. Those high returns will flow through their bottom line in 2002."
While Treasury Secretary John B. Connally was telling a Senate subcommittee yesterday the worst thing that could happen to the economy was a rise in interest rates, the top economist for one of the nationï¿½Ûªs largest stock brokerage houses was predicting an increase in both long and shortterm rates.</br></br>Henry Kaufman, of Salomon Brothers, said that by this summer short-term Treasury bill rates should be up to 5% per cent, with longer term corporate securities up to IVz to 8V2 per cent. Weekly Treasury bill rates yesterday jumped</br></br>Bond prices, though, closed at near their lows for the day in very quiet trading. Fixed income securities have been declining for the last seven or eight weeks. Corporate bond prices were marked down about $1 from Friday.</br></br>Meanwhile, the dollar came under renewed pressures in Germany yesterday after reports that West German central bank president Karl Kla-sen had resigned.</br></br>The dollar closed at 3.542 marks to the dollar, roughly unchanged from its opening position. After rumors of Kia- senï¿½Ûªs resignation emerged, it had slipped to 3.536 marks to the dollar. When the Bundesbank denied the rumor later, the dollar moved back up.
A blue-chip rally sparked by an upturn in bond prices enabled the stock market to close higher yesterday for the first time in six sessions. Trading was active.</br></br>The bond market headed up after Paul Volcker, Federal Reserve Board chairman, indicated in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee that the Fed left credit policy essentially unchanged at its July meeting. He also said that the Fed's Open Market Committee expects economic growth to moderate soon.</br></br>After sliding 36.33 points to a 17-month low in the prior five sessions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost another 3.75 points in yesterday's first 90 minutes; rebounding during the afternoon, the index showed a 13.47-point gain at 3 p.m. EDT, and finished at 1096.95, up 10.38 points. The utility indicator also rose, but the transportation average lost ground.</br></br>The broader market wasn't so strong as the industrial average. New York Stock Exchange gainers led losers by 789-to-739.</br></br>"The market was reacting to a better bond market, and particularly to Mr. Volcker's statement that the economic expansion is expected to moderate," asserted Robert Kahan, partner in charge of trading at Montgomery Securities, San Francisco. He also noted that "a major buy program came into the market."
It's hard not to feel some sympathy for departing Treasury Secretary John Snow. He worked tirelessly for President Bush, trudging all over the country to plug the administration's policies. In 2005 Snow spoke at the Detroit Economic Club, the Omaha Chamber of Commerce and the Sony Technology Center in Mount Pleasant, Pa. For all his trouble, Snow earned only perfunctory public gratitude from the president and was subjected to repeated rumors that the White House was unhappy with his performance. Worse, he seemed to have had little effect on policy or the economy.</br></br>The same fate may befall Snow's anointed successor, Henry "Hank" Paulson, head of the highly profitable investment banking firm Goldman Sachs. Of course, it's not supposed to be this way. Paulson comes advertised as a Wall Street take-charge guy who will improve public economic confidence and reassert control over policy.</br></br>But how is that to happen? Unless he blunders badly, Paulson's role as chief economic spokesman doesn't matter much. Most Americans don't know the name of the Treasury secretary and don't care. What they care about is $3-a-gallon gasoline and 6.5 percent mortgage rates.</br></br>It's possible that Paulson will have more influence on policy than Snow had. As economist Roger Kubarych of HVB America points out, there's no shortage of challenges: trying to avert big bankruptcies (GM) in the auto industry; preventing disorderly shifts in global currency rates; curbing federal spending on retirement benefits; fixing the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., which insures defined-benefit pensions. The trouble is that Bush's positions on most issues are already set. Even if they weren't, many powerful interests -- Congress, the United Auto Workers, China, AARP -- may limit what Paulson can actually accomplish.</br></br>To excel as Treasury secretary, Paulson needs something no one wants: an economic crisis that enables him to act as hero, much as then-Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin (also once head of Goldman Sachs) and then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan did during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. Any new upset would spotlight Paulson (assuming the Senate confirms him) along with the new Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke. What are the odds of a crisis? Not great -- but not negligible, either. After three years of strong performance (5.3 million new jobs, 4.6 percent unemployment), the U.S. economy could be at a tipping point. Two problems loom: one traditional, one not.
m The stateï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate dropped to 6 percent in February, while the national rate rose 0.5 percent to 7.8 percent, the Virginia Employment Commission reported yesterday.</br></br>VEC analyst William Mezger predicted a drop to 5.7 percent in March as seasonal employment starts to crank up.</br></br>Some 51,000 were drawing jobless benefits, up from Januaryï¿½Ûªs 50,000 but well below the 55,000 in February.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	Despite a continually diminishing share of the car market, Renault managed to narrow its 1985 losses to about $1.56 billion from about $1.79 billion a year earlier, the company said yesterday.</br></br>Franceï¿½Ûªs state-owned auto group said the improvement largely reflects a dip in one-time restructuring charges to $490 million from $642 million in 1984. But its main automobile activities continued to generate heavy losses last year under the burden of weak new car demand and stiff competition.
A mild stock rally fizzled late today, overwhelmed by computerized selling strategies and anxiety that has afflicted investors since the historic market collapse exactly six months ago.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip stocks, up more than 32 points at midafternoon, slid in the final hours and finished down 8.62 to 1999.50, back under the 2000 level for the first time in two weeks. Most broader market indices also fell.</br></br>"People are willing to venture into the market on a day-by-day basis, but not much longer," said Joseph Barthel, technical analyst at the Butcher & Singer Co. investment firm. "Without some sort of clarification, I think we're doomed to this type of whipsaw action."</br></br>The market strengthened through the early hours, largely because of sharply higher earnings reported by some leading companies that constitute the Dow average. A partial recovery in the slumping bond market also helped by easing interest rates, thereby making bonds a less attractive alternative to stocks.</br></br>But bonds weakened in the afternoon on renewed fears of inflation and fighting in the Persian Gulf. Traders said this helped provide an excuse to bail out of stocks and erase the day's gains.
The United States appears to be approaching the Great Divide in manpower policy: unemployment, as it steadily decreases, is becoming</br></br>The point was underscored yesterday when the Bureau of Labor .Statistics revealed that unemployment fell to 4.3 per cent in October on a seasonally-adjusted basis.</br></br>This is the lowest rate since the big boom of the mid-1960s was drawing to a close. More importantly, it is within striking distance of the interim goal of 4 per cent set by President Kennedyï¿½Ûªs Council of Economic Advisers in 1961.</br></br>Now an agreeably surprised Johnson Administration, which had not expected the rate to fall much below 5 per cent during 1965, must look beyond the interim goal. The signs are that it has already changed its policy mix.</br></br>Presidents Kennedy and Johnson have both fought unemployment on two broad fronts. On the demand side, they sought to create jobs for idle men by increasing purchasing power and investment incentives through fiscal and monetary policy. On the supply side, they sought to adapt idle men to job opportunities through ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½structural" programs such as the Man-Power Development and Training Act.
Philip ;Booth; 74, a retired Labor Department official and ï¿½Ûªformer Washington resident who was an authority, on Social Security and unemployment compensation laws* died Sunday at his home in San Diego, Calif., after a heart attack.</br></br>Mr; Booth came to Washington in 1936 and i joined the Federal Security Administration, where ! he worked on projects dealing with Social Secu-1 rity. He joined the Labor Department during the i 1940s. During World War II, he worked on the settlement of Jewish refugees in this country.</br></br>During the late 1950s, Mr. Booth served with the International Labor Organization in Geneva. He was chief of state programs for compliance and legislation in Laborï¿½Ûªs unemployment division for three years before retiring in 1962.</br></br>Between 1962 and 1973, he taught at the University of Michiganï¿½Ûªs school of social work and wrote ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Social Security in America.ï¿½Û Since moving to San Diego in 1973, he had been a consultant to the National Committee on Unemployment Com-, pensation.</br></br>Mr. Booth was born in Minnesota and reared in Chicago. He earned a bachelorï¿½Ûªs degree at the University of Arizona and did graduate work at the University of Chicago. Before coming to Washington, he taught in Chicago and worked with the Chicago Federation of Labor.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Selling in the tobacco group combined with profit warnings and high oil prices to nudge small-capitalization stocks into the minus column with the overall market.</br></br>Investors shunned tobacco stocks ahead of the government's opening arguments in its $280 billion civil racketeering lawsuit against the cigarette industry this week. Vector Group tumbled 89 cents, or 5.6%, to $14.93, and Universal Corp. lost 60 cents, or 1.4%, to 43.97, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>Large-cap Colgate-Palmolive's profit warning sent shares of consumer-products makers tumbling. Fragrance and decor company Blyth slipped 34 cents, or 1.1%, to 31.06, while scented-candle maker Yankee Candle Co. slipped 12 cents, or 0.4%, to 27.88, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>On top of these developments, oil prices closed above $46 a barrel in New York, reigniting concerns about the impact high fuel costs may have on consumer spending. When crude-oil prices rise above $45 a barrel, "you are just taking money out of people's pockets," said Michael O'Hare, head of block trading at Lehman Brothers.
United Parcel Services Inc.'s first-quarter profit jumped 33% as the shipping company reported higher package volume, led by a significant increase abroad.</br></br>UPS, a bellwether of the broader economy, disclosed the better-than-expected preliminary results two weeks ago, and was one of the first to signify a rebound in the freight-transport sector was underway.</br></br>Tuesday, UPS executives said the broad economic recovery appears poised to gain steam, although they described the upturn as more "measured" than dramatic to this point.</br></br>Chief Executive Scott Davis said demand picked up throughout the first quarter, a trend that has continued so far in the second quarter.</br></br>"Economies around the world are showing signs of recovery," Davis said.
Beginning next month in the ancient capital city of Nara, you will be able to buy a cup of coffee for $350.</br></br>Your Evian water will be heated in a gold kettle, poured through Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, dusted with real gold and served in gold-plated Royal Minton china. A genuine Renoir painting will hang on the coffee shop wall. And, as in many other such places in Japan catering to the very rich, you will be able to linger as long as you like.</br></br>"In and around Nara these days, there are many people with money, but they're not so good at spending it," said Nobuhisa Tomishige, spokesman for the department store where the coffee shop is located. "We hope to make their lives more colorful."</br></br>For 45 years, since the end of World War II, Japan doggedly worked to catch up to the United States, eschewing any other ideology and postponing pleasure. Now, many Japanese are taking a crash course in spending money, buying $2 million golf club memberships and $700 steaks, gold-wrapped sushi and mink coats for dogs. Japan, with 123 million people, has triple the net assets, per capita, of the United States, and its per capita income has also surpassed America's.</br></br>But this sudden wealth is creating new conflict and self-doubt within Japanese society, just as Japan is being pressed by the world to define its values and intentions.
Real help for housing will not be forthcoming until soaring prices and interest rates are whipped. Dr. Saul B. Klaman, vice president and chief economist of the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks, said recently in Rochester, N.'ST.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The hard fact is that hope for housing is tied directly to hope for the economy,ï¿½Û the NAMSB economist emphasized to the Rochester Real Estate Board.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In this respect, one can begin to detect some signs of recovery from the many months of economic malaise,ï¿½Û Klaman continued. The past few weeks may in retrospect prove to have been the turning point in the nearly uninterrupted upward sweep of interest rates, he, said, and as evidence that "there is more than wishful thinking in this view.ï¿½Û Klaman cited the following: ï¿½Û¢	Progress, however limited, on the inflation front, with cooling off in the fuel and food sectors; and</br></br>"If evidence of an improved economic climate continues to accumulate, the momentum for favorable change could accelerate,ï¿½Û said Klaman, suggesting the prospect of some decline in short-term interest rates. program to aid housing is at best a temporary stopgap measux*e which can provide only marginal assistance to the nationï¿½Ûªs depressed housing market, Klaman commented.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"Forty per cent of these housing aid dollars consist of proposed Federal Home Loan Bank advances to savings and loans, many of whom may not wish to borrow further, even at below, market interest rates," he pointed out.
Dubai, United Arab Emirates -- In this oil-fueled boomtown, which runs on imported labor, the dollar's sharp tumble is contributing to civil strife.</br></br>In recent days, thousands of expatriate construction workers walked off job sites to protest low pay and the rising cost of living. Law- enforcement officials -- who typically play down the scope of labor actions here -- have acknowledged widespread protests, isolated violence and dozens of arrests.</br></br>Sporadic, small-scale strikes are nothing new in Dubai, where hundreds of thousands of low-paid laborers are building a soaring skyline and live in camps on the outskirts of town. After criticism by human-rights groups, officials launched a high-profile campaign to clean up labor practices.</br></br>But officials are finding it more difficult to deal with what has increasingly become one of the workers' chief complaints: A weak dollar, coupled with rampant inflation, means it is hard to send enough money home to make it worth sticking around.</br></br>Dubai is one of seven emirates that make up the United Arab Emirates. Like most of the oil-rich Persian Gulf, the UAE links its currency to the dollar. With oil production dwindling, Dubai has diversified its economy, trying to remake itself as a regional hub for entertainment, tourism and financial services. It relies on imported workers for almost all of its construction and menial-labor needs.
Quarter's end brought a one-day bounce for stocks and bonds, leaving investors to debate whether they can hope for a more lasting rebound as the year's final quarter begins.</br></br>Amid heavy buying by large professional investors that wanted to avoid showing unspent cash on their books, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.47 points, or 1.21%, to 10336.95, the blue-chip index's biggest gain in almost four weeks.</br></br>With the latest economic news seeming to militate against a Federal Reserve interest-rate increase, investors also turned more optimistic about the market's future. Most major indexes gained, although technology stocks tended to lag behind. Treasury bonds posted sharp gains. The dollar, which has been regaining ground against the yen in recent days, pulled back a bit.</br></br>"It was end of the quarter, so there was a lot of portfolio rebalancing," said John Peluso, head of block trading at Lehman Brothers. Perhaps more significant, he said, was a rebound by bank and financial stocks that appeared to start before the brunt of the rebalancing process hit. "That gave a better tone to the tape and that's what gave legs to the market," Mr. Peluso said.</br></br>Financial stocks benefited from news that second-quarter economic growth was slower than initially believed and that unemployment claims were up last week. This added credence to the widening view that inflation is under control and that the Federal Reserve may leave interest rates alone at its policy meeting on Tuesday.
In the debate about the U.S. international role after the Cold War, some of the country's leading diplomatic specialists are calling for the administration to shift emphasis from foreign to domestic concerns.</br></br>Governors, mayors and other officials who deal daily with America's economic and social problems have long called for such a shift in priorities.</br></br>"What is desperately required is a psychological turn inward," declared William G. Hyland, editor of Foreign Affairs, the nation's best-known foreign policy journal. In a May 20 New York Times article that rattled many diplomatic teacups, Hyland argued that in the absence of a persuasive overseas threat, "we need to start selectively disengaging abroad to save resources," lest the United States be mired in a long-term social and economic crisis that will undermine the basis for a strong U.S. foreign policy.</br></br>"I began musing about the end of the Cold War," explained Hyland in an interview, "and thinking about how pervasive foreign policy has become over the years. We built up all these institutions where I worked - the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Council, State Department. Every president has become captured by this. But it's all over. We may now be trying to perpetuate something from the past, to give urgency to {international} issues that are no longer all that urgent."</br></br>Shortly after Hyland's article appeared, former commerce secretary Peter G. Peterson, the chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, the prominent private foreign policy organization that sponsors Foreign Affairs magazine, made a similar plea in a presentation to the American Assembly, a nonpartisan public policy group.
VOTERS DONï¿½ÛªT write the federal budget; thatï¿½Ûªs what they hire politicians for. So a poll of votersï¿½Ûª opinions on budget issues must be interpreted carefully. Take this monthï¿½Ûªs Post-ABC News poll. It shows, for example, that only 22 percent favor defense spending increases, while even fewerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½from 4 to 20 percentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½support cuts in domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and student loans. Since the presidentï¿½Ûªs budget increases defense and cuts the latter, you might conclude that the voters are solidly against it.</br></br>But there is something to the argument, usually made by administration acolytes, that voters are using Mr. Reaganï¿½Ûªs programs as a baseline. They understand that defense has gone up a lot in the Reagan years, and, happy with that, see no need for it to go up much more; they have the sense that domestic spending has been cut, and are cautious about cutting it further. And certainly they come out on Mr. Reaganï¿½Ûªs side on tax increases. By a 68-to-30-percent margin, they agree that taxes should not be increased to cut the deficit.</br></br>Even granting all that, however, the poll does not support the White House position that the people really support the presidentï¿½Ûªs budget, even if the politicians donï¿½Ûªt. Mr. Reaganï¿½Ûªs operatives are quick to argue that weli-connected lobbyists and well-positioned congressmen have kept in place many programs that the public generally doesnï¿½Ûªt particularly want and for whose continued existence there are only the flimsiest of arguments. True enough. But added all together, these programs donï¿½Ûªt amount to much. The real dollar cuts in Mr. Reaganï¿½Ûªs budget come in things such as Medicare, Medicaid, housing and student loans.</br></br>When you know that, you understand why that budget doesnï¿½Ûªt have very many votes on the Republican side of the aisle, let alone among the Democrats. Would you like to run for reelection next fallï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pick any state or district you likeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½on a platform of big cuts in medical care and student loans? Not surprisingly, few Republicans are being advised by their pollsters and consultants to do so. The Post-ABC News poll shows, as other polls have shown, and as the results of the political process over the past five years have shown, that the public doesnï¿½Ûªt want big cuts in these programs.</br></br>It wonï¿½Ûªt be easy to reconcile that desire with the publicï¿½Ûªs aversion to tax increases. The polls give little guidance, since voters have no clear sense of the magnitudes of money involved. But reconciling these conflicting goals is the unpleasant business the voters hired the president and Congress to perform, however much both sometimes seem to want to deny it.
WASHINGTON -- The House, in a stunning victory for President Bush, agreed to cut the tax on capital gains, soundly rejecting an alternative proposed by Democratic leaders.</br></br>After weeks of intense lobbying by both sides, the leadership's plan was defeated by a larger-than-expected 239-190 vote. The convincing margin increases the likelihood that a capital gains cut of some sort could become law this year.</br></br>The vote was a blow to the House's newly elected Democratic leadership, particularly Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington and Majority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri. Both had put their personal prestige on the line to defeat the tax-cut measure, which represented their first major showdown with the Bush administration.</br></br>Still, fully one-quarter of their membership -- 64 Democrats -- deserted them and sided with a near-solid phalanx of Republicans. Only one Republican, Doug Bereuter of Nebraska, broke ranks and voted, against the wishes of President Bush, for the Democratic alternative.</br></br>"This was a watershed for us," glowed House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois.
Cyclicals are back!</br></br>Beaten down in the second half of 1994 by rising interest rates and fears of a sharp slowdown this year, economically sensitive stocks have rallied twice in the first two months of 1995. The latest recovery, which started this month, is a clear bet by some investors that the Federal Reserve will be able to engineer a soft landing, slow economic growth coupled with continued low inflation.</br></br>"Investors are concluding that sometime in '95, the Fed will be done tightening and that there will be a resurgence in the economy late this year or perhaps in '96," says Thomas McManus, market strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Some of these [cyclicals] are the stocks that did the worst in '94."</br></br>Weathervanes of the economy, cyclicals rally on economic recoveries but trail in recessions. The group includes paper companies, auto makers and auto-related companies, as well as capital goods and intermediate-goods suppliers.</br></br>The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index shows an upsurge in February, which comes on the heels of a sharp decline during the second half of January. The index had a steady decline in the second half of 1994, culminating in a 52-week low of 273 on Nov. 23. It then made a first run at a comeback, climbing to 305 on Jan. 15, before skidding sharply. The Federal Reserve's move to boost short-term interest rates by an additional half percentage point on Feb. 1 was widely perceived as the last tightening for the foreseeable future and just the touch needed to bring the economy gliding down gently to more sustainable growth levels.
Data released this week by the Commerce Department waved bright red recession flags--orders for durable goods fell 13.2% in August and inflation-adjusted personal income fell 0.3%. President Obama is asking for more time to allow the lackluster recovery to pick up steam. His plan is to move the economy "forward" by keeping the current policy framework in place and adding higher tax rates on income and capital gains. But the new Commerce Department numbers, combined with his stay-the-course approach, point to recession in 2013.</br></br>This administration's economic policy is built on deficit spending, government control over the economy and dependence on the Federal Reserve to buy the government's excess debt. These policies aren't working. They discourage private investment and jobs, and the policies have resulted in high unemployment, weak business confidence and rapidly declining median incomes.</br></br>The signature of our times is the fever for investing in government bonds and $1,700-an-ounce gold rather than in job creation and small businesses. That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.</br></br>These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.</br></br>The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government.
Like Pavlov's dog, which would salivate at the sound of a bell, U.S. stock market investors will these days launch into a buying frenzy at the faintest hint of more monetary stimulus.</br></br>But if Federal Reserve officials' assurances of continued support for the U.S. recovery have released feel-good endorphins among wishful thinkers on Wall Street, their subtle admissions that a third round of "quantitative easing," or QE3, isn't off the table may equally have sent emerging market central bankers into a cold sweat.</br></br>Financial authorities in developing countries fear their economies will be in the line of fire if U.S. economic conditions deteriorate so much that the Fed again starts buying bonds to anchor U.S. interest rates. They know from experience that many of the dollars the Fed injects into the financial system would flow offshore and into their currencies, whose higher yields are more attractive to investors. This "hot money" would push up their exchange rates to the detriment of their exporters and leave their capital markets vulnerable to volatile turns in sentiment.</br></br>If these policy makers were to respond to QE3 as many did to QE2--by buying dollars in the foreign exchange market, cutting interest rates or otherwise quelling exchange rate appreciation--they would revive what Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega alarmingly described in 2010 as a "currency war." With their export leaders complaining of a loss of competitiveness, central bankers would come under immense political pressure to protect vital industries and to go soft on inflation, often a byproduct of a weaker currency. And this time, global conditions are such that their actions could set off a self-perpetuating cycle of competing devaluations that does considerable damage to the world trading system.</br></br>Unlike in 2010, China's economy is now slowing. Meanwhile, Europe is in an austerity-led recession and the modestly improved U.S. economy faces a major test when steep fiscal cuts take effect at year-end. QE3 could easily land in a world of weakening global demand, which means exporters from places like South Korea, Turkey, Brazil and South Africa would be fighting over a shrinking pie. The temptation to fight lost competitiveness with market intervention rather than by curtailing domestic costs would be great.
Internet banks have run into all kinds of problems in the U.S., but ING Group NV thinks it has some solutions. Part of its strategy: biscotti and comfy sofas.</br></br>Last month, the big Dutch banking and insurance concern launched its ING Direct Internet bank in the Northeastern U.S. The move was the first phase of a rollout of online banking services across the country that could take several years. In the U.S., ING will be adapting strategies that already are luring many Canadians.</br></br>Starting as a telephone operation, ING Direct in Canada didn't even have Internet service until late 1998. But the online bank already has more than 300,000 clients and over three billion Canadian dollars (US$2 billion) in deposits in the country.</br></br>Like its competitors, ING attracts deposits mainly by offering easy access to accounts and beating traditional banks on interest rates. It is offering a 6.5% rate on U.S. savings accounts, for instance. But unlike many Internet banks, ING Direct targets mainly ordinary consumers rather than computer sophisticates or affluent folk with online brokerage accounts. Then it stretches to put a human face on its machine-based business.</br></br>To help do this, it runs cafes that serve up generous helpings of banking information as well as espresso and biscotti. Among other functions, the cafes calm potential customers worried that their savings will somehow vanish into cyberspace. With its sofa, armchairs and popular music, the cafe on the ground floor of a Toronto office tower looks like any striving-to-be-hip coffeehouse. Giant wooden clogs and a model windmill attest to the bank's Dutch origins.
The Bush budget policy continues to be awful. But the recent proposal for personal accounts in Social Security is at least half- excellent. If the administration can show the flexibility to recant one key error, it may deserve to win the coming battle in Congress.</br></br>First, what's excellent? Unlike many versions of pension privatization, the Bush personal accounts are not a giveaway to Wall Street. The government would administer the personal accounts and control the short list of investment options, so salesmen would get no opportunity to push junk funds with enormous hidden fees onto unwary workers.</br></br>The Bush plan is not a giveaway to account holders, either. Pension privatization in Britain, and the leading reform proposal from the Social Security commission in President Bush's first term, involved taxpayer subsidies to those who opted for personal accounts: A policy that was supposed to fix the future budget hole actually wound up enlarging it. The new Bush proposal, by contrast, is intended to be roughly budget-neutral (although more on this later). The new proposal also takes a decent shot at protecting investors from their own folly. Unless workers explicitly demanded otherwise, their savings would go into a "life cycle" account that shifts money from stocks to bonds as they get older. That way they're protected from a possible stock market crash on the eve of their retirement. Admittedly, some high-rolling 64-year-olds will still punt on equities and get burned. But millions of poor workers who accepted the default life-cycle option would retire richer.</br></br>The leading reform proposal in Bush's first term said that individuals could set aside 4 percent of their pay (up to the payroll tax cap, currently $90,000) in personal accounts, but that the maximum anyone could set aside per year was $1,000. In his new proposal, however, the president added a promise to phase out that $1,000 cap. This may sound like an innocent change. But it turns a plausible plan into a crazy one.</br></br>The phaseout kills the progressivity in personal accounts. Under the old proposal, a worker earning up to $25,000 could divert 4 percent into his account, whereas a worker on $90,000-plus could divert just over 1 percent; the opportunity to earn superior investment returns was to be concentrated among workers who most needed it. But if Bush phases out the $1,000 cap, that progressivity will ultimately be eliminated.
mid-1990, Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs Corp. has downgraded about $650 billion of corporate debt obligations and upgraded only $115 billion. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The degree of leverage in U.S. corporations today is so high that the median rating on U.S. corporate bonds Is now ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½BB.ï¿½Ûª a speculative-grade rating," said Leo C. Oï¿½ÛªNeill, S&P president and chief rating officer, in the July 1 issue of Creditweek. Ten years ago, the median was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½A.ï¿½Ûª ï¿½Û That contrast goes to the heart of the problem that has affected the quality of corporate bond issues in recent years and will for some time. The heavy issuance of debt by corporations during the 1980s created a situation in which the corporations had to service this debtï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that is, pay the semiannual interestï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and pay back the principal at maturity.</br></br>Servicing the debt comes mainly from earnings and, for some companies, from the sale of assets. Some issuers of debt, especially retailers with below-investment-grade ratings Gunk bonds), became so extended that it was thought a virtual impossibility that they could service their debt when they issued their bonds in the late 1980s.</br></br>As the country slipped into the 1990 recession, many issuers who were marginal credits at best ran into problems paying their debt interest as their earnings fell.</br></br>Consider a hypothetical example of a company with $100 million in debt outstanding, at an interest cost of 10 percent per year, or $10 million. In normal times, letï¿½Ûªs suppose that our company had $20 million available for interest or fixed-charge payments. A credit rating analyst would say that the interest coverage was $2 of earnings for every $1 of interest, and with that kind of coverage, an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Aï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª rating would probably be assigned to the company.</br></br>In the mid-1980s, our company became aggressive and added another $75 million of debt at the same interest rate. Assuming no increase in revenue, our company must now pay $17.5 million a year in interest, and the fixed-charge coverage falls to $1.14 for each dollar of interest owed. The rating agency would lower the credit rating to BBB.
WASHINGTON -- With few clear signs of economic recovery on the horizon, the Federal Reserve Board moved to bring down short-term interest rates.</br></br>By a 4-1 vote, the Fed board agreed to cut its discount interest rate by half a percentage point, to 5.5% from 6%. The discount rate -- the rate the Fed charges on loans to financial institutions -- is largely symbolic. But in conjunction with the move, the Fed also quietly lowered its target for the important federal funds interest rate to 5.75% from 6%. Other interest rates are expected to fall in turn.</br></br>The Fed's move followed several days of international meetings at which the Bush administration argued vehemently but unsuccessfully for global interest-rate cuts. President Bush was quick to praise the Fed's action, saying it was "very good news" and showed "a very strong leadership role by the Fed."</br></br>The Fed's action comes as the Bush administration has begun considering whether to reappoint Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman when his term expires in August. Some administration officials -- including Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu -- have been critical of Mr. Greenspan because of the Fed's reluctance to cut rates. But administration officials said Mr. Bush's praise yesterday is a sign that he is likely to reappoint Mr. Greenspan.</br></br>Officials familiar with the Fed's deliberations say the board has been debating the rate-cutting move for several weeks. Mr. Greenspan and Fed Governor David Mullins are said to have become increasingly concerned about signs of continued weakness among manufacturers. But Governors Wayne Angell, John LaWare and Edward Kelley were all reluctant to move.
DETROIT -- Sales of domestic cars dropped into low gear in mid-August, indicating that the auto industry's economic recovery is proceeding at only a halting pace.</br></br>The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of North American-made cars dropped to 6.1 million vehicles in the Aug. 11-20 period, down from a 6.5 million pace in the previous month. During the mid-August period last year, cars sold at a seven million-vehicle rate. The slump came despite increased discounts on outgoing 1991 models and even some newly launched 1992 cars.</br></br>"Consumers are still concerned about lagging incomes, the stubbornly high unemployment rate and the increases in state and local taxes -- all of which have acted to diminish consumers' ability to make purchases," said Richard Curtin, who measures consumer confidence at the University of Michigan.</br></br>Still, Mr. Curtin and other experts agreed that the U.S. economy is in a slow recovery. The weak sales of the period don't necessarily foreshadow a slide back into recession, Mr. Curtin said. "We see them as a signal that confirms our expectation of a sluggish recovery."</br></br>In all, the 10 U.S. auto makers sold 143,480 domestically built cars in mid-August, a 10.7% decline from a year ago. Sales of U.S.-built trucks dropped 10.6% from a year ago to 90,032 vehicles.

Now that the stock rally has boomed ahead for more than six months and pushed up the Dow Jones industrials more than 450 points, some investment pros say it's time to begin selective selling.</br></br>Soon it will be "time for aggressive accounts to start taking some chips off the table," says Alfred Goldman, chief technical analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. He points out that many of the people who might invest in stocks already have: "To find a bear, you almost have to look under a rock."</br></br>For investors who want to trim back, market professionals offer several guidelines on how to prune holdings. Among their suggestions:</br></br>-- Sell losers, not just winners.</br></br>-- Shed issues that have climbed to breathtaking heights.
Mayor Marion Barry, facing a much larger potential city budget deficit this year than he had expected, promised yesterday that his administration would do a better job of handling the budget problem than it did when confronted with u similar crisis in 1980.</br></br>Barry, speaking at his monthly press conference, said that while he will not propose tax increases for</br></br>D.C. residents who already face the areaï¿½Ûªs heaviest tax burden, lie would not rdle out signing tax increase pro-</br></br>He said there will be no cutbacks in education, corrections, the police force or the fire department, but indicated that all other city agencies and functions are potential targets. He reiterated a promise that there would be no layoffs of city workers during the next four years.</br></br>Barryï¿½Ûªs disclosure over the weekend of a potential $110 million deficitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½just over 5 percent of the Districtï¿½Ûªs total budget of about $2 billionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½comes less than a month after his successful reelection campaign in which he took credit for having resolved the earlier budget crisis and a week after city officials said they expected a shortfall in city revenues of about $20 million.
FRANKFURT -- Inflation in the euro zone rose sharply in March, pushing back expectations of a European Central Bank interest-rate cut even as economic sentiment softened and the bank pumped more funds into strained money markets.</br></br>Inflation in the 15 countries that share the euro rose to 3.5% in March from a year earlier, up from 3.3% in February and the highest since the series began in January 1997.</br></br>ECB policy makers have said rising food and energy prices will keep inflation above their preferred range of just less than 2% most of this year, but the March surge suggests inflation could stay higher longer than expected and spill over into wages and other prices.</br></br>Investors and many analysts now expect the ECB to defer a rate cut until September at the earliest, rather than June, as previously anticipated.</br></br>"The inflation news looks a whole lot worse than we'd expected; therefore, to get rate cuts as soon as June, the economic or financial situation has to deteriorate much more rapidly than we've seen," said Ken Wattret, an economist with BNP Paribas in London.
President Bush warned Congress and the nation that the country will long remain vulnerable to terrorism, as he pledged to devote the second year of his presidency to combating the recession at home and enemies abroad.</br></br>In his first State of the Union address, Bush laid out a justification for a longer and broader war against terrorism that would expand into a campaign to encourage education and democratic values in the Islamic world.</br></br>The president portrayed the threat in stark terms, disclosing that U.S. forces in Afghanistan have found diagrams of U.S. nuclear power plants and that "tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large." And he said hostile nations, including North Korea, Iraq and Iran, represent "an axis of evil" that is attempting to develop nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.</br></br>Seeking support for the largest increase in defense spending in 20 years, Bush said "The United States of America will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons."</br></br>Bush also outlined his strategy for prodding the United States back to prosperity. He said he would strive to create new opportunities for work, cushion the impact of unemployment, and foster a new ethic of volunteerism within communities.
Americans are borrowing more to pay for college while reducing other debt as a weak job market prompts more people to go to school and tuition keeps climbing, new Federal Reserve Bank of New York data show.</br></br>Americans owed $904 billion in student loans at the end of March, nearly 8% more than a year ago, the New York Fed said Thursday in a quarterly report on consumer credit. That compares with the $679 billion they owed on credit cards at the end of the first quarter.</br></br>Between the fourth quarter of 2008, when credit-card debt peaked, and the first quarter of 2012, this borrowing fell by $187 billion, or 21.6%, the Fed said. Over the same period, student-loan debt rose by 41.4%, or $264 billion.</br></br>Americans are reducing their overall debt burden, a process known as deleveraging that began with the financial crisis. Total household debt--including mortgage, student, credit-card and auto loans--has fallen by roughly 10% since borrowing peaked in mid-2008. It stood at $11.44 trillion as of March 31, the New York Fed said.</br></br>Mortgage borrowing is down significantly, the consequence of foreclosures, falling home values, tighter lending standards and weak home sales.
In Wall Street's leading corporate drama, it's not the opening act that worries investors. It's the encore.</br></br>What investors fear most these days about Microsoft's antitrust case isn't so much an AT&T-style breakup, but rather "conduct remedies" that could hobble Microsoft much as International Business Machines was legally hamstrung in the 1970s and 1980s.</br></br>Investors and analysts still expect Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to endorse the government's proposal to break Microsoft into two: one company focusing on computer operating systems, the other on application and Internet software. Even if the ruling isn't overturned on appeal, it might not be so bad in and of itself, some investors say.</br></br>"What if, 18 months ago, Bill Gates said: `We're getting too big, we're gonna split into three companies,'" muses Charles Carlson, manager of the $145 million Strong Dow 30 Value Fund, which has a stake in Microsoft. If a breakup had been proposed in that way, Mr. Carlson says: "The stock would have gone up 50%."</br></br>Well, it didn't. And now, investors increasingly are worrying about the lessobvious conduct remedies, which have been proposed and are expected to be included in Judge Jackson's ruling. As in: new rules governing Microsoft's relations with computer makers, Windows pricing and the disclosure of computer source code. These rules are designed to restrain Microsoft from abusing its monopoly in the software business and would expire in three years if Microsoft were broken upor 10 years if it isn't.
Stocks followed bonds sharply higher today, as investors sifted through several economic reports and decided that there is a chance the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates in the near future.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average gained 36.98 points to close at 4647.54. The price of the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended with a gain of $4.69 per $1,000 in face value in shortened pre-holiday trading. Its yield fell to 6.61 percent from 6.65 percent late Thursday.</br></br>Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 11 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume was relatively light in pre-holiday trading -- 255.72 million shares, down from 300.9 million Thursday.</br></br>Broad market indexes lagged blue chips but managed some gains, as technology stocks turned in a mixed performance. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.20 to 535.66, topping its closing record set on Thursday; the NYSE composite index climbed 1.23 to 303.23; and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.96 to 563.84. But the Nasdaq index fell 0.60 to 1019.51.</br></br>The market started the day slightly lower, after the Labor Department reported a surprising 0.1-percentage point drop in the nation's unemployment rate in August, to 5.6 percent.
Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.</br></br>And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?</br></br>Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.</br></br>Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.</br></br>Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end. But the reasons to doubt the current bear-market consensus go beyond that line of analysis.
The Fed is in no hurry to launch new measures to boost economic growth, minutes from the central bank's most recent meeting showed, disappointing investors eager for more stimulus.</br></br>Among the hints dropped in minutes of the Fed's March 13 policy gathering, Federal Reserve staff concluded that the U.S. economy is a little more susceptible to inflation than previously thought. That and other signals suggested that another round of bond buying by the Fed to push down long-term interest rates isn't imminent.</br></br>The news disappointed financial markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by as much as 1% before recovering slightly to finish down 64.94 points at 13199.55. Treasurys also fell, sending yields higher.</br></br>The minutes, released Tuesday afternoon, with the customary three-week lag following the meeting, noted that "a couple" of officials said additional stimulus could become necessary if the economy lost momentum or inflation receded.</br></br>But that sounded a bit more timid than a January meeting, when the Fed said "a few" officials thought bond buying could be needed "before long."
EVER SINCE Walter E. Fauntroy first took the floor of the House as the District of Columbiaï¿½Ûªs lone, voteless emissary to Congress, heï¿½Ûªs had this impossible dream: that someday, two-thirds of the members would vote to let the people who live here have full-fledged senators and representatives in Congress. Fat chance, said those faceless ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½longtime Capitol Hill observers.ï¿½Û But yesterday, thanks to Mr. Fauntroyï¿½Ûªs faith and footworkï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and a superb campaign by the Self-Determination for D.C. national and local coalitionsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the House did say yes, with a solid 289-to-127 vote. Moreover, the members capped it with two emotional standing ovations for the teary-eyed delegate from the District. It was, as House Majority Leader Jim Wright (D-Tex.) proclaimed exuberantly, a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½great day in the history of human freedom,ï¿½Û reflecting the belief that there is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no such thing as a second-class American.ï¿½Û</br></br>Well, you canï¿½Ûªt be sure about thatï¿½ï¿½ï¿½for now itï¿½Ûªs on to the Senate, where things are a bit clubbier. Nevertheless. we like to believe that most senators today recognize that the issue is not one of political ideology, but of good democratic government, of something that is right. Certainly the vote in the House reflected that sentiment, with support coming from 228 Democrats and 61 Republicans from all points on the political spectrum.</br></br>In any event, before the Senate begins serious consideration of the measure, a brief time-out is in order, we submit, to thank those who were instrumental in building the impressive House vote. The support of</br></br>President Carter, Vice President Mondale and the leadership of the House was more than lip service; the administration lobbied intelligently and diligently, as did Rep. Don Edwards (D-Calif.), chairman of the subcommittee handling the resolution, and floor manager; Judiciary Committee Chairman Peter W. Rodino Jr. (D-N.J.); and, among the Republicans, John Hall Buchanan Jr. of Alabama and Robert Mc-Clory and Tom Railsback of Illinois.</br></br>With that as impetus yesterday, a cross-section of senatorsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½including Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), Birch Bayh (D-Ind.l, Charles McC. Mathias Jr. (R-Md.j and Barry M. Goldwater (R-Ariz.)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½signed a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Dear Colleague" letter urging Senate approval of the resolution. In their letter, the senators rightly emphasize that all the leading constitutional scholars who testified before the House hearings said they found no constitutional problems in letting the District have two senators.
MONTREAL ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The more Canadaï¿½Ûªs trade deficit with the United States is considered, the more it seems probable that the new Conservative government will have to leave it just where its predecessors. the Liberals, left it ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½in the hands of the gods I and at the mercy of strong natural forces.</br></br>I The substantial visible deficit is now being more than 1 made up by the inflow of . capital investment. The Ca-[ nauian dollar stands at a pre-, mium in New York. If the inward flow of capital stops , or even slackens substantial-> ly, the dollar will right itself and other natural forces will reduce the deficit.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ The loose talk in which cer-' tain Canadian publications and public men have in-j dulged. all of it based on r some assumption that natural t economic forces can be vio-. lenily deflected by government action, is more and . more being seen as merely I loose talk.</br></br>1 A GREAT PART of the present United States invest-* meat is based on the need of ' big American producers for . raw materials. They invest in this country because it suits titeir overall pattern of production and distribution, 1 not because they want con-1 sciously to dominate Canada, t This was well brought out i by the recent report on Can-I adaï¿½Ûªs economic prospects. An i analysis of that report by Prof. Jacob Viner of Prince-s ton. a Canadian-born econo-3 mist of international repute, t points out that if Canadians \f had been financially able to develop their own resources, s United States companies r would have been glad to buy the product.</br></br>It is now dawning on some 1 of the critics of the resulting r situation that the postwar e boom in Canaria was founded c on these investments and on
IRVINE, Calif. -- Financial Corp. of America said that its new auditor questioned the thrift holding company's future as a going concern and disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is planning an investigation of the concern's previous practices in establishing loan-loss reserves.</br></br>The disclosures came as Financial Corp. announced an expected $512.1 million fourth-quarter loss, one of the largest losses ever posted by a financial concern in the U.S.</br></br>Financial Corp.'s new auditor, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell & Co., issued a qualified opinion on the company's balance sheet, saying that Financial Corp.'s ability to continue as a going concern depends on "the company achieving a profitable level of operations . . . market interest rates and the continuing forbearance of the federal and California state regulatory authorities."</br></br>Peat Marwick also declined to give an opinion on the company's income statement, changes in stockholders' equity, changes in financial position for 1984, and on whether accounting principles in 1984 financial statements were consistent with those of the prior years.</br></br>Meanwhile, the company's 10K statement said the SEC plans a probe of loan-loss reserves. But the statement said the commission's staff won't recommend any enforcement action from its previous inquiry on accounting for transactions involving the purchase and immediate resale of properties by the company's American Savings & Loan Associaton unit in 1980 and 1981.
WASHINGTON -- With the nation's underlying inflation falling, the Federal Reserve yesterday softened its hawkish inflation stance a bit while squelching any suggestion it might cut interest rates soon.</br></br>The central bank, in the statement issued at the end of its two-day meeting, sidestepped the question of whether the current inflation rate is low enough. It emphasized that the outlook for inflation -- and not the latest inflation reading -- is now driving its interest- rate decisions. On that score, the Fed reiterated that its "predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected."</br></br>As widely expected, the Fed's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee left its short-term interest-rate target at 5.25%, where it has been for almost exactly a year.</br></br>In the accompanying statement, it said, that "readings on core inflation," which excludes food and energy, "have improved modestly in recent months," a more optimistic assessment than at its last meeting, on May 9, when it said "core inflation remains somewhat elevated."</br></br>But it added: "Sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated. Moreover, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures."
Retailers in the metropolitan area, while relatively optimistic about sales tor the remainder of the year, agfee that a scheduled pay increase for 300,000 federal white-collar .workers will have little or no effect on- business.</br></br>In fact, a survey of several leading Washington-area merchants yesterday showed that they really havenï¿½Ûªt factored the pay increase into their store plans. Whatï¿½Ûªs more, they donï¿½Ûªt intend to make any adjustments based on President Reaganï¿½Ûªs recommendation, of a 4.8 percent pay hike for white-collar employes.</br></br>Moreover, several merchants pointed out that federal employment in the Washington region is no longer the dominant sector of the work force. It has been replaced by the rapidly growing services industry.</br></br>On the other hand, if the same group of federal employes had succeeded in winning White House approval of a 15.1 percent pay increase, the. effect would he quite significant where retail sales are concerned.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think it would," agreed Robert J. Mulligan, vice chairman of Woodward & Lnthrnp Inc., the region's biggest department store chain. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thatï¿½Ûªs a pretty hefty increase, and I think it has a psychological effect,ï¿½Û Mulligan said of the 15.1 percent that had been proposed earlier.
The Bush administration has proposed ending fixed-rate consolidations of federal student loans just as interest rates are forecast to plunge to record lows. With lower interest rates, student borrowers could save thousands of dollars over the life of their loans.</br></br>White House officials raised the idea of ending the government- subsidized consolidations as part of a supplementary spending bill for the current fiscal year being developed by the House Appropriations Committee.</br></br>The proposal is one of three preliminary suggestions forwarded by the White House to deal with a $1.3 billion shortfall in the Pell Grant program for low-income students. It ran into immediate opposition from congressional Democrats, some Republicans and student advocates who said it would effectively raise interest rates for the estimated 700,000 borrowers who consolidate, or refinance their total federal student loan debt, each year.</br></br>"At a time when we are looking for ways to make college more affordable, it is inconceivable that the Bush White House would send a proposal to Congress that would make it harder for working families to pay tuition bills," Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) said yesterday.</br></br>Rep. George Miller (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the proposal "grossly unfair to students" who borrowed billions "with the promise they could consolidate and get a better interest rate. Now, when they have to pay back the loans, the Bush administration wants to change the rules and increase repayment costs to graduates."
The International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Treasury have abandoned their short-lived policy of benign neglect and come galloping back into Latin America. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, in the region this week, is no longer talking tough love. With the recent bailout of Uruguay and a deal for Brazil in the works, he's no longer practicing it either. Will they never learn?</br></br>After more than $250 billion of assistance to debtor countries in the swinging 1990s, new management at the IMF and Treasury took a new tack. No more bailouts of badly run economies! No more money to defend exchange rates! Losses would teach the virtues of due diligence and careful risk evaluation.</br></br>This was not a punitive, small-minded assessment. The judgment was that the IMF rescue operations, assisted or even developed by Treasury, had increased risk by encouraging too much borrowing. Instead of taking in risk capital by offering equity, companies in emerging markets could hold on to their equity and leverage earnings by borrowing dollars from local banks. The local banks borrowed dollars from foreign lenders but lent in local currency. This added a currency risk to the banks' default risk. When foreign lenders became nervous about the size of the borrowing country's or banks' repayment obligations, they did not renew their loans. A run soon started against local banks, currency and government debt.</br></br>This policy reached a peak in the Clinton years, when Mexico, Russia, Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brazil, Argentina, and others received massive IMF, Treasury, and multilateral loans to bail out banks and pay off foreign lenders. Often, the foreign banks renewed their loans, on more profitable terms, after the IMF put in new money.</br></br>Wall Street worshipped at the Robert Rubin-Larry Summers shrine. The bankers collected fees for renegotiating the debt. They declared these policies successful because they were repaid, even though countries like Mexico, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia suffered deep recessions and ended with larger debts.
We are currently in the most anemic economic recovery in the memory of most Americans. Declining consumer sentiment and business concerns over policy uncertainty weigh on the minds of all of us. We must fix our economy's growth and jobs machine.</br></br>We can do this. The U.S. economy has the talent, ideas, energy and capital for the robust economic growth that has characterized much of America's experience in our lifetimes. Our standard of living and the nation's standing as a world power depend on restoring that growth.</br></br>But to do so we must have vastly different policies aimed at stopping runaway federal spending and debt, reforming our tax code and entitlement programs, and scaling back costly regulations. Those policies cannot be found in the president's proposals. They are, however, the core of Gov. Mitt Romney's plan for economic recovery and renewal.</br></br>In response to the recession, the Obama administration chose to emphasize costly, short-term fixes--ineffective stimulus programs, myriad housing programs that went nowhere, and a rush to invest in "green" companies.</br></br>As a consequence, uncertainty over policy--particularly over tax and regulatory policy--slowed the recovery and limited job creation. One recent study by Scott Baker and Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University and Steven Davis of the University of Chicago found that this uncertainty reduced GDP by 1.4% in 2011 alone, and that returning to pre-crisis levels of uncertainty would add about 2.3 million jobs in just 18 months.
One of the questions facing Congress as it moves toward action on an urban aid package is whether enterprise zones represent an efficient way to fight poverty.</br></br>The long-range urban aid legislation now being discussed in Congress almost certainly will include such zones, which some conservative Republicans have advocated as sound urban policy for the last decade.</br></br>President Bush has made enterprise zones a key part of his proposed six-point urban agenda. Democratic leaders of Congress have expressed a willingness to accept enterprise them under certain conditions, and big-city mayors also expressed support for the idea this week at their national conference in Houston.</br></br>At its core, such legislation would authorize tax breaks to attract businesses to distressed areas. If enacted, it would breach a consensus, reached in the 1986 tax bill, against using the tax code for other than fiscal purposes.</br></br>The types of tax breaks that the federal government should offer is another issue in the current debate. The administration wants to rely more heavily on cuts in capital gains taxes, while Democratic congressional leaders have emphasized tax credits for creating jobs.
Wendy's Co. is focused on investing in long-term brand-building efforts--like its new breakfast menu, restaurant designs and marketing strategy--after posting strong sales for the fourth quarter. But the restaurant operator might be biting off more than it can chew.</br></br>On Monday, Wendy's shares fell 3.8% to $5.01 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, following the company's investor day, when analysts questioned the sustainability of Wendy's recent growth trends, given continued commodities head winds, general economic uncertainty and the high cost of carrying out all of its turnaround efforts.</br></br>Wendy's said it hopes to spur long-term growth by investing this year in menu innovation, continuing tests of its new breakfast menu and even-newer Black Label premium burgers. Its other major long-term sales driver is its portfolio of four new restaurant-design prototypes that are more modern and entice diners to eat inside, where they typically spend more money.</br></br>"McDonald's is investing billions into its facilities.

"We are clearly not the cool place to go to these days."</br></br>The new remodels bring in flat-screen TVs, Wi-Fi, a clear view of the kitchen and other elements that Wendy's says have given its competitors an advantage with consumers in recent years.
By all accounts, Catherine B. Dunlevy helped turn a small, nonprofit company into a national leader in the booming business of providing college students with tuition money. From her Washington and Herndon offices, Dunlevy oversees a firm that has lent $1.5 billion to 250,000 students since it was founded 11 years ago.</br></br>The company has been profitable for Dunlevy. As chairman and chief executive of EduCap Inc., she makes almost $600,000 annually, drives a company-leased Mercedes, rents a company-owned luxurious town house and racked up nearly $100,000 in business expenses in one year recently.</br></br>Six-figure salaries and executive perks were nonexistent when EduCap -- known until recently as University Support Services -- was founded by a local Catholic priest to make loans to struggling students. Exempted from federal taxes, its avowed charitable purpose was -- and still is -- to help "make education affordable for American families," according to the firm's promotional materials.</br></br>But over the years, the company has fallen out of favor with some college financial aid officers who assert that its mission now seems to be not just making loans but also making money to support extravagant salaries and administrative costs. In 1992, it plunked down $462,000 to buy the town house that Dunlevy now rents. Its top officers also hold stock in a for-profit company that draws almost all its business from EduCap without competitive bidding.</br></br>Experts ask the same question of EduCap that surrounds the multilayered federally guaranteed student loan programs: If costs were kept down, couldn't interest rates for students be lower? They also question whether, given the growing number of for-profit companies offering alternative loans, EduCap should still enjoy tax-exempt status.
A dreary jobs report released last week has driven home what most political insiders already thought: The presidential election of 2012 will be largely about the economy, particularly how high the unemployment rate is on Election Day.</br></br>Yet joblessness is an incomplete and inadequate measure of a broader economic malaise that forms the real backdrop for the coming campaign.</br></br>The deeper problem -- the one that feeds a sense of economic dissatisfaction and anxiety in the land -- is what Republican presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman referred to last week as a "lost decade of growth."</br></br>In other words, the issue isn't just the recession that began in December 2007, or President Barack Obama's obvious difficulty in pulling the nation out of it. It's the fact that the American economy hasn't been a robust producer of growth and jobs for a long time, beginning well before the recession.</br></br>Americans sense this, which is why polls show they fear for their future and that of their kids. The party that creates some confidence that it can fix this underlying growth problem is the one that will have the real advantage.
U.S.</br></br>AARP, the powerful lobbying group for older Americans, is dropping its longstanding opposition to cutting Social Security benefits. Given the group's immense clout, the shift could dramatically affect the debate over the future of the federal safety net, from pensions to health care. Separately, a House subcommittee that oversees Social Security called for an investigation into how judges approve disability benefits. Over at Biden's bipartisan debt-reduction talks, officials familiar with the talks said they expected Medicaid to be the biggest source of cuts in federal entitlement programs in whatever compromise emerges. And White House officials this week told lawmakers in the Biden group that Obama would be open to payroll tax breaks for employers and employees, as fresh concerns over slowing job growth spill into the talks.</br></br>The potential for a persistent slowdown in hiring is the biggest threat to the U.S. recovery, according to economists in a Wall Street Journal survey who now expect the economy to add about 2.2 million jobs over the next 12 months, down from last month's forecast of 2.5 million jobs. Good employees are still prized: Many U.S. companies that cut 401(k) matching contributions during the recession are starting to restore them, or a slimmed-down version of them, to reward and retain staff amid the decline of traditional pension plans and mounting concern over the long-term viability of Social Security.</br></br>The head of the ATF is expected to be ousted over the anti-gun-trafficking operation that has grown into the agency's biggest scandal in decades.</br></br>Only 35% of fourth-graders knew the purpose of the Declaration of Independence in taking the latest national history test.
Deciding on which country's debt to invest in comes down to three basic points, said bond king Bill Gross, which include a central bank's ability to use low or negative real interest rates to reflate its economy without creating a currency crisis.</br></br>In his monthly missive, the managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co. said, "2010 promises to be the year of choosing 'which government' can most successfully substitute the governments' fist for Adam Smith's invisible hand and for how long. Can individual countries escape a debt crisis by creating even more debt and riding another rocking horse winner? Can the global economy?"</br></br>To figure that out, Mr. Gross wrote there are many conditions, and they vary by country, but they boil down to three:</br></br>--Can a country issue its own currency and is it acceptable in global commerce?</br></br>--Are a country's initial conditions (outstanding debt, structural deficit, growth rate, demographic balance) moderate and can it issue future public debt as a substitute for private credit?
Google, the popular Internet search engine, offers a page called Google News, a summary of what's going on in the world produced entirely by computers. Well, I say "entirely," but Google's computers don't actually gather the news. What they do is scan thousands of other Web pages and, using a secret formula, decide what the top stories are. Then they cleverly lift headlines and other material from different news sources, add links to these and other sites, and come up with what appears to be the Web site of an extremely cosmopolitan newspaper.</br></br>It's slightly a bluff. Who knows why the computers chose to feature a New Zealand news site the other day as a way of covering the Miss World imbroglio in Nigeria? But you have to suspect that the explanation lies in the crudeness of the computer's judgment, not its sophistication. Google concedes that its choices of stories and news sources are "occasionally unusual and contradictory," but insists with uncharacteristic pomposity, "it is exactly this variety that makes Google News a valuable source of information on the important issues of the day."</br></br>Which is humbug. People still do it better. But not by much. The day is clearly approaching when editors can be replaced by computers. This requires some urgent rethinking.</br></br>Throughout the revolution of technology and globalization that has been going on for two decades, responsible mainstream commentators, pundits, analysts and miscellaneous gasbags (including this one) have taken the view that progress is a good thing. Some people are unfortunately caught in the gears of change, but society as a whole benefits. It's not very complicated if you know a bit of economics. You've got your "invisible hand" (that's free markets), you've got your "comparative advantage" (that's free trade), you've got your "perennial gale of creative destruction" (that's competition and new technology), you've got your "can't make an omelet without breaking eggs" (that's attributed to Joseph Stalin, but never mind). The losers in this process deserve sympathy and help, but special pleading must not be allowed to thwart or slow this process.</br></br>We must distinguish, however, between special pleading and legitimate alarm about deeply troubling developments. It is one thing to sacrifice textile workers and auto workers on the altar of progress. It is quite another to start throwing journalists into the flames. And the difference is? Well, it's very different. Completely different. Couldn't be more different, quite frankly, my good madam, because . . . because . . . well, it occurs to me that I'm a journalist. This puts the situation in a new perspective.
THE STATE OF WASHINGTON seems like an ideal place to film a beer commercial involving lumberjacks. Or at least, that's what executives at Stroh Brewery Co. figured. But Washington wasn't the setting originally proposed for a coming ad. "The ad agency was going to shoot it in northern California and have some logs trucked in," says Hunter Hastings, vice president, brand management, at Stroh. He quickly vetoed that idea and insisted that the location be switched to Washington to avoid the expense of simulating a logging operation.</br></br>Such a change might not have been demanded a year or two ago. But Stroh and other big advertisers have recently begun reining in their ad agencies in an attempt to control the volatile costs of producing TV commercials. "The ad agencies are very much at fault," says Mr. Hastings. "They want to win prizes for creativity and think the way to do that is to spend as much money as possible."</br></br>On average, the cost of making commercials surged 99% between 1979 and 1984, more than double the growth rate of the consumer price index, according to a recent study by the Association of National Advertisers. Fueling the increase: Elaborate special effects, greater use of music, more expensive cameras and lighting equipment and longer shooting schedules. The time required to produce a typical ad increased to 13.3 hours in 1984 from 10.1 hours in 1979, and most of that increase was charged as overtime. "It's a constant tug of war," says Spencer Plavoukos, chief executive officer of the SSC&B ad agency. "Clients want to spend less money for commercials, but they also want extravaganzas to stay ahead of one another visually." SSC&B last month hired a production manager to help select directors and production houses that provide the best value for the money.</br></br>PRODUCTION COSTS vary widely, but $100,000 to $200,000 isn't unusual for a 30-second commercial. So this month, American Cyanamid Co. executives visited two of their ad agencies -- Ted Bates and Dancer Fitzgerald Sample -- to show what they call "the good-enough reel." That's a tape of about a dozen commercials, the most expensive of which is $50,000. Miner Raymond, a TV production consultant in Cincinnati, assembled the reel so the company could explain more clearly the level of quality it is willing to accept in ads for such brands as Old Spice and Breck.</br></br>Industry sources say that Procter & Gamble Co., the biggest TV advertiser of all, wants at least 10% of its commercials filmed outside New York and Los Angeles. Hot directors in those cities command $10,000 to $12,000 a day, but some companies believe that for far less, they can get the same quality elsewhere.
Older Internet stocks still are swinging, but they aren't leading the band anymore. As the Nasdaq Stock Market has romped to repeated new highs in recent weeks, it has done so without the help of many Internet stocks that had been so hot in April.</br></br>The Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, though up 59% since its August low, remains 15% below its peak of mid-April; the Nasdaq Composite Index is up 22% in the same period. Hardly any of the stocks in the capitalization -- weighted Internet index now trade anywhere near those highs. America Online and Yahoo! both trade within 20% of their peaks, but the average of the index's 40 components still was down 38% from its 52-week high as of Thursday.</br></br>With three Internet-related initial public offerings of stock in the past three weeks rocketing into the ranks of the top five first-day gains ever, it is clear the Internet party isn't over. It has just moved to a different neighborhood, leaving some lonely guests at the old one.</br></br>"This time last year, e-tailers a la Amazon.com were all the rage," says David Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments, an investment-research and advisory firm in New York. "Now e-tailers, led by Amazon's petulant preference for expansion over profit, are passe, and now it's b-to-b [business to business commerce] and networking."</br></br>Of course, with the broad market rallying, some big Internet "blue chips" could well soon achieve new highs. Signs of modest economic activity and low inflationary pressure helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average soar 174.02 points, or 1.64%, to 10769.32 on Friday, although uncertainty remains on whether the Federal Reserve will raise rates when its policy-making body meets tomorrow. The Nasdaq composite gained 23.86, or 0.75%, to 3221.15, its third consecutive record and its 10th in 11 days. For the week, the Dow industrials gained 64.52, or 0.6%; Nasdaq rose 118.86, or 3.8%.
Your stocks or mutual funds may--or may not--have gained much in value this year. But unless you live in one of a handful of places around the country, you can be certain of this: Your home racked up solid appreciation gains in the last 12 months--5.3 percent on average nationwide, and 8 percent to 9 percent in the hottest statewide markets, such as Massachusetts, Minnesota and Colorado, plus Washington, D.C.</br></br>And unlike your stock market profits, there's an extra layer of icing on top of your home's appreciation: It's tax-free, and it can be readily converted to cash if you need it--which is what growing numbers of American consumers are doing.</br></br>Two new national statistical studies highlight the continuing, impressive jumps underway in home values, and how owners are turning at least some of that appreciated equity into spendable dollars.</br></br>The first study, prepared by a federal agency that monitors the housing economy, documents what gleeful homeowners and sellers suspected: Inflation in most goods and services may be in the range of 1 percent to 2 percent a year, but home values are jumping at four to five times that pace. According to the latest data from the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, even three of the four slowest-appreciating markets--Nevada, Pennsylvania and Idaho, with gains in resale value of 3 percent or less--are beating inflation in the overall economy. (Hawaii posted a scant 0.1 percent appreciation rate during the last 12 months.)</br></br>Massachusetts continues to lead the nation's resale-value boom, with a 9.3 percent average rate of gain per house in the last year, and nearly a 30 percent increase over the last five years. That's especially impressive given Massachusetts' already high-cost housing stock. If you bought a $300,000 house outside Boston last year, it's probably worth about $327,000 today. If you bought it in 1994, it's probably worth about $386,000. Other relatively pricey home real estate areas are not far behind.
Complaining about the actions of senior management, even when it seems you have a solid right to vent, can be a dicey proposition.</br></br>QI was working on a team project where various peers and senior personnel were supposed to contribute pieces of the final product. A senior-level manager assigned a segment of the work by the project manager sent a rude e-mail to me (a mid-level employee) and several of my colleagues, nastily stating that the work she was responsible for was not 'real work' and that she was too busy to do it. After missing a deadline by 11 days and refusing to delegate the work, she sent a very shabby product and denigrated the type of work that we subordinates do.</br></br>I'm over feeling annoyed and offended but am now wondering if anyone, perhaps the project manager, should confront her about her lack of respect for her teammates and the jobs we do. I expect better from my bosses, but is it wise to voice my thoughts? What's the protocol here?</br></br>AKaren Usher, chief executive of TPO Inc., a Tysons Corner human resources outsourcing firm, said the corporate phenomenon of "people in high positions belittling little people is moderately prevalent" and that sometimes "management doesn't do enough to intervene. Most managers are under-trained."</br></br>In this case, she said the first thing is to "seriously consider saying something to the person that sent you that note. If you go over their head, it can make the situation worse.
WASHINGTON -- President-elect George W. Bush is under growing pressure to pack his overall tax-cut plan with more breaks for business -- an area he gave scant attention during the campaign.</br></br>Business lobbyists have flooded the Bush transition team with requests for everything from technical tweaks to global overhauls. And if Mr. Bush rejects adding more business cuts to his $1.6 trillion, 10-year plan, members of Congress are expressing interest in doing it themselves -- likely at the expense of Mr. Bush's big across-the-board rate reduction.</br></br>"Most people are of the opinion that a smaller cut that's more targeted would be better," said Sen. John Breaux, the Louisiana Democrat who is an influential member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. "I think the long-term across-the-board reduction is fine but it's expensive."</br></br>Mr. Breaux cited two business-oriented breaks he favored that he believed Mr. Bush would like: incentives for energy production and credits for health care. While health-care credits would benefit families directly, they also would help insurance companies sign up more customers.</br></br>Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said last week he favored more targeted provisions, including energy breaks and retirement-account reforms. Mr. Grassley said he doesn't sense sufficient support yet for Mr. Bush's across-the-board rate cut, which would provide the biggest sums to the well-to-do, but he added that he plans to keep plugging to win votes for individual rate relief, regardless.
Stock investors marched ahead where bond investors feared to tread.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 7.51 points to 2386.91, another post-crash high, in moderate trading. But higher oil prices and the growing suspicion that the Federal Reserve won't relax its grip on interest rates anytime soon caused long-term bonds to drop slightly. The dollar strengthened as currency traders also had second thoughts about Fed policy.</br></br>As expected, the stock market opened on a down note as investors took profits following the nearly 42-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday. That gain was prompted by a lower-than-expected rise in the March consumer-price index and a sharp drop in housing starts in March. Investors interpreted those figures to mean that the economy is slowing and inflation pressures are fading. But prices quickly recovered and remained higher throughout the day.</br></br>A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, warned that stock investors appear to be buying the argument -- which he rejects -- that a slower economy will be good for stocks because inflationary pressures will ease. He said a long list of economic indicators in recent weeks indicates that the economy is heading toward a recession that will undermine corporate earnings.</br></br>"We just don't think stocks have tremendous upside potential," he said. "It may be somewhat hazardous to respond favorably to those kinds of numbers."
The government's ability to understand and predict hurricanes, drought and climate changes of all kinds is in danger because of deep cuts facing many Earth satellite programs and major delays in launching some of its most important new instruments, a panel of experts has concluded.</br></br>The two-year study by the National Academy of Sciences, released yesterday, determined that NASA's earth science budget has declined 30 percent since 2000. It stands to fall further as funding shifts to plans for a manned mission to the moon and Mars. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, meanwhile, has experienced enormous cost overruns and schedule delays with its premier weather and climate mission.</br></br>As a result, the panel said, the United States will not have the scientific information it needs in the years ahead to analyze severe storms and changes in Earth's climate unless programs are restored and funding made available.</br></br>"NASA's budget has taken a major hit at the same time that NOAA's program has fallen off the rails," said panel co-chairman Berrien Moore III of the University of New Hampshire. "This combination is very, very disturbing, and it's coming at the very time that we need the information most."</br></br>NOAA officials announced last week that 2006 was the warmest year on record in the United States -- part of a highly unusual warming trend over several decades that many scientists attribute to greenhouse gases. Some climate experts think that the atmospheric warming could bring more extreme weather -- longer droughts, reduced snowfall and more intense hurricanes such as the ones experienced along the Gulf Coast in 2005.
It's no exaggeration to say that the 1980s were dominated by economics. The politics and psychology of these 10 years have swirled around the central issue of how nations enhance their wealth. Ronald Reagan's economic policies undergirded his popularity. Communism's economic failure triggered political upheavals in the Soviet Bloc and China. Japan's emergence as a great power primarily reflects its stunning economic success.</br></br>Greedy is the glib label stuck onto the '80s. How silly. Greed had never disappeared; it merely became more conspicuous. The decade's significance lies elsewhere. We rediscovered some old truths about economics. Competition works. It generates economic growth by fostering efficiency and innovation. In the '80s, U.S. living standards and productivity rose. But competition can be rough, and the decade seems baffling precisely because its gains often emerged from disruptive changes.</br></br>We endured fierce foreign competition and the worst recession since World War II. Corporate America was no longer invincible. It faced hostile takeovers as well as rising imports. Companies were forced to become more efficient and to hold down costs and prices. But their responses-layoffs, plant shutdowns and streamlining-were often hurtful and unsettling.</br></br>It's been that kind of confusing decade. Looking back, I'd cite 10 major economic trends that will affect the '90s.</br></br>1) The Triumph of Free Markets: Faith in competition replaced the view that government spending and low interest rates spur economic growth. The result has been stingier government, higher "real" (after-inflation) interest rates and more emphasis on free markets. The change is global. From Mexico to France, state-owned companies have been sold ("privatized"). Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and China are trying market policies.
The stock market's plunge is likely to slow the proliferation of stock-index futures products for at least a few months, according to many in the futures industry.</br></br>Over the past several years, a surge in new stock-index futures trading vehicles has changed the face of major futures exchanges. At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading in the Standard & Poor's Corp. 500-stock index reached nearly 20 million contracts last year. That represented a tenfold rise since 1982 and is more than the total of all futures trading in the U.S. in 1972. Eleven proposals for stock-index products currently are pending before the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</br></br>That regulatory body isn't likely to approve any new stock-index proposals, however, until the current turbulence eases in the stock market itself, some industry officials say.</br></br>"I don't think there's any doubt there will be an impact" on approval of stock-index proposals as a result of the stock market's wild gyrations since mid-October, Robert Wilmouth, president of the National Futures Association, said.</br></br>CFTC officials said they are placing a higher priority on studying recent market events than on approving new contracts. A spokeswoman said the commission doesn't have any stock-index proposals on its calendar for review at present.
CUSTER, S.D. -- Some towns ban liquor sales on election day. Here, liquor sales are on the ballot.</br></br>Pruning government's role in the economy is a hot topic in an election year, and for voters in this Black Hills city, Tuesday will bring a chance to decide whether their municipal government should quit the spirits business.</br></br>South Dakota is one of two Great Plains states -- Minnesota is the other -- where cities and towns own and operate bars and liquor stores. In South Dakota, the practice precedes statehood. City fathers promoted saloons to raise funds from the purchases of ranchers, miners and railroad workers in an era before sales taxes. After Prohibition, communities were allowed to vote on whether they wanted to resume the sale of liquor themselves or let private operators handle the trade.</br></br>Today, 121 South Dakota cities and towns -- several with under 100 residents -- remain in the liquor business. That is just over a third of all the state's municipalities, most of which have fewer than 500 people.</br></br>Many of the stores lose money but hang on, anchoring retail strips in dying farm communities. Others, generally the bigger ones, shovel funds into their cities' coffers each year, thanks to a booze biz monopoly. The store in Brookings, home to the campus of South Dakota State University, had more than $3.4 million in sales last year; Sturgis, $1.7 million.
Washington business leaders yesterday urged the District government to launch a major new effort to manage the booming development in the downtown business district.</br></br>Unless the city gains control of new construction, much of the old business district quickly will be turned into another K Street, a sea of office buildings lacking the amenities that make for a vital downtown, warned the Greater Washington Board of Trade.</br></br>The Board of Trade recommended that Mayor Marion Barry appoint a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½downtown coordinatorï¿½Û as the first step toward planning development in a 50-block area bounded by 15th ï¿½Û¢Street on the west, Third Street on the east. New York and Massachusetts avenues on the north and the Pennsylvania Avenue redevelopment area on the south.</br></br>The business group also asked the city for a series of incentives to subsidize preservation of historic buildings and construction of new facilities to make the downtown ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a people place.ï¿½Û</br></br>The height limit for buildings in the downtown area should be increased from the present 130 feet plus rooftop machinery to 160 feet including rooftop gear, the same height permitted along Pennsylvania Avenue, the Board of Trade recommended.
EXXON AGREED to buy Mobil for stock valued at about $75.3 billion, creating an energy giant in the largest takeover ever and marking an era of low inflation. The deal is likely to attract close antitrust scrutiny, and the two companies face the task of integrating different corporate cultures. Meanwhile, the CBOE is investigating premerger options trading in Mobil.</br></br>Lower oil prices will offer U.S. consumers extra purchasing power, while airlines, railroads, and other companies will reap a windfall.

NEW YORK, May 9ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Blue-chip stocks reached record high ground for the 26th time this year, as investors welcomed a drop in long-term bond interest rates to the lowest level in more than a year.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average ended with a gain of 6.91 points at 4390.78, surpassing Mondayï¿½Ûªs record closing high of 4383.87. In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declining stocks by about 13 to 10 on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>Some analysts said the stock marketï¿½Ûªs rally was uninspiring, and they concluded that investors were mostly content in watching bond prices levitate and precious metals prices tumble.</br></br>"Weï¿½Ûªre taking a breather with no major news,ï¿½Û said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First.</br></br>While investors moved into stocks and bonds on expectations of lower interest rates, funds were liquidating precious metals. On New Yorkï¿½Ûªs Commodity Exchange, spot gold closed $6.20 lower at $383.60 an ounce. Spot silver fell 54.6 cents to $5,448 an ounce.
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke yesterday blamed loose lending for the recent turmoil in the mortgage market and told Congress that "it's worth looking at" the idea of creating a law against certain lending practices.</br></br>Bernanke, testifying at a hearing of Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said Fed policymakers are likely to hold interest rates steady for a while and are more concerned about high inflation than slow economic growth. Stock prices fell as his comments dispelled many investors' hopes that the central bank was preparing to cut interest rates to bolster a weakening expansion.</br></br>The Fed chairman used the hearing to make his first public remarks on why more Americans are falling behind on their mortgage payments and losing their homes to foreclosure, particularly subprime borrowers with poor credit histories, low incomes, no down payments or other factors that put them at higher risk of default. The hearing comes as Congress is trying to assess the causes and figure out what to do in response.</br></br>Bernanke's testimony was also his first since a Senate Banking Committee hearing last week, at which panel chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) blamed the subprime mortgage mess on a failure of the Fed and other bank regulators to enforce federal lending laws.</br></br>The Fed chairman, without explicitly referring to Dodd's criticisms, countered yesterday that lenders had insufficiently gauged many subprime borrowers' ability to repay mortgages, particularly when their payments increase because of rising interest rates.

In a grim assessment of the global economic outlook, the World Bank yesterday said that some of the world's least developed countries already have suffered a slump worse than the Great Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s.</br></br>Although U.S. government officials have shown optimism about the short-term global economic outlook, the present pattern of slow growth among developed nations and in developing countries raises concerns about the longer-term future, said the bank's annual World Development Report.</br></br>The report by the bank's staff was sharply critical of Reagan administration policies, which it said contributed to the "economic turbulence and uncertainty" that have produced high interest rates, declining investment, rising protectionism and high unemployment in Europe.</br></br>Stanley Fisher, chief economist for the bank, acknowledged that "the world economy appears to be in better shape" than when the report was completed a few months ago.</br></br>Fisher acknowledged that the Reagan administration's strategy for dealing with the massive debts of many Third World nations, which avoids debt relief except for impoverished African countries, has left major Latin American debtors in no better shape than they were three years ago.
LATER THIS MONTH, Buick will run magazine ads encouraging consumers to write in for a copy of its 1987 sales brochure. But not just anyone will qualify for one, and it will hardly be your run-of-the-mill auto catalog. What the General Motors division plans to do is mail 20,000 floppy disks to users of Apple personal computers. The strategy: Create a high-tech image for Buick while also making car shopping easier and more fun.</br></br>When people pop the software into a computer, the screen will light up with animated drawings of pistons and crankshafts chugging away and shock absorbers bouncing up and down. By pressing a few buttons, computer users can load the trunk with luggage and place stick-figure drawings of Mom, Dad, Junior and the family dog into the car's seats. Getting down to more serious business, they will be able to compare the standard equipment and mileage of a Buick with such competitive makes as Nissan and BMW, and calculate their monthly payments for different Buick models. "Our disk allows people to ask questions at their leisure without all the sales pressure of a dealer showroom," says Patrick Harrison, a Buick marketing manager.</br></br>Buick is on the inside track of a brand new advertising medium. As personal computers spread to more homes and offices, a growing number of direct marketers are putting their sales spiels on software which they believe will get lots more attention than yet another glossy catalog. "Most brochures end up in the garbage, but a computer diskette will at least arouse people's curiosity to take a look," says Jeff Einstein, president of Einstein Automation Solutions Inc., a New York company that puts ads on floppy disks.</br></br>SO FAR, floppy disks are being tested mainly by marketers of automobiles and financial services, including Chase Manhattan Bank, GM's Chevrolet division and Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln-Mercury division. Equitable Life Assurance Society is developing a disk for its insurance agents to hand out, and Merrill Lynch & Co. is considering disks as a new method for selling brokerage services. "Floppy disks reach only a small audience, but the people who work with computers are an excellent demographic target for us," says Mary Rudie, director of marketing services at Merrill Lynch. SoftAd Group, the Sausalito, Calif., firm that designed the Buick floppy disk, notes that about 75% of PC users are college graduates with a median household income of more than $45,000.</br></br>"Software certainly isn't the right medium for selling toothpaste," says Paula George, president of SoftAd. "But it would work for electronic equipment like VCRs and other expensive products that involve a complex selling message."
ONE of the most puzzling aspects of the economy is why enormous Federal deficitsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½nearly $40 billion for this fiscal year and $25.5 billion for nextï¿½ï¿½ï¿½are having so little effect in bringing about economic recovery.</br></br>It is even more mysterious than the ease with which President Nixon shifted from being a budget-balancer to historyï¿½Ûªs biggest deficit-spender. At least, one can find a political motivation for the Presidentï¿½Ûªs dramatic conversion.</br></br>The failure of deficit spending to have the intended stimulative effect requires closer analysis. What is becoming clear is that pumping a lot of expansionary power into peopleï¿½Ûªs hands by fiscal or monetary means can be disappointing if other considerations induce saving rather than spending.</br></br>Consumer buying is any- ï¿½Û¢ thing but enthusiastic, and there are now serious doubts that the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consensusï¿½Û forecast for a $100 billion growth in Gross National Product this year can be achieved.</br></br>Economic recovery on the business side has also been weak, despite all sorts of tax give-aways that were provided in the hope that businessmen would then borrow more, spend, and expand.
The U.S. economy grew at a hefty 5.5 percent annual rate in the July-September period, a remarkably rapid pace for an economic expansion only a few months shy of its ninth birthday, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.</br></br>"The U.S. economy remains in overdrive," said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "We expect the fourth-quarter gross domestic product to rise at about a 5 percent rate [and then] to moderate slightly to a 3.5 percent to 4 percent rate during 2000."</br></br>Last month, Commerce had estimated third-quarter economic growth at a somewhat slower but still strong 4.8 percent annual rate. It revised that estimate upward yesterday on the basis of more complete information about economic developments during the period.</br></br>Even with such rapid growth and an unemployment rate just above 4 percent, inflation remained extremely low during the summer.</br></br>Prices paid by consumers, businesses and governments for their purchases--regardless of whether the goods and services were produced in the United States or imported--rose at a 1.7 percent rate in the third quarter. Excluding the volatile prices of food and energy items, the increase was at only a 1.2 percent rate.
If the Federal Reserve hadn't arranged the sale of Bear Stearns and taken over responsibility for its most questionable securities, the company likely would have had only one avenue as it ran out of operating cash late last week: bankruptcy.</br></br>That bankruptcy would have been painful, sending new waves of distrust through the financial system and likely forcing Bear's counterparties to book reserves for losses. But even in a world of bad choices, there's always a worst choice. And the Fed, by being so quick to jettison the bankruptcy process, cut off a valuable source of new information to financial markets and blurred the critical distinction between sophisticated and unsophisticated investors.</br></br>True, a Bear bankruptcy would be a mess. To get an idea, pull up one of the Enron bankruptcy spreadsheets from six years ago: creditor after creditor listed on page after page, with amounts owed from a few hundred dollars to hundreds of millions each.</br></br>A Bear bankruptcy would also have caused shocks through the financial system. Institutional investors would have to rethink whether or not they trust the party on the other side of each of their trades, particularly in the opaque derivatives market. ("Is the company good for the money?") Hedge funds, and other personal and institutional clients, would have to worry about who has actual custody of their accounts.</br></br>And so, to avoid those shocks, the Fed has done something unprecedented. It has provided $30 billion in guarantees behind Bear's most complex, illiquid securities, so that the much larger and more secure J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. would be willing to buy the company for $2 a share.
Enrollment at private and parochial schools across Maryland will hold steady or increase slightly this year, although the recession has forced more families to apply for financial assistance, school officials say.</br></br>Enrollment figures for the 1991-92 academic year will not be compiled for several months. But private schools in Prince George's, Montgomery and Howard counties are likely to see their enrollments rise by 2 percent, the Association of Independent Maryland Schools predicted.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The schools are maintaining. Early statistics are balancing out to show virtually no change in enrollment," said Sara Donnelly, executive director of the association of 78 private schools.</br></br>Sacred Heart in Bethesda, enrollment is expected to be the same as last year, when the school added 115 students to its student body of 580. The schoolï¿½Ûªs tuition, which ranges from $6,800 to $7,075 a year, has not deterred returning or new students, officials said.</br></br>"I'm surprised at how neck and neck itï¿½Ûªs running, because we expected a decrease because of the economy and war,ï¿½Û said Sandra Du-binsky, director of admissions.
SINGAPORE -- There was bad news almost everywhere they looked yesterday but investors chose instead to focus on the bright side in Asia, pushing many regional stock markets to healthy gains amid hopes of a U.S. recovery in the new year.</br></br>Those gains came on a day when the ripples from the demise of energy giant Enron Corp. continued to spread, Japan saw its sovereign credit rating downgraded to the same level as Italy by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Argentina's troubles again raised the question of a contagion effect for emerging markets in Asia.</br></br>But it was evidence of renewed consumer spending in the U.S. that sent investors into the markets to buy technology stocks in places like Taiwan, where the local index rose 2.6% to a three-month high of 4766. A 2.9% rise in U.S. consumer spending in October, plus optimistic signs in construction spending data and a key purchasing managers' report, led some to see momentum building toward a U.S. recovery in the second quarter of next year.</br></br>Add the belief of many that Asian technology stocks have hit bottom and you have the elements for a sustained rally in regional markets, suggests Markus Rosgen, Asia strategist for ING Barings in Hong Kong.</br></br>"It's a real move up because there's a much higher likelihood of a recovery in the U.S. than there was three months ago," he said.
Doubts are growing that the Federal Reserve Boardï¿½Ûªs tight money policy, generally considered to date from last Dec. 6, has done what it was intended to do.</br></br>On that day the independentï¿½Ûª Fed raised its discount rate from 4Vï¿½ to 5 per cent and, more importantly, lifted the permissible ceiling on commercial banksï¿½Ûª time deposits from 4V2 to 5% per cent.</br></br>It did so in the face of public appeals from Treasury Secretary Henry H.

The spending and tax bills signed yesterday by President Reagan won't actually shrink the federal deficit from the 1987 level, budget experts say, but rather will only keep the deficit from widening significantly.</br></br>Moreover, some of the savings claimed in the legislationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½such as provisions that simply shift spending into the futureï¿½ï¿½ï¿½have minimal effects on the nationï¿½Ûªs long-run fiscal woes.</br></br>Genuine savings were also enacted, however, and the fact that the White House and Congress finally moved forward with their budget agreement will reduce the risk of disaster in financial markets, economists say. In addition, the outcome pleases America's trading partners, making them more likely to cooperate with the United States in keeping the world economy growing, according to administration officials.</br></br>That, in short, is the economic impact of the two pieces of budget and tax legislation that lawmakers spent the past eight days drafting and nearly all night Monday approving.</br></br>The first thing to understand about the measures, budget experts say, is that they donï¿½Ûªt cut the deficit, at least not in the way that most people think. Federal red ink totaled $148 billion in the 1987 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30. If the economy grows sluggishly next year, as many economists expect, the deficit will probably widen to between $160 billion and $170 billion in fiscal 1988, and further the year after, according to budget analysts in the administration, Congress and outside government.
Consumer growth stocks, flourishing in a sluggish economy, are leading the market to highs once again.</br></br>The high prices commanded by these growth stocks are reminiscent of the early 1970s, when investors paid seemingly outrageous prices for similar issues. Their demise produced one of the worst stock market declines in modern times, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling about 50% from its early 1973 high.</br></br>The accompanying chart shows some of the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the highest price/earnings ratios, based on trailing 12-month earnings. While growth stocks haven't yet reached the peak levels of December 1972, "we can see them at price levels that no one is anticipating now," says Joseph Barthel, a technical analyst with Butcher & Singer in Philadelphia.</br></br>The early '70s witnessed the rise and fall of "nifty 50" -- a group of companies that were prized by investors because they believed these concerns would grow consistently and predictably. The reign of the nifty 50 ended with the 1973 oil crisis and the bear market of 1974 because these companies didn't fare well in a high-inflation environment.</br></br>Like the nifty 50 of yesteryear, the charmers of today's market -- the stocks of drug, food, beverage, retailing and tobacco companies -- can see earnings grow despite weak economic activity and low inflation. And, these concerns generally benefit from the proposed tax overhaul.
HOT SPRINGS, Va., May 18ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns today broke with the Nixon administration on the issue of wage-price restraint by recommending a mild form of voluntary control to help curb persistent inflation.</br></br>Burns said that the administrationï¿½Ûªs exclusive reliance on monetary and fiscal measures to handle todayï¿½Ûªs inflationary problems could ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½increase greatly the risks of a very serious business recession.ï¿½Û</br></br>The Federal Reserve chairman came up with this unexpected recommendation in a major policy speech at the American Bankers Association 1 Monetary Conference, which opened here this morning.</br></br>President Nixon has repeatedly stated his opposition to engaging in direct pressures on management and labor to restrain price and wage ad-1 vances. This effort, sometimes called an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½incomes policy,ï¿½Û was again viewed with skepticism here today by Paul W.</br></br>George Romney, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, criticized the administrationï¿½Ûªs economic policies and said that exclusive reliance on fiscal-monetary policies is insufficient to curb inflation without intolerable increases in unemployment and losses in real output. He urged the administration to pay more attention to excessive wage and price increases.
Interest rates fell across the board yesterday as investors and traders registered growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut rates at its next policymaking session, July 5 and 6.</br></br>The market's expectation that the Fed will lower rates was indicated by yesterdayï¿½Ûªs drop in bond yieldsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the largest of which, seven-hundredths of a percentage point, was on five-year U.S. Treasury notes. Whatï¿½Ûªs more, yields on every type of Treasury security due in five years or less are now below the Fed's current 6 percent target for overnight rates.</br></br>That gapï¿½ï¿½ï¿½between market rates for Treasuries and the Fed funds rate ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is likely to be a powerful signal to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan that the market expects a cut.</br></br>Greenspan, who said recently that he does not expect the current period of slow economic growth to turn into a recession, could provide market participants with some clues about his thinking on rates in a speech tonight before the Economic Club of New York. Following the speech, which has been scheduled for several months, he will be questioned by Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman and Martin Davis, president of Wellspring Associates.</br></br>Fed governor Janet Yellen said yesterday in an interview that the market clearly is assuming the Fed will act to cut rates in the next month or two, but she would not say whether the market was right or wrong. The Fed raised short-term rates seven times in the 12 months ended in February, doubling them from 3 percent to 6 percent, in an effort to cool off an overheating economy and hold down inflation.
WASHINGTON -- A U.S. regulator said banks' trading revenue declined 16% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, the latest sign of a slowdown in a traditional Wall Street profit engine.</br></br>Bank holding companies reported trading revenue of $16.8 billion in the first quarter, down $3.3 billion from first quarter of 2013, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said in a quarterly report. This year's first-quarter revenue also was 23% less than the average for the same quarter over the previous five years, driven by lost revenue from equities as well as interest-rate and foreign-exchange products, the OCC said. In May, some big banks warned that a slump in trading revenue would deepen in the second quarter.</br></br>"The extended period of both low interest rates and low volatility has weakened client demand for risk management transactions," Kurt Wilhelm, director of the OCC's Financial Markets Group, said in a statement.</br></br>Overall, banks reduced their exposure to derivatives, but two institutions -- Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- reported increases in "value at risk," a measure of the maximum expected loss in a trading day.</br></br>Credit: By Ryan Tracy and James Sterngold

NEW YORK -- Even as corporate loan demand stays weak, banks are finding hefty profits from restructuring some buyouts of the 1980s.</br></br>Since last summer, the banks have collected more than $500 million in upfront fees by refinancing nearly $20 billion of loans on the balance sheets of debt-heavy companies. Another $90 million to $100 million in fees could come from the $6.2 billion Time Warner Inc. loan now in the bank syndication market, bankers say.</br></br>It's not a bad deal for the companies, which will end up with sharply lower interest payments and reduced debt levels through new loans, equity issuance and retirement of high-yield "junk" debt.</br></br>Banks come out ahead several ways. First, there's the upfront fees -- similar to points paid by home buyers -- that run as high as 3% of the loan's size. The fees, separate from the interest rates charged on the loan, are paid by companies, usually to several dozen American and foreign banks to obtain a commitment.</br></br>Longer term, the banks benefit from wider profit margins because they're not passing along the full reduction in their cost of funds as interest rates have declined. And these richer loan deals are less risky since many of the leveraged companies have stable operations and are selling stock to pay off some of their junk bond and bank debt burdens.
Retirement is like a long vacation in Vegas.</br></br>The goal is to enjoy these years to the fullest, but not so fully that you run out of money. It is a dicey endeavor, involving tricky issues of longevity and investment returns.</br></br>As you try to figure out how much you can spend once retired, take a cue from the accompanying tables, which were put together by T. Rowe Price Associates, the Baltimore mutual-fund company.</br></br>To use the tables, you have to decide how long your retirement might last, what stock-bond mix you will hold and what percentage of your portfolio's value you might withdraw in the first year of retirement. After the first year, you are assumed to step up the amount you withdraw, along with inflation.</br></br>The tables don't provide definitive answers. Instead, like a gambler, you have to play the percentages. The answer you pluck from the tables is the chance that you will make it through retirement, without running out of money.
Figuring that the small investor is the last to get wind of a major market swing, options strategists are tracking the public's trek into puts.</br></br>Aggressive retail trading in put options -- which give holders the right to sell a stock or the cash value of a stock index at a set price for a set time, in anticipation of declining prices -- is viewed as a contrary indicator. Heavy action by the public in put options suggests to professionals that the stock market has bottomed out and that a rally is at hand.</br></br>So far, the retail action in puts isn't shouting the return of a bull market.</br></br>"Essentially, it's close, but no cigar," says Steve Shobin, a market analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The public is kind of worn out, but hasn't given up entirely." Philip Roth, vice president of technical analysis at E.F. Hutton, adds: "The options indicators are disappointing if you're looking for a low in the market."</br></br>With the stock market twisting in the wind, overall put-option trading has been rising. Options trading on a moving 10-day average on the Chicago Board Options Exchange is running about eight puts to every 10 calls. During April, the ratio was 4 1/2 puts for every 10 calls. A call option is the right to buy a stock or the cash value of a stock index at a set price for a set time, in anticipation of rising prices. With index options, investors can speculate on the direction of the overall market rather than individual stocks.
The National Association of Securities Dealers is expected today to name longtime Wall Street executive and former U.S. energy director Frank G. Zarb as president and chief executive.</br></br>The appointment caps a longer-than-expected search for a leader of the NASD, during which several candidates declined to be considered for the high-profile but much-altered post.</br></br>Mr. Zarb, identified as the leading candidate for the post two weeks ago, succeeds Joseph R. Hardiman, who is retiring Friday after 10 years at the helm. The NASD is the parent of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the main market for small stocks, though also home for such big-capitalization stocks as Microsoft and Intel.</br></br>Late yesterday, the NASD board was expected to vote in favor of Mr. Zarb's appointment and announce the decision at today's board meeting at the Inn at Spanish Bay in Pebble Beach, Calif.</br></br>Mr. Zarb, 61 years old, is the departing chairman of Alexander & Alexander Services, an insurance-brokerage firm that is being acquired by Aon. He was formerly chairman at Travelers Group's Smith Barney Inc.; a vice chairman at Travelers; and was President Ford's energy director from 1974 to 1977.
The New York Stock Exchange, already facing pressure to modernize its trading operations, is about to get a major, fully electronic competitor.</br></br>The Archipelago trading system and the Pacific Exchange announced they are creating a new stock market. The alliance marks the first time one of the new alternative trading systems, known as ECNs, will effectively share a membership card as a traditional stock exchange.</br></br>By joining with the Pacific, Archipelago would instantly acquire the status necessary to compete with the NYSE on a level playing field.</br></br>Under the alliance, Archipelago Holdings LLC, which operates the Archipelago electronic communications network, will acquire the Pacific Exchange's struggling stock-trading business. In return, the Pacific Exchange, based in San Francisco, will become a minority shareholder in Archipelago and provide regulatory and exchange-management services to the new entity.</br></br>The plan is subject to regulatory approvals. Archipelago is one of the fast-growing screen-based trading systems that have grabbed almost a third of the Nasdaq Stock Market's volume. They have taken very little share of NYSE-listed volume, however, partly because they are technically brokers, and only stock exchanges have full access to the linkages between the venues that trade NYSE stocks.
Correction: A Sept. 24 A-section photo caption incorrectly identified Democratic Sen. Tim Johnson (S.D.) as a Republican. (Published 9/26/2008)</br></br>The Bush administration sent some of its most powerful figures to Capitol Hill yesterday to rally support for a $700 billion plan to revive the U.S. financial system, but they encountered stiff resistance from lawmakers who are deeply skeptical of the proposal and angered by the administration's push for its speedy approval.</br></br>Vice President Cheney, White House Chief of Staff Joshua B. Bolten and other Bush advisers shuttled from meeting to meeting, selling privately to worried lawmakers what Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pitched publicly at a Senate hearing: a massive bailout for the financial markets. They urged Congress to authorize the plan quickly and without many alterations.</br></br>The issue transcended party lines. Democrats voiced doubts, and many Republicans, particularly in the House, balked at the entreaties from Cheney, Bolten and other officials.</br></br>"Just because God created the world in seven days doesn't mean we have to pass this bill in seven days," Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) said after exiting a two-hour meeting with Cheney.
A large, unexpected drop in orders placed with manufacturers last month caused many economists to conclude yesterday that economic growth is slowing more than had been predicted and that the risk of a recession has increased.</br></br>While none of those economists said they are forecasting a recession, several said the Federal Reserve may need to begin cutting interest rates in the next few months to head one off.</br></br>"Will there be a recession? I still don't think so, but it will take Fed easing to avoid it," said Mickey Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank Corp. in New York.</br></br>The reevaluation of the economy was triggered by the Commerce Department's report that new orders for long-lasting items, such as cars, defense equipment, machinery and appliances, tumbled 4 percent last month. The decrease was the third consecutive monthly decline, the largest drop since December 1991 and far more than analysts had anticipated.</br></br>The report was "a bit of a shocker," said Ray Stone of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial markets research firm in Princeton, N.J. "Our view of the world has changed a little bit today as a result. The downside risk to the economy is greater" and the likelihood that the Fed will lower interest rates is greater, he said.
DETROIT -- U.S. auto makers, in a mood of caution, are planning to build fewer cars in this year's fourth quarter than in any last quarter since the recession-plagued final period of 1982.</br></br>While a shift toward van and light-truck production accounts for some of the drop in car assembly, the factory schedules nonetheless indicate that the economy's "soft landing" hasn't yet erased fears of a slump in Detroit. "The other side of a soft landing is a soft recovery," said Mary Ann Keller, an auto industry analyst with Furman Selz Mager Dietz & Birney in New York. "We haven't created the pent-up demand," necessary for a sales boom, she added.</br></br>The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.</br></br>The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.</br></br>Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years.
' Federal Reserve Board Governor Henry C. Wallich yesterday rejected t he view held by the monetarist school that strict adherence by the Fed to pre-announced money supply targets ?would lead to stabler and ultimately jower interest rates.ï¿½Û</br></br>' Federal Reserve Board Governor Henry C. Wallich yesterday rejected t he view held by the monetarist school that strict adherence by the Fed to pre-announced money supply targets ?would lead to stabler and ultimately jower interest rates.ï¿½Û ' In a speech in Bethesda to the Robert Morris Associates, Wallich said that it 'may seem plausible that interest rates in the long run would be lower under such tight control of monetary aggregates ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½than a procedure that accepts temporary over- and under-shoots.ï¿½Û</br></br>But in the short run, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Monetary restraint, however steady, cannot quickly bringdown inflation nor interest rates,ï¿½Û the Fed governor asserted. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The most plausible view is that the main impact of monetary restraint on prices occurs ivith a two-year lag.ï¿½Û 'ï¿½Û¢ The Federal Reserve has been widely criticized this year for permitting exceedingly wide fluctuations in both interest rates and in the monetary aggregates. Influential advisers to the incoming Reagan administration, including economists Milton Friedman and Murray Weidenhaum, have joined in the policy critique.</br></br>* In addition, there have been background comments implying that pressure would l>e brought to bear on the Fed to adhere more strictly to its announced monetary targets. The Fed has not commented directly on such suggestions, hut Wallichï¿½Ûªs comments clearly constituted his own rebuttal of that line of thinking.</br></br>He conceded that the ups and downs of both interest rates and the supply aggregates had been wide this year, but blamed ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the sad record of the monetary aggregatesï¿½Û on rapidly shifting demand for money and credit, combined with the imposition and then the removal of credit controls.
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES announced an accounting investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and, to the surprise of many stock traders, the market shrugged off the news.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes IBM, still rose 25.14 points, or 0.28%, to 8922.95 -- a gain that would have impressed no one on an ordinary day. But yesterday, it was taken as a sign of the market's resilience, reflecting how much market psychology has changed in the past year.</br></br>Last summer, that kind of news would have tanked the market, traders said. "IBM obviously was negative news and the market fought it off," said Todd Leone, head of listed trading at New York brokerage firm SG Cowen. "We have had a lot of other accounting scandals crush the market, but this time people said it was isolated at IBM."</br></br>Investors were buoyed by another cautiously optimistic comment on the economy from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, which fueled hopes that the Fed will hold interest rates down to push the economy ahead. Some analysts think the Fed will cut its target short-term interest rates at its policy meeting later this month and could buy back bonds in the open market to prevent bond yields from rising. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note jumped in price and its yield, which falls when the price rises, hit 3.333%, virtually back to the 45-year low of 3.326% set last month.</br></br>The Nasdaq Composite Index, which doesn't include IBM but includes most other tech stocks, pushed through the 1600 mark to its highest close in more than a year, rising 0.81%, or 12.81 points, to 1603.56. It is up 20% this year and up 26% since the market began its most recent run on March 11.

Last year was a year of record profits for Criimi Mae, a business whose name no poet will ever make a sonnet of. Everything was going fine and then it collapsed on the same heap as hedge-fund guru John Meriwether.</br></br>Criimi Mae managed a portfolio of commercial mortgages, buying half of all such securities underwritten by Wall Street. The strip malls, apartment buildings and supermarkets behind the mortgages did not all become delinquent. They're doing fine -- rents have held up, consumers continue to consume. The underwriters did not all flee to the Bahamas, leaving a wake of disorderly paperwork.</br></br>What dropped dead was demand for mortgage-backed securities. This is what a bank run looks like in a world where banks are no longer the most important lenders. Superficially everything seems fine in the economy, but beneath the surface there has been a sudden withdrawal of liquidity from various markets that you didn't even know existed.</br></br>This might seem a bad moment to be attacking the consumer credit industry. Yet the Justice Department last week filed an antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard. Let's see, the vital sectors of the economy now under assault include Microsoft, Intel, Cisco Systems and 30 or 40 industries subject to grand-jury investigation. In a world ravaged by deflation, where the uniform wail of CEOs is that "we have no power to raise prices," Justice believes now is a good time to go hunting cartels.</br></br>The latest complaint is the usual quizzical piece of work. The credit card business is wildly competitive, with every mail bringing come-ons for lower rates, bonus points and higher credit limits. Some 6,000 banks issue Visa and MasterCard in ferocious rivalry with each other.
WASHINGTON -- For 10 months, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has kept his hands off the interest-rate lever.</br></br>When the recovery sputtered just before last November's election, Mr. Greenspan refused to cut short-term interest rates despite pleas from seven of the 12 regional Fed banks. When an inflation scare spooked the bond market earlier this year, Mr. Greenspan didn't raise rates -- although he probably would have had there been one more bad month of inflation news.</br></br>After listening to Mr. Greenspan's recent testimony before Congress, financial markets concluded that the chairman's fingers may be getting itchy. But the markets may not have been listening carefully.</br></br>Mr. Greenspan isn't nearly as hard to understand as some people say. Yes, his sentences are convoluted. Take this one: "Patently, the overall economic effect of fiscal policy, especially when combined with the uncertainties of the forthcoming health-reform package, has imparted a number of unconventional unknowns to the economic outlook."</br></br>But his current message is clear: The short-term interest rates that the Fed controls, adjusted for inflation, are near zero. In a growing economy, that is too low. The Fed is going to raise short-term interest rates one of these days. He didn't say when. He probably doesn't know when. The Fed will move sooner if inflation raises its ugly head. It will move later if inflation behaves.
NEW YORK -- A plunge in stock prices helped lift Treasurys prices moderately. But traders said bond-market activity was muted as many people pared back trading positions well ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday in the U.S.</br></br>Late yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 face value, at 100 16/32. Its yield fell to 5.664% from 5.694% late Friday, as yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>Meanwhile, the 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 9/32 at 106 28/32 to yield 5.752%, down from 5.773% Friday.</br></br>There weren't any major economic indicators during the session, and that left the bond market to focus primarily on the weakness in stocks. The Nasdaq Composition Index plummeted 151.44 points to 2875.75, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 167.22 points to 10462.65.</br></br>When stock prices fall sharply, investors often move funds to the relative safety of government securities. Some of the gains yesterday in Treasurys reflected such shifts, although a portion of the market's movement stemmed only from anticipation that investors would move to bonds from stocks.
Investors pulled back ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, selling highflying technology names and other stocks in order to take profits.</br></br>The hot, tech-driven Nasdaq Composite Index broke its recent streak of records, falling 49.69 points, or 1.46%, to 3342.87. Amid continuing fears of inflation and rising interest rates, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 93.89, or 0.85%, to 10995.63, slipping below the 11000 level. The blue chips still are up almost 20% for 1999, and the Nasdaq composite is up more than 52%.</br></br>The declines hit almost every stock group except airline stocks, which benefited from plans for a fare increase. Bonds and the dollar were mixed.</br></br>"It was just a breather in technology after a remarkable string of new highs," noted Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber. But "the way some of the interest-rate sensitive indexes have been acting has given some people cause for concern," he said, adding, "You're heading into the last month of the year and performance has been fantastic. It could be sideways to down for a while here."</br></br>Interest-rate worries were reflected in bank stocks, which fell for a fifth straight trading day, and in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which now is down more than 15% from its June record.
The United Auto Workers joined ï¿½Û¢the Teamsters yesterday in giving qualified support to President Carterï¿½Ûªs anti-inflation program ns administration officials voiced satisfaction with initial business and labor cooperation.</br></br>But a third major union, the International Association of Machinists, indicated it will follow through on earlier threats to disregard the 7 percent wage guideline in negotiating new contracts.</br></br>The 950,000-member IAM will negotiate contracts for airline ground crews later this year. The Teamsters, with 2 million members, and the UAW, with 1 Vz million members, will dominate next yearï¿½Ûªs heavy round of contract bargaining.</br></br>Labor Secretary Ray Marshall, a principal architect of the wage-price guidelines program that Carter announced Tuesday night, told reporters he expected it would take .six to eight months before the inflation rate begins to taper off in response to the program.</br></br>The president's program calls for a 7 percent limit on wage increases and a less specific price standard to bring the overall inflation rate down from 8 percent to less than 6% percent nex$ year. Although it includes some government sanctions, the program is voluntary and thus heavily dependent on union and corporate cooperation.
President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.</br></br>That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable lives</br></br>Concern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.</br></br>Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.</br></br>This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did.
American Airlines' AMR Corp. parent and Southwest Airlines reported sharply increased profits for the second quarter, signaling a continuing rebound in the U.S. airline industry even as fuel prices remain high.</br></br>The results underscore how aggressive airlines have been at slashing costs and running more-efficient operations. AMR spent nearly 30% more on jet fuel than it did in the year-earlier quarter -- $1.71 billion compared with $1.35 billion -- but cost containment in other areas such as maintenance and wages still enabled it to report a profit five times that of a year earlier.</br></br>Fuel prices remain the wild card and threatens to damp progress if prices rise further. Fuel now represents more than 31% of AMR's expenses, compared with just 12% four years ago, and the airline has continued to revise its price estimates upward. In January, AMR estimated an average full-year fuel price of $1.95 a gallon, which it increased to $2.07 in April and $2.18 yesterday.</br></br>U.S. airlines are digging their way out of a long-running financial slump that resulted in more than $40 billion in net losses since 2001. This year, the industry's losses should narrow to no more than $2 billion, before turning a profit next year, according to the Air Transport Association, an industry group.</br></br>Continental Airlines, US Airways Group Inc., AirTran Airways parent AirTran Holdings Inc. and Alaska Air Group Inc.'s Alaska Airlines are all expected to report profits for the second quarter and full year, according to analyst estimates provided by Thomson Financial. JetBlue Airways and UAL Corp.'s United are pegged for second-quarter profits, too, though they are expected to post losses for the full year. Meanwhile, Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines -- both mired in bankruptcy-court proceedings -- are expected to stay in the red for the second quarter and year.
STOCK INDEXES finished the quarter with a whimper, but still turned in one of their strongest quarterly performances in years.</br></br>With a decline of 3.61 points, to 8985.44 yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average failed to return to the 9000 level. Yet its red-hot spring rally left the blue-chip index up 12% for the past three months and up 7.7% for the first half of the year. It was the first time the industrial average has finished a first half with a gain since 1999, the last year of the bull market that ended more than three years ago.</br></br>U.S. stock mutual funds jumped an average of more than 17% for the quarter, the strongest performance since the fourth quarter of 1999, according to preliminary numbers calculated by Lipper Inc. through Friday. (Lipper completes the final quarterly tally today.)</br></br>Some market analysts view the recent rally as a positive sign for those hoping the indexes can break a three-year streak of annual losses. But analysts also noted that stocks now seem to be drifting sideways after hitting a peak on June 17. For much of the spring, professional investors bought stocks in hopes that government stimulation would provoke an economic recovery. Now, increasingly, money managers are in a "show me" mode, looking for signs of the recovery.</br></br>Major companies are poised to begin announcing second-quarter results in about a week, at which time they also will be providing investors with readings on whether business conditions really are improving.

NEW YORK -- With inflation fears on the rise, investors may want to make sure their target-date funds' inflation-fighting strategies match their own.</br></br>Managers of these funds, typically funds of funds that are a popular tool for retirement planning, adopt varying strategies for protecting investors from inflation and differ on just how much protection is required.</br></br>"A lot of these firms are still sort of struggling with how to do it," says Josh Charlson, a senior mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. More are "adding some slice of TIPS," he says, referring to Treasury inflation-protected securities, a government bond designed to provide a return indexed to inflation.</br></br>Target-date funds automatically move toward more-conservative investments as an investor ages, known as the glide path. Some use inflation-fighting components only in longer-dated funds.</br></br>Since long-term inflation risk is low for younger investors, many longer-dated target-date funds hold significant stock positions and diversify globally, Mr. Charlson said. Inflation becomes more of a concern for investors nearing retirement, so short-dated funds often add TIPS -- usually not more than 10% of assets.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed a compromise bill that broadens the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to gather Wall Street information and for the first time sets guidelines for how the agency can curb forms of program trading.</br></br>The measure, passed by voice vote, is the first Senate-approved legislation to include provisions about program trading, in which computers help trade baskets of stocks and futures on those stocks. The bill, which is expected to breeze through the House in the next few days and be signed by President Bush, also gives the SEC the clout to close down the stock market in periods of extreme stress, provided the president doesn't oppose such a move. Currently only the president can order such a closure.</br></br>Much of the SEC-sponsored bill is direct fallout from the 1987 crash. The bill was first proposed by the SEC under Chairman David Ruder in 1988 but progressed slowly after being introduced in March 1989. It then was jump-started by the market drop in October 1989 and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s collapse earlier this year, and reflects reactions to those drops and the Drexel bankrupcty filing.</br></br>One section of the bill, for example, would allow the SEC to set up record-keeping procedures for large securities transactions. After the 1987 crash, the SEC complained that it didn't have sufficient information to determine risks to the overall financial system.</br></br>The bill also would allow the federal regulators to strengthen the clearance and settlement system for stocks, options and futures, again in an effort to reduce risks to the financial markets.
Stocks slipped as investors awaited a flood of economic news slated for this week.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 36.86 points, or 0.2%, to 15521.97. The S&P 500-stock index eased 6.32 points, or 0.4%, to 1685.33, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 14.02 points, or 0.4%, to 3599.14.</br></br>Even with Monday's losses, benchmarks held much of their July gains. The Dow industrials are up 4.1% for the month, and the S&P 500 has climbed 4.9%.</br></br>"We're at a point where we're [about] halfway through earnings reports, and the market is up strong, and we're moving into August, which is a time when there's not a lot of corporate news," said Andrew Slimmon, managing director with Morgan Stanley Global Investment Solutions, which manages $2.4 billion. "That means the market is in for a breather here."</br></br>While Monday's economic calendar was relatively light, traders are readying for a flurry of economic data this week, including second-quarter gross domestic product and the Federal Reserve's policy-setting committee statement, both due on Wednesday, as well as the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Friday.
A number of large companies are setting aside millions of dollars to protect pensions of top executives, even as they forgo contributions to financially strained pension plans for other workers.</br></br>The issue of inequity in pension plans is heating up in the airline industry, amid recent disclosures that AMR Corp., Delta Air Lines and UAL Corp. had poured millions into special pension trusts for executives. That angered workers who have seen their own pension plans ravaged by weak stock markets and low interest rates. At AMR's American Airlines, employee outrage over the issue is threatening delicate labor talks that are crucial to keeping the company from filing for bankruptcy protection.</br></br>Some other companies that also have established such pension trusts for executives include Motorola Inc., Owens-Illinois Inc., TXU Corp., Altria Group Inc. (formerly Philip Morris), and Abbott Laboratories, according to regulatory filings.</br></br>Companies that contribute to pensions for executives -- while choosing not to fund regular pensions -- aren't breaking any laws. Federal rules require companies to make minimum contributions if their pension plans become excessively underfunded. That occurs when liabilities exceed assets by too great a margin as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. But companies can coast for years with pensions that have just two-thirds or three-quarters of the money they would need to pay their future obligations.</br></br>The practice illustrates the growing gap in retirement security between most employees and those at the very top. As senior executives rely more on their special pensions, they have less incentive to ensure that the regular pension plan offers adequate benefits -- or is adequately funded. Executives' special pensions also are increasingly being sheltered from their companies' financial troubles, including bankruptcy.
Technology stocks lifted the market today as strong earnings reports by chipmaker Intel and other key companies eased worries about sluggishness in the computer industry. Indexes of smaller companies, heavily weighted with technology stocks, set new records.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.10 points to 5620.02, skipping back above the 5600-mark again. In just four sessions, the barometer of big U.S. companies has erased two-thirds of its recent 200-point slide, which was caused by interest rate and inflation worries.</br></br>Broader-market indicators made gains too, with the Nasdaq composite index rising 14.48 to 1124.92, a record close, as investors reacted to Intel's better-than-expected results for the first quarter. The Nasdaq's previous high of 1118.10 was reached April 4.</br></br>Calling demand for personal computers solid, Intel also issued a modestly upbeat outlook for the current quarter. The enthusiasm generated by Intel's report was compounded by similarly strong showing in Sun Microsystems' latest earnings statement, also released after the markets closed Monday.</br></br>In active Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Intel rose 4 5/16 to 64 7/8 and Sun Microsystems climbed 4 7/16 to 50 3/4. Cisco Systems rose 1 13/16 to 46 1/8. The enthusiasm for technology issues spilled over to the NYSE, where Motorola advanced 1 1/8 to 58 1/8, Compaq Computer rose 3/4 to 40 1/2 and IBM, a Dow component, gained 1 3/8 to 115 1/2.
Our economic policies are often promoted like a new car or deodorant: that is, they are oversold. So it is with the latest economic fad-greater saving. We're spendthrifts. We need to save more. George Bush says so. The Democrats say so. Gosh, Americans hardly save anything. In 1989, the personal savings rate amounted to a meager 5.5 percent of disposable income.</br></br>Now for the less startling truth. Of course, all prosperous nations must save and invest for the future. And Americans do. Indeed, the private savings and investment rates have been remarkably stable since the late 19th century. Even if government could easily induce Americans to save more-and that's not clear-higher living standards and faster economic growth wouldn't quickly result.</br></br>The great savings debate is mostly a political charade. President Bush and congressional Democrats are proposing separate plans to promote savings. Everyone wants to be seen as spurring the economy. The idea is to create a respectable pretext for enacting new tax relief for the middle class. If there's a savings "problem," then tax "incentives" to cure it are justified. The trouble is that the new tax-free savings accounts would almost certainly end up reducing national savings.</br></br>Saving means putting off consuming today to invest in something that will enrich us tomorrow. The logic works for both nations and individuals, and our collective individual savings provide the funds for the nation's investments. But three myths mar the savings debate. Consider them.</br></br>Wrong. Between 1980 and 1988, the private savings rate averaged 16.7 percent of gross national product, down negligibly from the 16.8 percent average between 1950 and 1979. The main motive for distorting this trend is political. It is to create a "problem" that then must be "solved." The most common misrepresentation is to cite the personal savings rate-savings by individuals-which dropped from an average of 8 percent of disposable income in the 1970s to 5.4 percent in the 1980s.
The U.S. dollar retreated yesterday as traders took profits from Wednesday's rally and speculated that interest-rate cuts by the West German, French and Dutch central banks will be followed by similar cuts today by the Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.</br></br>In anticipation of the West German Bundesbank's cut in its discount rate, or lending fee to financial institutions, to 3.5% from 4%, traders drove the dollar to 2.2715 West German marks in early European trading. Lower interest rates abroad would make dollar-denominated investments more attractive, increasing demand for the U.S. currency.</br></br>But by late New York trading, the U.S. currency had fallen back to 2.2413 marks, down from 2.2688 the day before, as profit-taking and expectations of Fed action dominated the market.</br></br>The dollar dropped to 179.50 Japanese yen from 180.93, and fell to 1.8930 Swiss francs from 1.9140. The British pound fell to $1.4408 from $1.4535.</br></br>In early trading in Tokyo Friday, the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 179.55 yen from 179.50 in New York yesterday afternoon.
GERBER AGREED to be acquired by Swiss drug giant Sandoz for $3.7 billion, or $53 a share, a hefty premium apparently intended to thwart rival bids. Gerber, which dominates the U.S. baby-food market, quietly searched for months for a buyer or joint-venture partner. The deal gives Gerber the global sales, marketing and distribution network it has found elusive, while allowing Sandoz to sharply expand its food business. Gerber's stock rose 45% to $50.125.</br></br>The Gerber transaction lacks a lockup agreement, a provision to ward off competing bids that has been absent from big acquisitions after a judge all but invalidated such accords in Paramount's suit against QVC.</br></br>---</br></br>Flagstar agreed to pay about $54 million to settle the bulk of the litigation regarding race-bias charges against its Denny's restaurant chain, people familiar with the cases said.</br></br>---
Yahoo Inc. said first-quarter net income more than doubled on robust growth in online advertising, international operations and its fee- based businesses.</br></br>Yahoo also raised revenue projections for 2005.</br></br>The Sunnyvale, Calif., Internet company said net income rose to $205 million, or 14 cents a share, from $101 million, or seven cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding sales of investments and other factors, profit would have been $190 million, or 13 cents a share. That exceeded the earnings of 11 cents a share expected by analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</br></br>Revenue rose 55% to $1.17 billion. Excluding commissions paid to marketing partners, Yahoo had revenue of $821 million, well above its projection of $765 million to $805 million. Yahoo raised its 2005 revenue projection on that basis to $3.57 billion to $3.72 billion, from $3.37 billion to $3.57 billion.</br></br>Chairman and Chief Executive Terry Semel told analysts the company "achieved balanced growth with contributions across the board from our multiple lines of business and geographic regions." He said in an interview that individuals on average spent more time using Yahoo, which helped boost the company's ad revenue.
Author: Kana Inagaki</br></br>TOKYO--The dollar could fall to a record low against the yen this year if a gradual economic recovery in the U.S. runs out of steam or inflation concerns spread from emerging economies to still-fragile regions such as Europe, a fund manager at a unit of Asia's second-largest hedge fund said Thursday.</br></br>"The main scenario remains that the U.S. economy will further expand ahead of next year's presidential election," Fumihito Akiyama, a fund manager at the asset-management unit of Sparx Group Co., a Japanese hedge fund with $8.1 billion in assets, said in an interview.</br></br>But Mr. Akiyama said investors must acknowledge the risk of a sharp fall in the dollar in the event of a surprise deterioration in U.S. macroeconomic data or a third round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve--possibilities ruled out by many in the market.</br></br>He added that safe-haven flows into the yen could push the dollar below its record low of 79.75 yen against the Japanese currency in 2011 if inflation fears spread from rapidly growing emerging countries to other parts of the global economy.

U.S. Treasury prices trickled lower Thursday as nervousness about when the Federal Reserve might raise rates settled down a bit.</br></br>After suffering a sharp selloff Wednesday on the back of the Fed's policy announcement, Treasurys wobbled between minor gains and losses most of the session. The ten-year note traded down 1/32 in price by late afternoon to yield 2.775%, according to Tradeweb. The 30-year slipped 8/32 to yield 3.665%, while the two-year held flat to yield 0.428%. Bond yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The session's ups and downs reflected buying from bargain hunters who took advantage of Wednesday's sharp price drop, offset by sellers facing the newfound fear of a potential Fed rate increase on the horizon.</br></br>"There's been a shift in the Fed's thinking," said Tom di Galoma, head of fixed income rates at ED&F Man Capital. "They're beginning to say we have to address raising rates."</br></br>The Fed's policy update Wednesday rattled bond investors after the committee's rate projections showed some officials shifting forward their forecast for higher rates. Comments from Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen exacerbated those concerns after she said a rate increase could happen around six months after the central bank is done buying bonds.
QDEAR BOB: I have a FICO score of 750 and wonder why I am still paying private mortgage insurance. -- Jennifer R.</br></br>When you bought your house or condo, you probably paid little or no cash down. Because of your high credit score, your lender approved a high loan-to-value ratio mortgage. The lender insisted on PMI to eliminate its foreclosure loss risk.</br></br>Until you have at least 20 percent equity, your lender still views you as a high risk, which requires PMI to protect the lender.</br></br>Also, until your home loan has at least 24 months of on-time monthly payments, most mortgage lenders will refuse to cancel PMI. Some especially nasty lenders will not cancel PMI until the loan balance declines below 80 percent of its original balance, ignoring your home improvements and market value appreciation.</br></br>That usually takes 10 to 15 years, depending on your interest rate. If you have one of these really bad lenders, refinance with a different lender.
NEW YORK -- Financial issues took center stage as the stock market posted a broad-based advance that resulted in yet another series of records.</br></br>Expectations that interest rates would continue to fall in the aftermath of Friday's weak report on May employment led to brisk activity among financial stocks, which have lagged the market through much of the year.</br></br>The broad market showed little direction through midafternoon, when the buying interest in the financial sector and futures-related buy programs combined to ignite a rally that broke the Dow Jones Industrial Average from a trading range on either side of 2900.</br></br>The average, which finished last week just above that level, posted its fourth record close in the past five sessions and its 10th since May 14 by surging 34.22 to 2935.19.</br></br>At the same time, the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index became the latest market measure to establish a record by rallying 2.18 to 200.21. The prior high was 199.34, set last Oct. 9.
The U.S. Census Bureau reported yesterday that the South, traditionally the Iowest-income section of the country, climbed past the Midwest in average after-tax household income in 1984.</br></br>In the nation as a whole, the bureau found that the average U.S. household had after-tax income of $21,564 in 1984 after paying $6,400 in federal and state income taxes, Social Security taxes and property taxes. That figure was 2.7 percent greater than in 1983 after adjusting for inflation.</br></br>The figures showed that after-fax household income was highest in the West ($23,038), second in the Northeast ($22,001), followed by the South ($20,951), with the Midwest last ($20,865).</br></br>In 1980, when the bureau began calculating after-tax household income, it computed the figures for 1974 as well, and found that the South was $2,100 below the Midwestï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not surprising because the South, with little manufacturing and a traditional low-income rural economy, had long been viewed as the poorest section.</br></br>By then, however, the Southï¿½Ûªs economy had started growing: meanwhile, the Midwest has been hit with a series of economic problems resulting from a weakening of heavy manufacturing industries. <
Activity in the eurozone's private sector picked up only modestly in December, according to surveys of purchasing managers, an indication that the currency area's economy is ending the year on a weak footing.</br></br>The surveys also found that businesses again cut their prices in the face of weak demand, a development that will concern the European Central Bank, which is struggling to raise the currency area's inflation rate from the very low level it has settled at for more than a year.</br></br>Data firm Markit on Tuesday said its composite purchasing managers index--a measure of activity in the manufacturing and services sectors in the currency bloc--rose to 51.7 in December from 51.1 in November. A reading below 50.0 indicates activity is declining, while a reading above that level indicates it is increasing.</br></br>Preliminary results from Markit's survey of 5,000 manufacturers and service providers also showed that a significant pickup in activity is unlikely in the coming months, with new orders up only marginally following November's decline.</br></br>The surveys also found that businesses continued to cut their prices, although at a slightly less aggressive pace.
Author: Tara Loader Wilkinson</br></br>Didier Duret, chief investment officer at ABN Amro Private Banking, tells The Wall Street Journal why he likes high-yield bonds and quality enhancement.</br></br>WSJ: What are your top picks at the moment?</br></br>Mr. Duret: Historically low interest rates maintained by central bank policies create a strong incentive for investors to actively seek risk and yield, albeit cautiously and through diversification. Therefore, low-grade corporate and high-yield bonds should be considered, along with equities generating strong dividends, especially those in or with exposure to emerging markets.</br></br>WSJ: What makes low-grade corporate and high-yield bonds a good investment?
Real-estate prices increased for the fourth consecutive month, but consumers are feeling more glum, a disconnect that shows how rising unemployment continues to weigh on households even as the economy improves.</br></br>The S&P/Case-Shiller home price composite 20-city index rose 1.2% in August from July, with help from lower mortgage rates and a push from the $8,000 federal first-time home-buyer tax credit that expires next month. The 20-city index is down 11.3% from a year ago.</br></br>Separately, the Conference Board on Tuesday reported that its gauge of consumer confidence fell to 47.7 in October, the second fall in two months. The present-situation index fell to 20.7, the lowest since February 1983, largely on consumers' downbeat assessment of the labor market.</br></br>High unemployment has made the Conference Board's index generally more negative than the Reuters/University of Michigan gauge of consumer sentiment, said Anthony Crescenzi, a portfolio manager and strategist at Pimco, a money-management firm in Newport Beach, Calif.</br></br>The housing report showed a real-estate market that is slowly improving but is still a long way from healthy. In 17 of 20 cities, the not-seasonally adjusted price index was higher in August than in July. Affordability has improved, providing an opportunity for some households that were priced out of the market as well as for cash-toting investors. Home prices have returned to 2003 levels, according to Standard & Poor's.
Some optimistic experts are now saying that though this will be a turbulent year for global markets, the worst of the financial crisis is now behind us. Would it were so. We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.</br></br>We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.</br></br>Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global "stag-deflation": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.</br></br>Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.</br></br>The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years. During the 1980s, the U.S. also faced the burdens of twin deficits, but relied on financing from key strategic partners like Japan and Germany. This time, the situation is more worrisome because today's financing comes not from U.S. allies, but from strategic rivals like Russia, China and a number of relatively unstable petrostates. This leaves the U.S. perilously dependent on the kindness of strangers.
The Government took a second major step yesterday to ease nondefense construction controls and curb growing unemployment in the building industry.</br></br>Commercial buildings and public works structures less than 20 percent completedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ frozen since last Octoberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½will be permitted to obtain enough steel to proceed with the projects beginning April.</br></br>Effect of this' order by the National Production Authority will be to bring some relief to New York, Washington, and other cities which have been hard hit by the stringent construction controls for the lack of military and defense projects. Over-all Construction Down</br></br>Last week NPA announced it will authorize, beginning July* 1, the construction of 645 community . buildings, churches, police stations, jails, and public institutions.</br></br>The newest order does not remove the building ban on construction projects which have not reached the foundation stage; nor does it bring any easing of the prohibitions, against building for recreational or amusement purposes.
; MOSCOW, Oct. 30ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Soviet ;finance minister proposed sharp tax ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½increases today on several nonessen-itial food items, including tobacco and ;beer, to reduce a growing budget ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½deficit.</br></br>; Addressing the Supreme Soviet legislature, Finance Minister Valen-itin Pavlov said that the price rises ;were necessary to prevent rationing ï¿½Û¢by scarcity. But his proposals caused ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½so much grumbling among deputies that President Mikhail Gorbachev ;wa3 forced to call for order.</br></br>: The governmentï¿½Ûªs plan envisages ;a 30 percent rise in the price of tobacco, one of the steepest price rises Iseen here since Gorbachev came to ipower in 1985. The Communist authorities have postponed major price -reforms until at least 1991 for fear that increases in the prices of essen-</br></br>Over the last few weeks, Soviet economists have suggested that the country is headed for economic collapse unless measures are taken soon to strengthen labor discipline and balance the budget. But, while everybody agrees that further economic sacrifices are necessary, the government has not come up with an accepted a plan.</br></br>Soviet newspapers last weekend published grim economic statistics for the first nine months of 1989, showing that many branches of industry have failed to meet planned targets. The statistics showed that the gross national product had increased by 3.6 percent, instead of the planned 7 percent.
NEW YORK -- Major bank stocks are down 10% since August because of the rising interest rates that skewered the bond market last year. So are they bargains now, if rates are leveling off?</br></br>Some investors think so, but not analyst Lawrence Vitale of Bear Stearns. In fact, in an opinion that goes against accepted wisdom in some corners of Wall Street, Mr. Vitale yesterday morning sent the firm's clients a clear, startling message:</br></br>This is "Bank Hell," he declared.</br></br>Intensified competition and continued rate increases will pummel the banks throughout 1995, Mr. Vitale warned. "We believe that we are in a bear market for bank stocks, despite the continued strong industry fundamentals," he said in his commentary (which actually is a summary of a report issued just before the holidays that got little attention on Wall Street).</br></br>Even though bank stocks have declined to more-tempting levels, the Bear Stearns analyst added, "we believe there is further downside potential as earnings weakness in 1995 becomes more visible."
Sometimes provocative people become that way because they were provoked. Sharron Angle, 60, could be enjoying the 10 grandchildren she loves even more than her .44 magnum. Instead, she is the Republican nominee against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's quest for a fifth term as senator. Her campaign began, in a sense, three decades ago, when a judge annoyed her.</br></br>When her son was depressed about having to repeat kindergarten -- "He was a 6-year-old dropout" -- she decided on home schooling, which Nevada law permitted. But a judge construed the law to require that parents who home-school must live at least 50 miles from a public school.</br></br>She and many kindred spirits descended on Carson City to get the Legislature to correct this. One legislator, irritated by such grass-roots impertinence, said, "If I'd known there would be 500 people here instead of 50 and it would take five hours instead of 30 minutes, I would have thrown it [the legislation] in my drawer, and it would never have seen the light of day." Angle asked a cowboy standing next to her, "Can he do that?" The cowboy said yep. She has been politically incandescent ever since.</br></br>Even when asked where she was born, she is on message: "I was conceived in Lovelock [Nevada] but -- if you're not pro-life -- I was born in Klamath Falls [Oregon]." During her four terms in Nevada's 42-seat Assembly, many votes were "41-to-Angle." She wears as a badge of honor having been voted Nevada's worst legislator, a disparagement she says is always bestowed on a conservative because the voters are members of the press and the political class (the legislators and their staff).</br></br>Her favorite legislators? U.S. Sens. Jim DeMint and Tom Coburn and Minnesota congresswoman Michele Bachmann. They are coming here to help her. She says she will be 73 at the end of two Senate terms, but notes that her 103-year-old aunt lives in Arizona with her two sons, both in their 80s.
Secretary of Education William J. Bennett yesterday called for major changes in the nationï¿½Ûªs student financial aid programs, proposing that the federal government no longer subsidize interest rates on many student loans and that loan repayment schedules be based on a student's income after leaving school.</br></br>In announcing his proposals, Bennett sharply attacked colleges and universities for allowing a 150 percent increase in the average cost of a college education since 1975.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The heart of the matter is that colleges raise costs because they can raise costs,ï¿½Û said Bennett in a speech at Catholic University. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This cannot go on. The system must change.ï¿½Û</br></br>In laying out his ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½blueprintï¿½Û for the future of financial aid, Bennett proposed the expansion of a recently approved pilot program of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½income contingent loans,ï¿½Û in which students must pay the full interest rate on a loan instead of having the federal government pick up the costs of interest that exceed a preset ceiling. Under the pilot program, however, the repayment schedule is adjusted according to the borrowerï¿½Ûªs ability to pay.</br></br>Education Department officials said the program, if expanded, could eventually save billions of dollars in subsidies and loan defaults. They predicted that the default rate would decrease because payments would be held to no more than 15 percent of the borrowerï¿½Ûªs income.
When Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady unveiled a new U.S. strategy in March 1989 to reduce some of the huge debt Third World nations owed to commercial banks, his aides listed 39 nations that might be eligible for help.</br></br>Brady's was a revolutionary idea, compared with the idea that had preceded it. Brady contemplated actual debt relief or forgiveness, financed by about $30 billion put up by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Japan.</br></br>The old strategy, the Baker Plan, called for new loans on top of the old ones. That practice simply helped debtor nations pay off interest obligations, while preserving the fiction that the banks' loans were still productive. Write-offs force the banks to acknowledge real losses.</br></br>Nineteen months after the inception of the Brady Plan, however, the great majority of poor countries are still overwhelmed by massive commercial debt, their economies laid to waste by high unemployment and negative per-capita growth induced by failure to control their exploding populations. The biggest single act on the debt-relief front was a diplomatic gesture arising out of the Persian Gulf crisis: American forgiveness of $7 billion owed by Egypt (which wasn't being paid anyway).</br></br>The Brady Plan, at $30 billion, is under-funded. But in today's capital-short global economy, it's hard to believe that additional funds for debt relief can be found. Meanwhile, the flow of regular loans has been reduced to a trickle, in part because the borrowing countries have largely quit making payments to the banks-and because some banks, especially in America, are going through hard times.
An off-duty, black D.C. police officer arrived at his home in Prince George's County to find signs of a burglary. Moving from room to room in the twilight, he began searching for an intruder. Suddenly, from outside in the yard, a white Prince George's County policeman yelled, "Freeze!" Inside, the black policeman spun and lowered his hands as if to fire a gun. The county policeman fired through an open window and the bullet hit the black man in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.</br></br>The shot, fired at 6:40 p.m. on Dec. 14, 1987, echoed throughout Prince George's, a county with a bitter history of accusations of police brutality against blacks. Alex Williams was on his way home when the phone rang in his car. As he listened to an aide recount the details, he began to squint his eyes and tighten his lips. "All these emotions came over me," he remembers. " `Oh, my goodness,' I thought. `I've got to deal with this' . . . The black community was up in arms. The rest of the community was watching to see how I was going to handle this . . . It was a lot on me."</br></br>In a county that has seen its black population triple in less than two decades, the case became a test of Alex Williams' political strategy. Williams, the first black chief prosecutor in the 300-year history of Prince George's County, had won election by appealing to black and white voters. Could he continue to get support from both groups in such a racially explosive atmosphere no matter how impartial he was?</br></br>Blacks demanded an indictment. The county police department investigated and exonerated the officer. Amid cries of "whitewash," Williams decided to conduct his own probe and appointed an independent investigator. The slain man's family tried to bypass local officials altogether, calling for an inquiry by state authorities.</br></br>In the end, four long months after the slaying, Williams declared it an accident. "We conducted a thorough special investigation and came up with the facts," Williams said. "We looked at every aspect, met with the family, with all the witnesses, did an autopsy and put it to the grand jury. On the surface it looked clearly racial, but as we got into it, it clearly was not racial. It wasn't a black and white thing . . . We can justify everything we did and our decision not to charge the officer. There is no justification for criticism."
KIEV, Ukraine, Feb. 22ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Ukrainian government acknowledged today that it has sharply stepped up financial support to unprofitable state-run farms and factories, a move that could trigger higher inflation and jeopardize Western loans urgently needed to shore up the countryï¿½Ûªs crumbling economy.</br></br>Economics Minister Roman Shpek tord reporters here today that 24 trillion Ukrainian karbovanets (about $666 million) had been allotted as credits to state agriculture and industry in the first two months of this year. Although relatively small by U.S. standards, the amount is equivalent to half of all the money circulating in Ukraine, according to figures given by Shpek and supported by Western analysts here.</br></br>Ukraine has been negotiating with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank for $1.5 billion in loans since last month, when President Leonid Kravchuk signed a landmark accord in which he agreed to begin dismantling Ukraine's inherited Soviet nuclear weapons in return for U.S. and Russian security guarantees and Western financial aid.</br></br>As part of the negotiations, however, the Kiev government was asked to take measures to hold down inflationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½now running at about 60 percent a monthï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and to speed its transition from a Soviet-style command economy to a free-market system. "One of the things they were specifically told not to do was to give out credits" to failing government enterprises, said one Western diplomat. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yet they have done it." fully to persuade the Kiev leadership to press forward with meaningful economic reform, and many fear that a failure to do so could bring about uncontrollable social and political instability here. Indeed, a recent U.S. intelligence assessment noted in grim terms that continued economic decline in Ukraine, coupled with competing regional interests, could lead to civil strife and the fragmentation of Ukraine into two or three separate states.</br></br>One senior Western economist said that the Kiev government announcement, which coincides with a visit here by an IMF-World Bank negotiating team, would "at the very least delay" conclusion of the loan deal and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½instill doubts about Ukraineï¿½Ûªs ability to implement reform.ï¿½Û
Harold B. jporsey, Wall Street analyst, reviews the decline of the past seven v/eeks in the stock market . and points out that prices are still ipo per cent higher than three years ago; Page D*18.</br></br>The stock market closed on Friday at a price level which is just about 100 per cent higher than it was three years ago when it started an upward trend that was not subject to any serious interruptions. The latest price level is about 80 per cent higher than the famous 1929 peak. Incidentally, the market has declined about 7 to 10 per cent (depending on which stock price average you look at) from the all-time peak which was registered about seven weeks ago.</br></br>This seems to be one of those times when the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½incidentalï¿½Û is attracting much more attention than the long-term perspective. Stock price declines of as much as 10 per i cent are not especially unusual, and when the setbacks are limited to that proportion there usually is no adverse psychological effect upon the individuals or the businessmanï¿½Ûªs propensity to spend.</br></br>But each time a stock market decline approaches 10 per cent within a brief period, there tends to be a mounting concern about the possibility that the current weakness might be the move that will develop into something more serious. And that seems to describe the state of mind of business analysts and investment managers at this juncture.</br></br>Last week I had occasion to visit with numerous investment managers in traditionally conservative Boston and I found a considerably greater degree of skepticism about common stock investments in that quarter than seems to be present in either - New York or Washington.
Taped to the side of Jose Gabriel Gonzalez's snack cart is a handwritten note asking, "WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE CANAL NOW?" The question testifies to his anxiety about what will happen after Dec. 31, when the United States pulls out the last of its troops and the Panama Canal comes under full Panamanian control.</br></br>"I have great worries," said Gonzalez, whose cart occupies a busy street corner here. "I have lost my sense of security. I have never known Panama without the Americans being here."</br></br>Judging from numerous interviews, many Panamanians share his concern about the departure of the Americans, whose presence in Panama dates to its creation in 1903 after it broke from Colombia. In particular, they fear that entrenched political corruption and incompetence in the government will affect the administration and financial stability of the canal, which links the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They also worry about the economic costs of the U.S. troop pullout as well as potential harm to the investment climate.</br></br>Such reservations are not without irony. The treaties that set the stage for the canal handover and troop withdrawal were negotiated by Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar Torrijos, and President Jimmy Carter and approved overwhelmingly by Panamanian voters in 1977. The signing of the accords was seen as a powerful assertion of national sovereignty and catapulted Torrijos to the status of national hero.</br></br>In recent years, however, newspaper polls have indicated that between 50 and 70 percent of Panamanians queried support a continued U.S. military presence beyond 2000, particularly when the issue is framed in economic terms. About 36 percent of Panama's 2.8 million people live in poverty, and unemployment hovers near 13 percent. Some polls have even found that a majority of Panamanians would like the United States to retain control of the 50-mile-long canal, or, at least, operate it in partnership with Panama similar to the current arrangement.
NEW YORKï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The way the stock market started 1978, the portents seem to be for another disasterous year for investors after the 17 per cent slide in the Dow Jones industrial average last year in what some have dubbed the Carter market.</br></br>But many analysts remain hopeful that the current bear market could bottom sometime in the first half of 1978, perhaps sooner rather than later given the initial sleep slide, and that there then will be a rebound that will provide investors with some good profit-making opportunities.</br></br>The old Wall Street adage is that you don't make money buying after the market has gone up, only after it has gone down.</br></br>But projections for any major rally from the bottom are subdued because of the many uncertainties overhanging the investment outlook.</br></br>In the first five trading days of 1978, the market plunged 47 points and decisively broke ihrough the psychological 1300 barrier on the Dow which in the recent past had provided solid resistance. The Dow reached lows that have not been seen since the depths of the New York Cilv fiscal crisis in late 1975.
The bond market took a dive last week after several Federal Reserve policymakers were reported as hinting that the economy is growing so strongly that short-term interest rates ought to be raised soon.</br></br>Senior analysts at several major Wall Street firms advised their traders that the uniformity of views in the reports was so striking that the statements undoubtedly were the result of a coordinated effort. Central bank officials were signaling financial markets that higher rates were on the way, the analysts said.</br></br>There may be some flaws in that analysis: Several of the policymakers disavowed what they were reported to have said and they added that their statements were not coordinated.</br></br>In interviews, several Fed officials said they expect economic growth to slow to a sustainable pace of around 2 percent in the second half of this year, with the risks about evenly balanced that growth will be somewhat higher or somewhat lower than that. That view hardly suggests a stampede to raise rates, particularly given the current inflation picture.</br></br>The chart at the right shows how the Fed has slowed real economic growth to keep inflation low and also suggests that there is relatively little inflationary momentum that would require urgent Fed attention.
The Washington area's economy has been swimming upstream for many months against the currents of higher interest rates, a volatile stock market and rising fuel prices.</br></br>But so far the region's economy has kept its head up, with the latest jobs reports showing only small increases in unemployment and a slight drop in employment growth.</br></br>August's unemployment rate for the metropolitan area was a low 2.3 percent, just a notch higher than the 2.2 percent average for the three preceding months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</br></br>The bureau's August survey of employers also shows virtually no change in job growth in the region. Employment increased at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the Washington area between August 1999 and this past August. The growth rate from July 1999 to this past July was 2.7 percent.</br></br>The District's jobless rate moved up to 5.4 percent in August, from 5 percent in July, after allowing for seasonal employment changes. Despite the increase, the District's unemployment rate is still far lower than its average during the 1990s. Virginia's unemployment rate was 2.5 percent in August, unchanged from the month before, while Maryland's jobless number climbed to 3.5 percent in August from 3.2 percent in the previous month.
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Clark's restaurant at lunch time is filled from one richly paneled wall to the other with diamond-bedecked women and men sipping select wines -- hardly the scene to expect in a country that has teetered on the brink of default for the past six months.</br></br>"Our customers come here to be seen," says the silver-haired maitre d'. "The foreign debt doesn't matter to them."</br></br>The maitre d' may be overstating the case, but his fellow countrymen do seem singularly uninterested in the international flap over how Argentina is going to pay its $45 billion foreign debt. Up north, bankers and U.S. officials are tearing their hair over failed International Monetary Fund agreements and overdue interest charges. But down here, concern over the country's financial follies runs a poor second to everyday events in this elegant capital.</br></br>Argentina just doesn't look like a place in hock for billions of dollars. Women window-shop along the broad avenues, wrapped in furs to ward off the South American winter. The stores are stuffed with fine leather goods, designer fashions, glistening silver. Aerobics centers have waiting lists.</br></br>In an exclusive leather shop on Florida Street, a young man is buying two wallets -- very chic, very expensive. His explanation for all the high living in the midst of a huge debt crisis? "I don't feel the foreign debt, I feel 600% (annual) inflation," he says, slapping several million-peso notes on the counter. "Our money is worth less every day, so why not spend now? Things will only be more expensive tomorrow."
NEW YORK -- The credit markets took a breather yesterday after a strong rally late Wednesday.</br></br>Most interest rates wound up little changed in quiet activity. Bond prices fell slightly as the Treasury sold $7 billion of new 10-year notes in another in a string of auctions scheduled until Thanksgiving.</br></br>The average annual yield on the Treasury notes was 9.54%. That was down from 10.6% at the previous auction of similar notes held Aug. 7 and was the lowest since May 1979.</br></br>Traders paid little attention to a Federal Reserve System report late yesterday that showed the basic money supply rose $1.5 billion in the week ended Nov. 11. The increase in the money measure, known as M1, was roughly in line with forecasts of most analysts in several surveys earlier this week.</br></br>Wednesday's bond market rally was sparked by speculation that Congress finally will approve legislation designed to force large budget cuts soon and balance the budget by 1991. The credit markets' outlook depends heavily on what happens to that proposed legislation, according to Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.

The atmosphere of financial crisis that was gripping Japan eased Tuesday following a spectacular 13 percent rise on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</br></br>The market continued to climb today, with the Nikkei stock index gaining 1.4 percent in the two-hour morning session to close at 23,229.57.</br></br>Tuesday's rally, the biggest in Japan's history, was triggered by a government announcement of measures aimed at boosting market confidence, plus a slew of favorable news including falling oil prices, lower interest rates, sharp rises in foreign stock markets and agreement on a U.S. deficit-cutting plan.</br></br>But the magnitude of Tuesday's surge-a 2,676.75-point rise in the Nikkei-left analysts uneasy about the market's future direction.</br></br>If anything, some experts said, the market's sudden change from utter despair to unbridled euphoria underscores how group-oriented Japanese investors are exceptionally susceptible to a mass stampede.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker said yesterday there was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no inconsistencyï¿½Û in the Fed's concern about inflation and its recent decision to lower the discount rate.</br></br>In a speech to the Harvard Alumni Association, Volcker said the decision May 17 to lower the discount rate from 8 percent to I'h percent "took place under particular circumstances.ï¿½Û</br></br>The circumstances included ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a strong dollar, ample [unused production) capacity and slow growth,ï¿½Û all of which tend to reduce inflationary pressures, he said.</br></br>Some economists who focus on the growth of the money supply as a cause of future inflation have complained that the Federal Reserve is allowing the most closely watched measure of money.

VIRGINIA SEN. Ken Cuccinelli II (R-Fairfax) has introduced a piece of immigrant-bashing legislation that is meant to ease the way for bosses to fire workers who don't speak English. But the bill is so closed-minded and foul-tempered that it is too much for Mr. Cuccinelli himself. It would victimize employees who fail "to speak only English at the workplace," a formulation even the senator now allows is a bit harsh; who knows, maybe his own ancestors were known to utter a phrase or two in their native Italian on the job. So he has decided to remove the word "only" from his bill. Nice, but it doesn't help.</br></br>The senator, long regarded as among the more intolerant lawmakers in Richmond, has outdone himself. He says glibly that the bill responds to a growing problem of employees who are unfit for their jobs because they speak English poorly. The rub, he says, is that employers cannot fire them without risking higher taxes to pay unemployment benefits. His evidence? Well, says the senator, an employer complained to him about it. And who was that employer? Mr. Cuccinelli can't recall.</br></br>The senator's porous memory notwithstanding, his legislation highlights a few pertinent facts about the immigration debate:</br></br>First, xenophobia. Despite their protestations, the anti-immigrant crowd tends to blur the line between legal and illegal immigrants and tar them with the same brush. Although Mr. Cuccinelli spent much of his campaign for the state Senate last fall bashing illegal immigrants, this bill would apply only to legal immigrants, since illegal immigrants are already ineligible for unemployment benefits.</br></br>Second, overzealousness. Mr. Cuccinelli's bill rates poor English as an offense on a par with substance abuse, lying about past criminal convictions, missing work and committing infractions that cost an employer his business license -- all of them equal grounds for denying unemployment benefits to a fired worker. That's absurd on its face.
WASHINGTON -- Rising gasoline prices in the wake of Hurricane Katrina generally were the result of the forces of supply and demand, a Federal Trade Commission study found. But the agency identified scattered instances of price gouging, a finding likely to inflame congressional debate over pending federal legislation.</br></br>The FTC study, ordered by Congress last year, is expected to be a major focus of a Senate hearing today.</br></br>Overall, the FTC report offered support for the petroleum industry, which has been dogged by price-gouging accusations after Katrina idled 27% of U.S. crude-oil production and 13% of the nation's refining capacity. The average price of gas in six representative cities spiked 50 cents after the storm hit land on Aug. 29, declined 35 cents over two weeks and then jumped by additional 25 cents after Hurricane Rita hit in late September, the FTC report said.</br></br>"In light of the amount of crude-oil production and refining capacity knocked out by Katrina and Rita, the sizes of the post- hurricane price increases were approximately what would be predicted by the standard supply-and-demand paradigm," the report said.</br></br>The report found that several refiners saw their profit margins rise after the hurricanes in ways that weren't attributable to increased costs, and 15 separate instances of gouging by refiners, dealers and stations were cited. The FTC said these increases mirrored local trends in all but one case when geography and other factors were considered.
The expanding army of homeless, the increasing filth of our streets, tightening educational and police protection budgets, and the snowballing real price of medical care, higher education, performing arts, legal services and insurance are all inescapable realities of life. Every industrial country suffers from these symptoms to some degree, but, as in other fields, they are still a few years behind us.</br></br>What has gone wrong and what, if anything, can be done? While no single cause can account for these complex problems, one influence explains a good deal, and suggests the way out.</br></br>Productivity stagnation in the service industries has led to persistent rises in their costs. The laggard services include, most notably, health care, education, legal services, welfare programs for the poor, postal service, police protection, sanitation, repair services, the performing arts and restaurants. Their common element is the handicraft character of their production, requiring large labor inputs that are resistant to curtailment.</br></br>There are at least two reasons why rapid and persistent productivity growth has eluded these stagnant services. First, some of them are inherently hard to standardize. Before one can cure a patient or repair a broken piece of machinery, it is necessary to determine, case by case, just what is wrong, and the treatment must then be tailored to the individual case.</br></br>A second reason why it has been difficult to reduce the labor content of these services is that in many of them quality is, or is believed to be, inescapably correlated with the amount of labor expended on them. Teachers who cut down the time they spend on their classes or who increase class size, doctors who speed up the examination of patients, or a police force that spends less time on the beat, are all held to be shortchanging those whom they serve.
New York's Mayor David Dinkins last month formed a committee to advise him on New York City's competitiveness in financial services. Friday, the committee produced the following statement on the stock transfer tax, one of the proposals being considered by the president and Congress in this week's budget negotiations:</br></br>Recent discussions of the federal budget deficit have raised the possibility of a securities transfer excise tax of between 15 and 50 basis points, or 0.15% and 0.5%. STET would tax all sales of marketable securities (including stocks, bonds and commercial paper) other than Treasuries. Reaction to this proposal has been overwhelmingly negative. Several studies demonstrate the adverse impact STET would have on the U.S. economy and, in particular, on New York. We agree with the emerging consensus that STET would seriously, and perhaps irreversibly, damage the competitive viability of the U.S. securities markets and its financial institutions. STET would also have the short-term effect of further depressing the U.S. stock market, which has already fallen by 10% since mid-July.</br></br>To help foster public understanding as to why STET would cause severe, self-inflicted injury to our financial markets, impairing their global competitiveness, we address the most important issues raised in regard to STET.</br></br>How can a tax of of less than half a percent erode the competitive position of the U.S. securities industry?</br></br>The tax only appears to be insignificant. Total transaction costs typically paid by institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies (which are responsible for 70% of trading) are only four or five basis points. Thus, at 15 basis points, STET would triple transaction costs for institutions.
NEW YORK -- Recession called on account of peace? Don't bet on it.</br></br>Economists say that even if the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved peacefully, it will be too late to stave off a recession.</br></br>"The damage has been done," says Joseph Wahed, economist at Wells Fargo. "Companies have canceled or postponed plans; people have been laid off." And while peace in Kuwait would no doubt help, it's unlikely to quickly reverse the economy's downward momentum.</br></br>"It's easy to blame it all on Saddam Hussein," says Merrill Lynch economist Bruce Steinberg, "but the problems were there before. This is the final unwinding of an expansion that lasted eight years."</br></br>Up until the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the great majority of economists thought the U.S. would skirt past a recession. Some, in fact, had cobbled together a theory that recessions were a thing of the past -- that while individual regions or industries might suffer "rolling recessions," the country as a whole could keep eating cake forever.

MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Presidential candidate Newt Gingrich said on Monday that younger workers should be allowed to divert a portion of their Social Security taxes to private investment accounts, leaving Mitt Romney as the only leading GOP contender not to advocate fundamental changes to the federal retirement program.</br></br>Younger workers also could opt to remain in the current Social Security system under Mr. Gingrich's plan.</br></br>The goal of private-account plans is to allow market returns to replace taxpayer-funded benefits, saving the government money. Mr. Gingrich's proposal, which he outlined in a speech here, is similar to an unsuccessful effort by former President George W. Bush to revamp the popular retirement program for seniors.</br></br>But Mr. Gingrich said his proposal would guarantee that anyone who invested in personal savings accounts would receive as much as traditional Social Security pays out.</br></br>Some conservative supporters of private accounts for Social Security dismissed such guarantees as impractical, saying it meant the government would retain market risk. "It doesn't make any sense to do that . . . Guarantees don't work," said Thomas Saving, a conservative economist at Texas A&M University who helped design Mr. Bush's plan as a member of his Social Security commission.
CASH MAY NO LONGER be king.</br></br>Sticking with a money-market fund has been a smart strategy over the past year, as interest rates have climbed and as short-term yields have rivaled those on longer-term bonds. But with 10-year Treasury notes recently breaking above 5% for the first time in almost four years, this could be a good time for cash investors to take a little more risk.</br></br>Here's the case for tiptoeing into short- and intermediate-term bonds, while also snapping up inflation-indexed Treasurys.</br></br>-- Stepping out. When interest rates climb, your first instinct should be to lengthen the average maturity of your bond portfolio, so you take advantage of the higher yields.</br></br>And interest rates, of course, have risen. At yesterday's market close, 10-year Treasury notes were paying a tad less than 5%, up from 4.4% at the end of 2005 and 3.1% in June 2003. Problem is, short-term interest rates have also climbed, pushing up the average yield on taxable money-market funds to 4.2%.
In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a "conundrum" in congressional testimony earlier this year.</br></br>It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.</br></br>Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.</br></br>---</br></br>Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time.
Blue-chip stocks broke a three-day losing streak in a volatile day on Wall Street as investors looked for bargains and shunned usually hot technology stocks.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, which had been down as much as 115 points early in the day, rallied in the afternoon to close up 85.32 at 10,304.84.</br></br>The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index, however, was unable to shake off concerns about interest rates and fell 29.62, to 4382.12. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 6.08, to 1352.17.</br></br>Today's performance was a marked change from the recent trend on Wall Street that has pushed the Nasdaq up more than 8 percent this year and the Dow down 11 percent.</br></br>"What you are really seeing today is what has been oversold, the Dow, is coming back. And what was overbought, the Nasdaq, is having a correction," said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at First Union Securities in Chicago.
PANAMA CITYï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Psychological warfare, a leftward drift by the government and reports of growing Cuban involvement here are combining to further muddle Panamaï¿½Ûªs Dolitical and economic crisis.</br></br>Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegaï¿½Ûªs battle to stay in power, despite U.S. economic pressure aimed at ousting him, includes psychological operations that the former intelligence officer is believed to direct, possibly with some Cuban advice.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Noriega is like a gutter fighter, and there is no more to him than that,ï¿½Û said a former top government official and political ally. Referring to psychological warfare, however, he conceded: "At that grim area of human activity, the guy seems to be brilliant.ï¿½Û</br></br>Sometimes, though, it is difficult to know where these ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½psy opsï¿½Û end and reality begins. And many things that happen in Panama seem to make no sense either way.</br></br>"I call Panama the twilight zone,ï¿½Û said Luis Martins, a spokesman of an opposition political party. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It defies logic. Two and two donï¿½Ûªt add up to four in Panama.ï¿½Û
David Morgan, manager of a Citizens Bank branch in Capitol Heights, looked a bit startled as a serious-looking foursome, clad to a man in conservative pin stripes, climbed out of a dark blue government van and strode into his lobby yesterday.</br></br>"Skip Hove, chairman of the FDIC," said the first, extending a hand to Morgan. Another, Office of Thrift Supervision acting director Jonathan L. Fiechter, knew they looked a bit intimidating.</br></br>The four - the federal government's top bank regulators - weren't there to go over the bank's books, but to try to find out why bank services are scarce in many black communities, rich and poor.</br></br>Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Andrew C. Hove Jr., Fiechter, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig and Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence B. Lindsey are used to worldly discussions of economics in sedate marbled chambers. But yesterday they went a few miles from their downtown Washington offices to a world where it costs $1.99 to cash a $25 check and 29-cent stamps cost 40 cents.</br></br>They were there to get a first-hand look at why working-class blacks on Central Avenue patronize expensive check cashing outfits instead of banks and why upper-middle-class blacks in $200,000 Lake Arbor town houses complain that they have to go to mortgage companies because banks won't lend to them.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK - Online-brokerage houses saw some hopeful signs in October and the first part of November, with trading activity picking up as the political uncertainty that hung over investors dissipated once the presidential election was decided.</br></br>E*Trade Financial Corp. said Monday that trading activity picked up last month, providing the latest evidence of a potential recovery in the online-brokerage industry.</br></br>The online financial-services firm said it processed an average of 123,112 total revenue-producing trades a day for its investor clients in October, up 25.8% from September but down 14.1% from October 2003. Margin-debt levels fell 1% sequentially.</br></br>E*Trade President R. Jarrett Lilien said the political uncertainty that kept some investors on the sidelines eased as October wore on and the U.S. presidential election approached.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher tonight called on U.S. policy makers to heed her example of raising taxes when necessary to cut budget deficits and said such cuts must be "sufficient to restore confidence, clearly and decisively."</br></br>Noting that President Reagan and Congress "are still negotiating" over the deficit, Thatcher implied they should ignore "contradictory advice from their own economists," some of whom have warned that tax increases would lead to recession.</br></br>Thatcher's comments, in a speech to leading financiers at the annual banquet of the Lord Mayor of London, were the most specific yet in a series of public statements over the past several weeks urging the Reagan administration to take decisive action to reduce the U.S. budget and trade deficits.</br></br>As Reagan's closest international ally and a fellow conservative, Thatcher, according to her aides, has tried repeatedly over the years to impress on him the need to balance the U.S. budget, no matter what the short-term political cost. She and other allied leaders have been closely following the intense negotiations in Washington, which they see as crucial to reversing the international economic crisis that began with the Oct. 19 stock market plunge.</br></br>Thatcher noted that "the current situation cannot be laid only at America's door." Among the other causes, she cited persistent Japanese and West German trade surpluses that have been sustained, particularly in the case of Japan, by protectionism.
At first glance, Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III appeared to have made a major gain yesterday in his efforts to buoy the world economy.</br></br>The decision yesterday by seven European central banks to lower key interest ratescapped a 10-day period during which European governments announced a steady stream of fiscal and monetary measures aimed at spurring economic growth. The actions, which Baker strongly urged, raised hopes that the Treasury chief will soon engineer an international agreement designed to check the dollar's precipitous fall, hold down interest rates and avert worldwide recession.</br></br>Such an agreement, in turn, could bolster Baker's hopes of keeping the economy afloat during the 1988 election campaign, with obvious benefits for the Republican side.</br></br>But many economists caution that Baker's initiatives won't fundamentally alter the global economy's underlying problems. In their view, Baker appears to be obtaining only modest progress toward shrinking the huge U.S. budget and trade deficits and the need to borrow vast sums of money from abroad.</br></br>And as yesterday's steep stock market decline makes plain, Baker's efforts may not be enough to ward off new waves of pessimism in financial markets in the months ahead.

Prices steadied as the pace of trading slackened, and then came a slow and gradual ascent. Losses in many pivotal stocks were reduced by substantial margins.</br></br>The selling earlier in the day was various-I ly attributed to tight money and firming interest rates (leading commercial banks in I several cities upped the prime rate they charge on loans to top-grade borrowers) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and to unfavorable developments in the Suez Canal dispute.

LONDON -- U.S. bank issues are losing their luster in the Eurodollar bond market. Worries about the U.S. banking system are prompting international investors to pay more for the traditionally less-coveted debt of European banks than for that of U.S. banks.</br></br>Only a year ago, U.S. banks were widely regarded as benchmark international borrowers and could pay the lowest interest rates in the Eurodollar floating-rate note market. But currently U.S. banks are paying a higher average interest rate on their notes than Austrian, British, Canadian, Japanese and West German banks, according to a report by Jeffrey Hanna and Gioia M. Parente, analysts at Salomon Brothers Inc., a New York investment bank.</br></br>While this reversal is partly the result of a recent heavy supply of new U.S. bank issues in the Euromarket, it also stems from "international concern regarding the soundness of the U.S. banking system," the Salomon analysts say. Moreover, the trend isn't likely to disappear in the near future, they add.</br></br>Several prominent Eurobond specialists agree, noting that international credit markets have been buffeted this year by the collapse of some small U.S. government securities dealers and by the temporary closing of 70 thrift institutions in Ohio.</br></br>"No doubt about it, there's much more skittishness toward U.S. banks in the international capital market," says Hans-Joerg Rudloff, deputy chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., the leading underwriter of bonds and floating-rate notes in the Eurobond market.
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo.--Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke Friday said the central bank stands ready to provide further support to a persistently weak economy, but didn't indicate any move was imminent despite fresh signs of feeble growth.</br></br>In a much-anticipated speech to global monetary policymakers gathered in Wyoming, Mr. Bernanke didn't elaborate on the central bank's remaining tools to boost the economy, which could have been a sign that the Fed was leaning toward action. Instead, he said the Fed would extend its mid-September meeting to two days to discuss options the central bank could pursue.</br></br>"The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability," Mr. Bernanke said.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened lower and fell as much as 221 points right after Mr. Bernanke's comments. But stocks pared losses as some market participants applauded the Fed's measured approach. The Dow rose 134.72 points to close at 11284.54.</br></br>Bond investors, however, bought safe-harbor Treasury bonds amid rising fears that the U.S. economy is headed into a recession, sending prices on the benchmark 10-year note higher.
NEW YORK, April 30 UP).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The stock ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½market launched a . great buying spree today with vigor, and then it stumbled over'profit-taking arid closed in a ragged manner;</br></br>The rapid fire opening of the market marked the third straight day of advancing prices and the second time that the market on average probed into new high ground for the past 24 years.</br></br>Buyers came tumbling into the market a; the start. Great blocks of blue chips dotted the tape at higher prices. Other stocks followed right along.</br></br>By early afternoon, there was evidence of profit-taking. That, expanded until it engulfed most areas of the list. Prices were thoroughly mixed at the close with many of the former leaders on the downside.</br></br>Most major divisions we're mixed. Railroads and coppers were down on balance. The oils did quite well and many motion picture issues were ahead.
Mortgage rates started off 2000 by hitting their highest levels since August amid fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month.</br></br>The average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to 8.15 percent for the week ending Jan. 7, up from 8.06 percent last week, according to a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac.</br></br>Before late August, the last time mortgage rates were this high was April 18, 1997, when they reached 8.16 percent.</br></br>Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also were up this week with an average rate of 7.73 percent this week, up from the average rate of 7.66 percent last week.</br></br>On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average initial rate of 6.60 percent this week, up from 6.56 percent the previous week.
Financial security has rarely looked so unappealing.</br></br>Bonds and bond mutual funds are supposed to offer a comforting dose of certainty. You typically have an excellent idea of how much interest you will collect each year and what price you will receive when you go to sell.</br></br>But today, that virtue looks like a vice. Even the longest-dated Treasury bonds pay less than 5%. To make matters worse, many folks fear rising interest rates will pummel bond prices.</br></br>What to do? In this week's and next week's column, I will offer some pointers on how to navigate 2006's treacherous bond market and how to build a portfolio that should serve you well in the years ahead. Today's contention: The current worries are overblown -- and they certainly shouldn't dissuade you from having at least a portion of your portfolio in bonds.</br></br>Bonds may be unappealing, but stocks aren't much better. They trade at lofty price/earnings multiples and they pay skimpy dividend yields.
High rents and a shortage of apartments have combined to make rental housing expensive and difficult to find for many Washington area families and individuals, according to the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. The council based its conclusion on a recently completed survey of more than 238,000 rental units in the region.</br></br>A 4.7 percent rent increase in District of Columbia rent-controlled units, which is scheduled to take effect April 1, will make apartments in the city even more expensive. The automatic annual rent increase is based on the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers. Last year's rent increase was 1.6 percent.</br></br>The COG study, released last week, said the median rent for all rental housing in the area is $630 per month. When broken down by size, the medians ranged from $500 for an efficiency apartment to $917 for a unit with four or more bedrooms. The median is the point at which half of all apartments cost more and half cost less.</br></br>COG launched the survey after the Department of Housing and Urban Development set the level of federal rental subsidies so low that more than a third of the families in the metropolitan area were unable to find housing they could afford, even with government aid. The results "clearly demonstrate" that proposed subsidies published last August in the Federal Register "do not reflect the true rental market and justify" an increase in federal assistance, the report said.</br></br>On the basis of the findings, the Council of Governments asked for an increase of about 10 percent in the amount of federal housing subsidies for this area. HUD is expected to approve the increase soon, said David Robertson, COG housing planner and author of the report.
-- A U.N.-appointed panel investigating influence peddling in the oil-for-food program in Iraq is examining three contacts between Secretary General Kofi Annan and executives of a Swiss company that made payments to Annan's son while it conducted millions of dollars' worth of business with the world body, a senior U.N. official said.</br></br>The U.N. chief of staff, Mark Malloch Brown, made the disclosure less than a week before former Federal Reserve chairman Paul A. Volcker is due to issue a report on whether Kojo Annan improperly used his family connections to obtain a U.N. contract for his former employer, Cotecna Inspection SA, in December 1998.</br></br>Malloch Brown described Annan's meetings as "innocent encounters" that played no role in securing contracts for the Geneva-based firm and said the secretary general told investigators about them. He said that Annan is confident he "will be exonerated of any wrongdoing" but that Volcker will determine whether the actions of his son were "appropriate or not."</br></br>The $64 billion U.N. oil-for-food program was created in December 1996 to provide Iraq with an exemption from sanctions, which had been imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, to sell oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian goods. The former Iraqi government collected more than $2 billion in bribes and kickbacks from companies trading with Iraq under the program.</br></br>Annan appointed Volcker in April to investigate allegations of misconduct by U.N. personnel. Last month, Volcker accused Benon Sevan, the former director of the oil-for-food program, of asking the Iraqi government to steer valuable oil contracts to an Egyptian businessman. Sevan insists he has done nothing wrong.
With high energy costs the main culprit, consumer price inflation, at least temporarily, is eating up the lion's share of the average American's annual increase in wages.</br></br>The consumer price index rose 0.6 percent last month and 3.7 percent over the past 12 months, the fastest rate of increase since 1991, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Over the same period, average hourly wages for production and non- supervisory workers increased 3.6 percent, according to earlier department reports. Those figures include overtime pay but not bonuses or fringe benefits.</br></br>Most analysts think this situation will be short-lived, because many energy prices appear close to a peak, the food and beverage prices rose only 0.1 percent last month, and the rest of the consumer price index--the "core," which excludes both food and energy prices-- rose 0.2 percent for the third month in row. Since June 1999 the core CPI is up 2.4 percent, but it rose at a slower 2 percent rate in the past three months, the department said.</br></br>On the energy front, there already has been some relief. In recent weeks, Saudi Arabia has proposed increasing production by 500,000 barrels daily but so far has not gotten agreement from other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to do so.
Housing markets haven't found a bottom so much as a temporary foothold.</br></br>The S&P/Case-Shiller gauge of home prices in 20 major cities, released Tuesday, showed a monthly gain in April--its first such increase since July 2010. A pair of reports due Wednesday may build on that, creating a rare stretch of decent news for the beleaguered market.</br></br>Pending sales of previously owned homes--a leading gauge of closings--are expected to rebound by at least 10% in May after falling 11.6% in April. Meanwhile, home builder KB Home, the nation's fifth-largest by 2010 sales, will be out with fiscal second-quarter results that may show some signs of stabilization after a nasty first quarter.</br></br>When it comes to U.S. housing, though, good news is relative.</br></br>On a yearly basis, the Case-Shiller index is down about 4%. Capital Economics reckons prices won't start rising consistently until 2014. Despite rock-bottom interest rates, mortgage applications remain tepid. Moreover, the glut of roughly 4.5 million homes in some stage of delinquency or foreclosure will continue to stalk the market.
Once every month, James Druckrey, marketing vice president of American Tourister Inc., sits down with top executives of the Warren, R.I., luggage maker to forecast the coming month's business.</br></br>For the past year, the very first item on his agenda has been the Conference Board's latest reading on consumer confidence. Right now, its reading is abysmal.</br></br>So, one would expect to find Mr. Druckrey pessimistic. But he isn't. "We're guardedly optimistic there will be some turnaround in the economy," he says.</br></br>Production planners in businesses around the country are facing the same paradox: Business seems to be turning up, but some closely watched measures of consumer confidence aren't.</br></br>Last week, the Conference Board, a business-research organization based in New York, said its confidence index had fallen to the lowest level since the bleak, oil-shock days of December 1974. In short order, stock prices sank; Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pronounced the report "very disturbing"; USA Today and the Washington Post put the bad news at the top of their front pages, and CBS made it the lead story on its evening news.
Warren Buffett is poised to disclose a blockbuster 2013, with record earnings expected when the billionaire investor releases his company's annual report on Saturday.</br></br>Berkshire Hathaway Inc.'s earnings should reflect an improving economy, a soaring stock market and the lack of a major catastrophe that could have put a dent in the conglomerate's insurance profits.</br></br>At the same time, the market's steep climb last year probably means Mr. Buffett will miss his own target for increasing Berkshire's net worth.</br></br>Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Berkshire to post, on average, annual revenue of about $180 billion, up roughly 11% from 2012. The Omaha, Neb.-based company is projected to report net profit of about $18.5 billion, up from $14.8 billion in 2012.</br></br>Berkshire will release its annual report and its annual letter to shareholders Saturday morning. The release of the letter is a much-awaited event, not just for Berkshire shareholders but for the wide universe of acolytes who look to the 83-year-old chairman for investing wisdom and insights.

Federal Reserve chairman Arthur Burns yesterday reversed his position and came out against making the chairmanï¿½Ûªs term coincide more closely with that of the President.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The consequence,ï¿½Û he told a House Banking Subcommittee, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½could be some politicizing of the Federal Reserve, and perhaps some erosion of the independence of the nationï¿½Ûªs monetary authority.ï¿½Û</br></br>Decisions on the nationï¿½Ûªs money supply, he said, might end up being made by some ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½political hack in the basement of the White Houseï¿½Û.</br></br>Last year Burns told Congress the-Federal Reserve Board had ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no objectionï¿½Û to making the two terms roughly coincide.

A Cabinet committee said yesterday the 4t2 per cent interest rate ceiling on Treasury bonds which Congress refused to raise is weakening tiie Government's ability to fight inflation.</br></br>The committee, headed by Vice President Richard M. .Nixon, said the ceiling plus the big budget deficit in the past fiscal year have thrown too much of the anti-inflation burden on Government in its efforts to restrain credit expansion.</br></br>The committee made the statement in the third of a series of papers on problems of the Nationï¿½Ûªs economic growth and price stability. The chief topic was how to manage the Federal budget, the huge national debt, and credit supply to promote economic growth without inflation.</br></br>Other committee members include the Secretaries of the Treasury, Commerce, Agriculture, Labor and the Postmaster General, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and W. Allen Wallis, executive vice chairman of the group.</br></br>The 4'-2 per cent interest ceiling applies to new sales of Treasury bonds maturing in five years or more. The Administration, pointing out that longterm interest rates exceed 4m per cent, asked Congress this year to lift the ceiling to permit the Treasury to do some long-term borrowing.
MARQUETTE, Mich., March 28ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rep.

The muted nature of the economic recovery was underscored yesterday by reports that new orders for long-lasting manufactured goods such as cars, refrigerators, steel and machine tools fell 3.8 percent last month, while sales of existing homes dipped 2.1 percent.</br></br>The drop in new orders for durable goods, however, was smaller than most analysts had expected, following an increase in July that was the largest in history.</br></br>Moreover, the July gain, originally put at 11.2 percent, was revised upward in yesterdayï¿½Ûªs report from the Commerce Department to 11.7 percent.</br></br>Gordon Richards, an economist for the National Association of Manufacturers, called the August drop in orders essentially a one-month aberration.</br></br>orders figures needed to be averaged over several months to see the trend, which is still upward, the August dip notwithstanding.
NEW YORK, March 16 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Railroad shares took sharp losses because of a renewed threat of a rail strike but gains by other sections of the list kept the stock market on an even keel today. Trading was moderately active.</br></br>The new danger of a rail walkout saw some of the leading carriers fall a point or more. For a while it looked as if the declining rails would draw down the whole market. A spate of late buying near the end, however, repaired some of the damage and the worst that could be said for stocks as a whole was that they were mixed.</br></br>The verdict of popular market indicators was conflicting. The Dow Jones industrial average nudged to a new peak of 816.48 with a gain of .26. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock index closed unchanged at 79.14. The Associated Press average declined.</br></br>Copper stocks made renewed gains amid widening reports of price increases for the red metal. Cigarette issues rallied following additional published reports that cigarette sales, which fell sharply following the Government report on smoking and health, were recovering.</br></br>Electrical equipments held fairly steady despite news of impending trials of damage suits based on price-fixing prosecutions of four years ago.

Stock prices finally settled on solid gains today after investors spent a wobbly session perplexed by another batch of mixed signals about the economy and earnings.</br></br>Buyers deemed a better-than-expected report on the economy to be a plus. But sellers fretted over the latest string of analyst downgrades of high-profile companies.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 50.66 at 10,647.33, bouncing back from several dips into negative territory.</br></br>The market's broader indicators followed the same path. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.58, to 2031.24, and the Standard & Poor's 500- stock index advanced 10.56, to 1223.14. It was the first time since June 7 that all three major indexes advanced.</br></br>Investors were feeling somewhat optimistic after hearing that the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators, a key forecasting gauge, rose 0.5 percent in May. The reading was better than the 0.3 percent analysts were expecting and a sign that the economy is poised to slowly recover.
From Manhattan to Montana, worries are mounting that a California-style electricity crisis could be on the way.</br></br>The problem is rooted in the nation's piecemeal, poorly thought-out utility-deregulation process, which planted time bombs that could continue to explode across the nation for years to come. Deregulation in the '90s prodded many utilities to sell off power plants and then to sign long-term contracts to buy back the output. Now, those contracts are expiring. That will mean utilities are going to be buying electricity at much higher prices on the open market -- at a time when ownership of power plants is increasingly concentrated in relatively few hands.</br></br>Another big problem: The transmission lines that carry electricity are growing old and overloaded. But in the chaotic world of deregulation, few have sufficient financial incentive to upgrade the lines. The result: In some parts of the country there may be no way to deliver enough power when and where it's needed most.</br></br>While the rest of the country is in better shape than California, some ominous clouds are already gathering. Supplies in several regions are tight. Prices are rising sharply, affecting not only consumers in the 24 states that have already been deregulated but even some in states that haven't. An ill-timed heat wave from Maine to Pennsylvania could plunge parts of the Northeast into a power crisis. The breakdown of a few big power plants in the West could reverberate through nearly a dozen states.</br></br>Whole chunks of the country, in other words, are balancing on "the knife's edge" between scant sufficiency and outright shortage, says Douglas Logan, a principal at energy firm RDI Consulting in Boulder, Colo.
NEW YORK, Dec. 22 Wk-A two-day .rise in the stock market proved to be a big lure for -thoï¿½Ûªse with profits, and late selling today cut the market well back from its best.ï¿½Ûª</br></br>The market was slightly higher at the close with gains running to around 3 points and losses going to around 2.</br></br>* Aircrafts were well out in front of the rise, as they have been for many days, and they were the first to feel the effects of the selling. They were mixed at the finish.</br></br>Steels closed unchanged to lower, motors higher, rubbers strong, radio-TVs mixed, utilities mixed, chemicals mixed, railroads lower, oils mixed, and coppers lower.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks was up 10 cents at $179.60, not too far away from its old record high ofï¿½ï¿½$181.50. The industrial component gained 30 cents, rails were off 10 cents, and utilities finished mixed.
NEW YORK -- Stocks, bonds and the dollar all stumbled coming out of the gate on the first day of trading in 1989.</br></br>The dollar tripped first in what traders said was a reaction to the artificially strong demand for the currency in the closing days of 1988. The weaker dollar, coupled with a report that indicated the economy remains strong in the face of rising short-term interest rates, sent bond prices sprawling. And after that the fall in stock prices was almost anti-climactic.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 23.93 to 2144.64 after being off nearly 40 points early in the afternoon. Computer-generated trading fueled much of the decline.</br></br>But analysts cautioned that yesterday's price action doesn't necessarily mean the financial markets have nowhere to go but down in 1989. "I think there's less here than meets the eye," said Peter Canelo, a portfolio strategist at Bear Stearns. "I don't think there's a clear direction on the economy, and there isn't any conviction about interest rates."</br></br>As 1988 drew to an end, investors were looking for signs that the economy is slowing in reaction to the Federal Reserve's steady effort to drive interest rates higher. Instead, the early evidence points to a stronger than expected economy in December that will require even more interest rate discipline. That hurts bond prices in the short run and increases the chances that when the economy does slow it could do so abruptly, perhaps falling into recession. A sharp slowdown would undermine corporate profits, the main prop for stock prices.

NEW YORK -- Earlier this year, rising energy prices cast a shadow over global bonds. Now, slipping energy costs are brightening prospects for longer maturities, which are the most susceptible to inflation concerns.</br></br>European Government Bonds may be the chief beneficiary of this shift. The specter of rising inflation fueled by higher energy prices loomed in mid-May, when gasoline futures spiked and crude oil was trading near $29 per barrel.</br></br>But that worry "is now off the agenda," says Mike Ryan, chief fixed-income strategist at UBS PaineWebber in New York. Global bond markets "are not overly concerned right now" about inflation, he says. Against this backdrop, global inflation concerns have been exaggerated, and inflation should fall in many areas of the world by next year in delayed response to slower growth and declining factory-utilization rates, Deutsche Bank strategists expect.</br></br>"For all major yield curves," this scenario offers "positive inflation news," says Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income strategist at Lehman Brothers in New York. In the euro zone, for instance, inflation is expected to fall to 1.8% in 2002 from 2.7% this year, Deutsche Bank estimates.</br></br>Declines in global energy prices "will certainly be welcome" at the European Central Bank and should give the ECB more elbow room to cut interest rates, says Cary Leahey, senior economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York.

There haven't been many changes in the number of people filing initial claims for government unemployment benefits, a closely watched indicator of layoffs. In the week ended Saturday, initial jobless claims held steady nationwide at a seasonally adjusted level of 318,000, not much more than the 315,000 who filed a year earlier.

A hike in the national minimum wage seems all but certain to become one of the first fruits of the Democrats' victories this week. Nancy Pelosi, the presumptive Speaker of the House, has pledged to raise the minimum by over $2, to $7.25 from $5.15. And President Bush has already signaled he'd go along. At the state level, six states not only approved minimum wage hikes in referendums this week but indexed the minimum to inflation going forward. We hope Mr. Bush fights off any attempt at federal indexation and insists on a provision to protect small business.</br></br>Raising the minimum wage has been a hardy perennial of the left for decades now. What is striking is the degree to which is has come to be seen as an economic free lunch. Even some reputedly unbiased economists have started to tout the view that raising the minimum wage has no discernible effect on job creation.</br></br>But if this were true, they'd be calling for a $10, $20 or even $50- an-hour minimum wage. They're not, and neither is Nancy Pelosi. That's because the law of demand is one of the most dependable precepts of economics. It says that when the price of something goes up, demand for it goes down. An employee's wages are the price the employer pays for his services, so raising their wages means forcing employers to pay more for workers. The price goes up and there is downward pressure on demand for workers. Other things being equal, jobs are lost.</br></br>For a long time, this was so obvious that no serious person doubted it. But a couple of studies in the 1990s purported to find no evidence of job loss associated with minimum-wage hikes, and it's been off to the races ever since. Classical economics teaches that for a given job, there is a market-clearing price -- the price at which both someone is willing to do it and someone else is willing to pay them to do it. If you raise the legal minimum above that price, you may get more people willing to perform the job, but you'll probably also get less people (employers) willing to pay the new, higher price to get the job done.</br></br>To picture how this works, think about the grocery bagger in the supermarket, a classic low-wage service job. Supermarkets hire grocery baggers for the minimum wage, or close to it, because it's a perk that makes their customers' experience a bit nicer and helps move the lines along, possibly requiring fewer cashiers, who cost more to hire than grocery baggers.
More Liquidity Only Douses Growth Sparks</br></br>Today's ultralow interest rates have helped boost profits, but not economic growth.</br></br>This is plainly evident in recent figures. Since the recession ended in mid-2009, U.S. corporate profits have jumped by about 43% to a record $1.45 trillion as of the first quarter, after taxes, inventory and accounting adjustments, according to the Commerce Department.</br></br>What hasn't recovered, however, is economic growth. Indeed, in real terms, gross domestic product hasn't even returned to its prerecession peak.</br></br>On Friday, Commerce data is likely to show GDP losing further ground. Second-quarter growth, originally reported at a measly 1.3%, is expected to be revised down to 1% in part because exports proved weaker than first thought. That follows GDP growth of just 0.4% in the first quarter, on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis.
Excerpts from remarks by former California governor Edmund G. "Jerry" Brown Jr. in the living room of Rose and Richard Arthur in Merrimack, N.H., on Jan. 11:</br></br>This is a campaign which I like to call an insurgency campaign and the reason I say that is because we're trying to do something that I don't see done that often in politics, and that really is make a change. Something you can see and feel and experience.</br></br>The reason why I believe so many people don't vote anymore is because they don't feel that their vote will actually add any difference to their lives - either good or bad. It's just another empty ritual that comes along and they don't want to take part. And I think that's a very damning statement about the state of politics.</br></br>Now when everything goes along fine and people are having economic security and opportunity, maybe that voter participation doesn't have the same significance. But when, as we see {in} . . . so many other places in the country, a real decline in opportunity and real hardship and people losing their jobs, then we look to the political system for some kind of redress, for some kind of sustenance and leadership to do what isn't being done.</br></br>And it is my point here in this campaign, the reason why I am here, is I don't think the political system is responding, or will respond. You're going to see a lot of money coming out of Washington because Bush is the president and he wants to get reelected. But in terms of what needs to be done to create real opportunity for the people of this country, I don't see it happening. . . .
Russian republic President Boris Yeltsin, moving to reassert his authority after nearly 100 days in office, promised today to push ahead with far-reaching economic reforms including the liberalization of virtually all prices and progress toward a separate Russian currency.</br></br>Speaking in an interview with Russian television, Yeltsin also promised to put an end to political squabbling among his closest aides by forming a new "government of popular confidence" in the next few days. He said an atmosphere of near-crisis had developed during his two-week Black Sea vacation because of differences about the future direction of Russia and the course of economic reform.</br></br>"People will suffer, but we have to go through with this," said Yeltsin, announcing that state controls on prices would be lifted soon in order to allow them to rise to free-market rates.</br></br>A former Communist Party bureaucrat with only a limited grasp of capitalist economics, Yeltsin had earlier shown little enthusiasm for implementing the painful measures associated with the transition to a market economy. But he has evidently concluded that short-term sacrifices will be necessary to rescue Russia from its deepening economic crisis and give people some long-term perspective of a better life.</br></br>Yeltsin, 60, who in June became the first popularly elected leader in Russia's 1,000-year history, has been strangely passive since he played the key role in defeating a coup attempt by hard-line Communists in August. His actions led to criticism that his character and political talents are more suited to the role of leader of the opposition than president of a huge country with vast problems.
The dollar plunged on a round of concerted dollar selling by central banks. The central-bank intervention backed up a weekend warning by major industrial nations that continued dollar strength could hurt the world economy.</br></br>The dollar tumbled to 1.8993 marks and 142.13 yen in late New York activity, down sharply from 1.9510 marks and 146 yen late Friday. The pound climbed to $1.6170 from $1.5715 Friday.</br></br>In Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar opened for trading at 142.25 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of 142.95 yen.</br></br>The Group-of-Seven major industrial countries -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued a communique in Washington on Saturday stating that the dollar's rise in recent months is "inconsistent with longer run economic fundamentals."</br></br>The central banks launched their attack on the U.S. currency early yesterday with dollar sales by the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of Canada in Far Eastern trading. Dealers said the Bundesbank, West Germany's central bank, intervened in the Tokyo and Singapore markets through West German commercial banks.

NEW YORK -- Gold futures locked in their second day of gains Thursday, spurred on by a weaker dollar and investors cheering the Federal Reserve's expectations of a protracted period of low interest rates.</br></br>The most actively traded contract, for February delivery, gained $26.60, or 1.6%, to settle at $1,726.70 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

NEW YORK, Oct. 18 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sagging blue chips dragged the stock market down to a fairly sharp loss in quiet trading today.</br></br>Pivotal issues fell from fractions to more than a point on a broad front. A number of selected issues met enough speculative demand, however, to move higher in active dealings.</br></br>The market was still laboring under the technical disadvantage of having failed to carry its recovery move through the 600 level in the Dow Jones industrial average. After approaching it in yesterdayï¿½Ûªs first hour it backed away. At the same time, business news was unencouraging.</br></br>Third quarter earnings reports continued to reflect a squeeze on profits. The sharp drop in housing starts reported for September brought this figure down to the lowest level since the 1958 recession and prompted Government economists to begin reassessing the economic future.</br></br>The market was slightly lower at the start, deepened its losses with no particular selling pressure, then steadied somewhat In late dealing when some of the higher-priced .stocks pared their losses.
The Reagan administration must reduce sharply its huge budget deficits, which cause high interest rates, or be saddled with the blame for not only an aborted global recovery, but also a continuing Third World debt problem, the Bank for International Settlements at Basle said yesterday.</br></br>In its annual report, the BISï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ sometimes called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the central, banksï¿½Ûª central bankï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½asserted that high U.S. interest rates are ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½damaging,ï¿½Û and that the responsibility for getting them down ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½clearly falls on the U.S. authorities, and squarely on the shoulders of those in charge of fiscal policy.ï¿½Û</br></br>The report also warned that there could be a second wave of trouble on the international debt front, characterizing the rescue packages put together last year and early this year as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½holding operationsï¿½Û that provided ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a vital breathing spaceï¿½Û and that now must be followed by concerted action.</br></br>It stressed that the debt situation ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½cannot be kept within manageable bounds without the effective participation of [private] banks,ï¿½Û urging that the banks maintain ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½steady nervesï¿½Û and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not withdraw from new international lending.ï¿½Û</br></br>Lower interest rates would be a tonic for the hard-pressed Third World debtors, the report pointed out. It warned that, while an international debt crisis may have been averted so far, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The worldï¿½Ûªs financial system remains basically fragile.ï¿½Û
A widely expected Federal Reserve increase in short-term rates sent bond prices falling and knocked stock prices down from their highs to mixed levels. The dollar was mixed.</br></br>The bond market, practically dormant through much of the morning, began churning once the Fed said at midafternoon that it had raised interest rates. But as economists read through the Federal Open Market Committee statement on the move, bond prices began to slump, especially among shorter-term issues.</br></br>Some economists noted that not only did the Fed increase the federal funds rate by 0.50%, but also the discount rate by the same margin. The fed funds rate is the bank overnight lending rate and the discount rate is the rate the Fed charges from its discount window. In addition to the rate boosts, the Fed termed signs of slowing as "tentative" and hinted that the economy remains quite vigorous, even as it raised rates for the seventh time in about one year.</br></br>The language that accompanied the Fed's move, especially about inflation and capacity utilization, along with the unanimous vote, telegraphed a certain sense of concern to the bond market," said Frazier Evans, senior economist for Colonial Investment Services.</br></br>In the stock market, a mild rally in cyclical issues rapidly escalated into a fierce argument between the two warring constituencies seeking control of the stock market. During the past two sessions, more than 800 million shares have traded hands as investors have wrestled with the recession question.
As the U.S. economy inches toward the "fiscal cliff," the country's small banks are approaching a cliff of their own, in a development that could pinch short-term lending rates.</br></br>On Jan. 1, a program that insures an unlimited amount of money in non-interest-bearing accounts will expire unless Washington moves to extend it. Without the Transaction Account Guarantee program, or TAG, an insurance cap resets to $250,000, affecting about $1.6 trillion in deposits.</br></br>And without insurance protection, depositors may be compelled to move amounts above $250,000 to other venues deemed safer, leaving the banks with less business.</br></br>J.P. Morgan estimates that, of that total, $579 billion could be on the move.</br></br>Big financial firms would be on the receiving end of these flows, where cash would either be moved into the perceived safer hands of larger banks or earn a sliver of interest at a conservative money fund. Safety is a big concern for investors as the federal government faces the potential "fiscal cliff," a set of tax increases and spending cuts that kick in on Jan. 1 if lawmakers can't reach a compromise plan, and which could send the economy into recession.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Home mortgage rates fell during the past week, as economic news reflected stable growth and low inflation, said Freddie Mac, the housing-finance agency.</br></br>The average for 30-year fixed mortgage rates for the week ended yesterday fell to 5.77% from 5.81% a week earlier, Freddie Mac said in its weekly primary mortgage-market survey. A year ago, the 30-year mortgage averaged 5.87%.</br></br>The rate for five-year Treasury-indexed hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages, a new addition to the primary mortgage-market survey, averaged 5.03%.</br></br>The rate for one-year Treasury-indexed ARMs fell to 4.10% from last week's average of 4.19%. A year ago, the one-year ARM averaged 3.76%.
NEW YORK, May 25 UP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market receded slightly this week in the area of its brand new 1957 highs, first weekly retreat in 13 weeks.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks dipped 40 cents to $184.50. This left it still within the zone of the string of new highs for the year established in the last two weeks but 60 cents below the latest high, established on Monday.</br></br>The Monday session was accompanied by a late ticker tape which fell behind buying orders early in the day. As on two occasions in the previous week this was regarded by some market technicians as a symptom of climactic buying in the three months rise. On Monday prices did nudge ahead to a new 1957 high but this proved to be the crest of the prolonged advance, at least for the time being.</br></br>The following three sessions were ones of mild reaction as values were clipped while profits were taken. At the same time, however, oils moved generally forward and there was a wide assortment of specialties which established big gains. Five of the most heavily traded issues of the week were oils.</br></br>On the final trading session prices advanced generally most of the day but precautionary pre-weekend selling near the close pared the rise to the slimmest margin. The day was a
One consequence of the financial crisis is that U.S. money-market funds have been buying more European bank debt.</br></br>The combination of U.S. banks issuing less debt and funds looking to diversify has seen European banks play a dominant role in U.S. money-market-fund portfolios. Even European debt fears haven't stemmed the appetite.</br></br>The percentage of foreign-bank obligations -- which largely are European and include Eurodollar certificates of deposit, Yankee dollar CDs and bankers' acceptances -- in prime money-market funds rose to 11.5% as of July from 9.8% a year earlier and 7.9% in July 2008, according to research firm iMoneyNet.</br></br>The research firm doesn't break out time deposits, such as fixed-term savings accounts and certificates of deposit, by geography. But one study at a Wall Street firm estimated most of those holdings are from European banks, and suggests European deposits are the single-biggest part of money-market funds' holdings.</br></br>Debbie Cunningham, head of money-markets funds at Federated Investors, said the financial crisis pushed funds overseas in two ways: The shock of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers Holdings going bust meant that fund managers saw greater imperative to diversify more to international holdings, while the recession -- and disappearing banks -- has shrunk the domestic commercial-paper-supply market as growth has stalled.
Circon Corp. is circling the wagons, rejecting U.S. Surgical Corp.'s unsolicited $230 million takeover bid and installing a so-called poison-pill shareholder rights plan.</br></br>Circon, a Santa Barbara, Calif., maker of surgical products, said it wasn't for sale and that the offer of $18 a share was "inadequate" in the opinion of its financial adviser, Bear Stearns & Co.</br></br>Shares of Circon yesterday fell 62.5 cents to $17.125 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, after jumping to over $19 following the tender offer, announced on Aug. 2. Circon shares were trading under $9 in late July, and U.S. Surgical points out that the offer was an 83% premium over the average closing price of the stock for the 10-day period prior to the bid. Yesterday, U.S. Surgical rose 37.5 cents to $35.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The shareholder rights plan effectively stops U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn., maker of surgical instruments, from acquiring 15% or more of the company by making it prohibitively expensive through the issuance of shares at a discount.</br></br>U.S. Surgical purchased about 8% of the shares of Circon before announcing its bid. Company insiders and former executives own a significant stake in Circon.
Aspiring Quant Traders Get Taste</br></br>Of the Fantasy Behind Equations</br></br>---</br></br>Web Site Allows Users to Practice in Simulated Setting</br></br>Aspiring investors can connect on a number of Facebook-like Web sites to discuss the nuts and bolts of the stock market and to practice trades in a simulated setting. But curious amateurs and fantasy traders have had far fewer options when it comes to quantitative trading, computerized trading that uses mathematical models and an assortment of data and variables.
JOHNSON INFLATION will be the major domestic issue of the 1966 congressional campaign. His deceptive guns-and-butter budget, which just a month ago was hailed as a political masterpiece, has turned out to be his first major political blunder.</br></br>His irresponsible refusal to face up to the danger of economic escalation at home at a time when we have military escalation abroad will cost his party scores of House and Senate seats in November; more important, it will cost those Americans who can least afford it billions of dollars in higher taxes and higher prices. <</br></br>His budget message should have been a declaration of war against inflation. Instead it was a declaration of Johnsonï¿½Ûªs War on Prosperityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a war in which the casualties will be the family budgets of millions of Americans.</br></br>THE AMERICAN people are entitled to have the answers to two questions: How did we get into this War on Prosperity? And how can we get out of it?</br></br>The answer to the first question is clear. As prices and taxes rise, Administration spokesmen will try to blame labor for demanding higher wages, they will try to blame business for asking for higher prices, they will try to blame the war in Vietnam.

WASHINGTON -- The robust economy has postponed the day of reckoning for Social Security's solvency by three years, until 2032, according to new estimates from the program's trustees.</br></br>And, at least in the near term, last year's balanced-budget law has greatly improved the outlook for Medicare, the federal health program for 38 million elderly and disabled people. It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.</br></br>The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the "strength in the U.S. economy" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.</br></br>As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.</br></br>The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.
NEW YORK -- Manhattan apartment sales slowed to a crawl in the wake of last week's stock market crash, but Wall's Street's turmoil didn't ignite any fire sales in the nation's most expensive housing market, according to brokers, developers and real estate lawyers.</br></br>"It's very quiet. Customers are hanging back. The phones aren't ringing the same way," said Esther Kaplan, an official at Corcoran Group, a Manhattan broker.</br></br>"I've talked to a dozen brokers, and I don't know anybody who has people even walking in their doors right now," added Stephen Raphael, a real estate attorney.</br></br>A few buyers who have gone to contract are trying to get their deposits back, brokers said. "A couple of lawyers have called to get their clients out of deals," said Martin Cohn, vice president, sales, at J.I. Sopher & Co., a Manhattan broker. "People are fishing for a way out. Some of them said to me, 'I don't have the money.'"</br></br>While the evidence is mostly anecdotal, real estate sources said the most hard-pressed group are newly rich, younger buyers who are purchasing their first expensive housing.
U.S. President Harry S Truman, weary of hearing his economists conclude "on the one hand, but then on the other hand," famously asked for a one-armed economist. He's fortunate he never found one. For any economist who feels certain about his reading of the economic tea leaves, who sees no "other hand," is, to put it mildly, more than a little overconfident.</br></br>All by way of excuse for this attempt to figure out just what is going on in the European Union and euroland.</br></br>On the one hand, things are brighter than they were last year, when the areas' economies were contracting at a rapid rate. No one is expecting that dismal performance to be repeated this year or next. But on the other, neither is anyone expecting anything like satisfactory growth. The Economist Intelligence Unit is guessing that growth will be at an annual rate of 1.0% and 1.1%, this year and in 2011, respectively.</br></br>The move out of recession is the result of an increase in exports. On the one hand that's good news: Otherwise, the EU economies would continue to shrink. But on the other hand, some of the increased exports, especially those from Germany to other euro-zone countries, are exacerbating serious imbalances. Germany's trade surplus with its EU partners is causing serious problems, especially for the struggling periphery countries.</br></br>"Germany's...trading partners cannot sustain deficits forever," notes the Economist.
South Korea faces a triple whammy of slowing economic growth, falling exports and weakening consumer demand. But it's still too early for Seoul to hit the panic button.</br></br>Thursday's economic data were weak--seasonally adjusted gross domestic product in the fourth quarter was up just 0.4% from the previous period, the slowest rate of growth since 2009 and below market expectations. More data due soon will also likely disappoint--the country may run its first trade deficit in two years in January.</br></br>With parliamentary and presidential elections later this year, the temptation to act swiftly will loom large. But knee-jerk policy steps would be foolish.</br></br>There is room for the Bank of Korea to cut interest rates if there is a sharp economic decline. Most analysts believe the central bank will deliver. The BOK considers its policy rate to be accommodative at 3.25%. Still, a cut of 0.25 percentage point could come as early as the first quarter of 2012. That should bolster consumer sentiment. But any gains could be offset if the won falls, stoking higher prices for important imports of energy and food.</br></br>Beyond that, further stimulus would be mistaken. The government has already front-loaded its 2012 budget to bring spending forward. Back in 2009, it also introduced a supplementary budget to boost the economy. Repeating that step now could also lead to inflationary pressures that would only crimp domestic spending.
In its first major ,action to relieve ,the long recession, Congressyesi^day gave final approval to a $4.6 billion jobs bill, and President Reagan quickly signed it, but riot before money for unemployment benefits ran out in a dozen states, including Virginia.</br></br>The measure, which was tied to a $5 billion appropriation to continue funding for jobless benefits in '27 states and the District of Columbia; reached the presidentï¿½Ûªs desk late in the evening, according to spokesmen, and Reagan signed it shortly thereafter^ ?</br></br>Although initially he had opposed spending for jobs creation, Reagan reversed course under pressure from both parties in Congress, and made a $4.3 billion jobs offer early last month, paving the way for what amounted to a bipartisan compromise on spending for recession relief.</br></br>But enactment did not come in time to keep Colorado, Montana, Vermont and Virginia from running out of money on Wednesday or to prevent a similar cutoff yesterday for Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and Missouri, according to the Labor Department. The Virgin Islands ran out of benefit money on Tuesday.</br></br>Eight other states and territories and the District of Columbia faced exhaustion of benefit funds by today, although Labor Department spokesman Jack Hashian said that the District had made plans to borrow, if necessary, in order to keep benefit, money flowing. Hashian also quoted Virginia officials as saying they would be able to meet most payments for three or four days.
More than one in three of the unemployed workers in several of the largest U.S. states have been out of a job for more than a full year.</br></br>Across the country, long periods of unemployment have been more prevalent recently than during previous recoveries going back to the 1940s.</br></br>During 2010, long-term unemployment was disproportionately a problem in New Jersey, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, North Carolina, Illinois and Florida, according to Labor Department data expected to be released later this month.</br></br>Nationally, 30% of the unemployed, or 4.4 million job seekers, were out of work for more than a year in June 2011, up from 29% of the unemployed in June 2010.</br></br>"I don't want us to say this is the new normal and move on," said Betsey Stevenson, the Labor Department's chief economist. "It really is going to take a concentrated effort of employers to give people a chance who haven't worked in a while."
Jan. 20, 1989 will mark the onset of a flood of new health, safety and environmental regulation that will swamp that of the early 1970s. Impossible? Didn't regulation dry up in 1980 with Ronald Reagan's mandate to "get the government off our backs"? To be sure, Watt, Burford & Co. attempted to curtail regulation, or at least to cork the flow. But they soon departed as liabilities, leaving the agencies with "technocrat" administrators and instructions not to antagonize either the public or business.</br></br>For six years Mr. Reagan has focused on taxes, the budget deficit and defense expenditures. Inattention has not solved the health and environmental problems. Six years of accumulating pressure is about to explode: The majority of Americans continue to want something done about toxic waste dumps, water quality, air pollution and occupational hazards.</br></br>No one should doubt the political appeal of these issues. Congress delayed adjournment and campaigning for reelection to pass the Superfund and Drinking Water Acts. Overwhelming majorities voted for laws that will impose major costs, that could be used to halt industry and that will do little to improve health or the environment. The bills focus on unrealistic worst cases and hypothetical risks, and embody unattainable goals; they divert attention from pressing environmental problems such as radon in homes. Just before an election, Mr. Reagan could have tested his 1980 mandate, vetoing burdensome, unsound legislation. If he had, the Republican Senate was ready to override.</br></br>Separately, he did veto an egregious pork-barrel "clean water" bill that included sewer projects. It's a good bet Congress will put that one over the top when it reconvenes.</br></br>Looking ahead to 1988, will presidential candidates tell the voters in New Hampshire that Mr. Reagan was right to do nothing about acid rain except some ill-focused research? Who will say that the Reagan regulatory agencies have done such a good job that no further action need be taken on air pollution, drinking water, waste dumps, occupational health and safety, and nuclear power?
NEW YORK -- Stocks ended more than a week of divergence by falling in unison.</br></br>High-tech stocks, one of the few sectors to hold up in recent trading, lost ground, as investors took profits in high-priced issues. That halted a streak of seven straight gains by the Nasdaq Composite Index.</br></br>Blue-chip issues such as Microsoft lost 5 15/16 to 104, while Intel, coming off a 52-week high Tuesday, declined 4 3/16 to 104 5/8 (both on the Nasdaq Stock Market), and Motorola declined 6 13/16 to 153 9/16.</br></br>Meanwhile, several of the momentum-driven high-tech issues that had persisted in the face of a broad decline in recent sessions got caught in the sell-off. Yahoo! fell 10 13/16 to 362 5/16, while Commerce One eased 9 3/4 to 155 3/8, and Conexant Systems, also coming off a 52-week high, fell 7 to 104 15/16, all on Nasdaq.</br></br>Some technology issues managed to gain. Juniper Networks rose 16 5/16 to 185 15/16, and Vitesse Semiconductor climbed 5 13/16 to 55 13/16, both on Nasdaq. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq), after an upbeat research note from Bear Stearns, gained 4 9/16 to 91 9/16. Nortel Networks advanced 1 3/4 to 122. Rival Lucent Technologies fell 1 1/8 to 53.
The spread of the Asian contagion to Russia and possibly Latin America is raising the specter of deflation, which to many conjures up images of the bread lines and apple sellers of the 1930s. Back then, U.S. wholesale prices dropped 32% as demand nose-dived in the face of bankruptcies, widespread unemployment and massive pay cuts.</br></br>Today we have financial crises aplenty in Asia, but they are unlikely to spread to the West. In the U.S., the long series of sectoral financial problems -- ranging from the farm-belt collapse in the early 1980s to difficulties related to the defense cutbacks of the early 1990s -- are behind us. Demand will probably not collapse in the West, even though there are some demand-reducing deflationary forces at work in the world. The Cold War is over, and the history of U.S. inflation is the history of wars. Since 1749, prices have risen at double-digit annual rates in wartime, but have fallen by more than 1% a year on average in peacetime. This isn't surprising, since the government is the only economic sector with enough financial credibility to outspend its revenues vastly and create excess demand for any length of time.</br></br>Wars on poverty are similarly inflationary, but the passage of welfare reform suggests that Washington is serious about cutting nondefense spending. Government spending in Europe is hemmed in by the Maastricht requirements for deficits and debts. And despite eight years of a deflationary depression, Japan remains unwilling to enact major tax cuts for fear of the budgetary consequences.</br></br>These are not the only deflationary forces at work. The Federal Reserve and other central banks continue to fight yesterday's war against inflation. Productivity-enhancing and cost-cutting restructuring prevails in this country and is spreading to Europe and Japan. Deregulation is bringing prices down. The continuing strength of the U.S. dollar encourages imports at lower costs, thereby forcing domestic competitors to reduce their selling prices.</br></br>Even more significant are deflationary forces that increase supply. Global sourcing is mushrooming low-cost supplies, and not just of goods. Software engineers in India are working for U.S. firms at 20% of what Americans cost. The shift in both Russia and especially China from the command economy model to unbridled, buccaneer capitalism is also creating huge new sources of supply. The collapsed Asian economies, including Japan, desperately want to increase exports to employ their citizens and earn hard currency to service their huge foreign debts. Include booming high-tech industries, and global supplies of almost everything will surge while prices will necessarily fall.
Lester Thurow's Fortune Favors the Bold is one of the most maddening books written on the international economy in many years. A Big Think book that offers few specific ideas about "building a lasting global prosperity" and leaves many key analytic dots unconnected, this latest popular work by the noted MIT economist nonetheless has much to teach anyone concerned about his or her pocketbook, the future of capitalism and everything economic in between.</br></br>By far the most important dots left inadequately connected by Thurow concern the mind-numbing international economic imbalances that the United States has piled up for roughly the last decade. Every presidential candidate -- especially the incumbent -- should read Thurow's discussion of these deficits and the nation's resulting international debts. For the author argues with unusual force and clarity that they represent mortal threats to the economic health of the United States as well as the rest of the world. Yet he overlooks what may be the main cause of these deficits.</br></br>The U.S. economy remains so strong that most Americans understandably ignore or simply don't know how deeply in debt the nation has sunk, and thus how heavily their living standards now depend on borrowing from abroad. This dependence results from Americans buying so much more from other countries than they sell to them, and from foreign creditors' willingness to provide affordable loans to fill the gap.</br></br>America's unique advantages have permitted prime-rate borrowing to continue despite these towering debts. In addition, much American borrowing during the 1990s was invested -- in theory promoting robust future growth.</br></br>More recent borrowing has been spent largely on consumer goods in a frenetic national shopping binge. America's economic and business establishment still believes that the debts can be managed without triggering national and worldwide recessions or worse. Thurow's greatest achievement is systematically demolishing the case for a so- called soft landing.
It's not my opinion, as I'm sure it isn't Stephen Moore's ("," op-ed, April 1), that anyone who works for the government isn't doing a good job or is overpaid. It's simply that the rest of us cannot afford their cost.</br></br>While one could point to numerous inefficiencies and inequities that a burdensome infrastructure imposes, the area that troubles me the most is the intrusion, frustration and waste inflicted by our regulators. The problem is that they think they have to do something to justify their existence by imposing their will or bias, or exhibiting a "them versus us" mentality.</br></br>Marshall Sterman</br></br>Swampscott, Mass.</br></br>Mr. Moore asserts that winning the future requires growing the part of the economy that makes things. Yet he acknowledges that falling employment in the "making" sectors of the economy is due in considerable measure to "hugely beneficial productivity improvements in such traditional industries as farming, manufacturing, financial services and telecommunications." How are we supposed to grow the part of the economy that makes things when it is shrinking because of its own success?
Investors fleeing jittery stock markets plowed money into the safety of government bonds yesterday, driving the prices of Treasurys higher and their yields lower.</br></br>Stocks dropped late in the day and investors moved to the Treasury market on renewed worries about the disappearance of easy credit and subprime-mortgage woes.</br></br>Many investors and traders are on vacation this week, and others are simply unwilling to trade anything but the safest fixed-income assets.</br></br>"It's actually quite quiet on the trading floor. You're not getting any screaming and yelling. At this point everyone's taking their hands off the wheel and watching the car skid," said T.J. Marta, a fixed- income strategist at RBC Capital Markets in New York.</br></br>Treasury bills and short-term Treasurys saw the heftiest gains as the flight to plain-vanilla investments picked up speed. The three- month Treasury bill yield fell to 4.395% yesterday as its price rose.
An estimated $10.95 billion was pulled from long-term mutual funds in the latest week, according to the Investment Company Institute.</br></br>The outflows came on declines in bond, hybrid and domestic-equities funds, offsetting gains in foreign-equities and municipal funds, the ICI said.</br></br>Despite some recent inflows of cash, the funds haven't yet come close to recovering from a six-week streak of steeper outflows, when investors retreated from a volatile stock market amid concerns about an uncertain economic outlook and worries about the debt load in the U.S. and Europe.</br></br>For the week ended Oct. 5, equity funds had outflows of $3.79 billion, compared with outflows of $6.59 billion in the prior week. Investors pulled $4.29 billion from U.S. equities and added $498 million to foreign funds.</br></br>Meanwhile, ICI reported bond funds had outflows of $5.8 billion, compared with prior-week inflows of $3.48 billion. Investors withdrew $6.24 billion from taxable funds, while flows into municipal funds totaled $444 million.
A fight is shaping up in Congress over whether the Treasury Department or the Securities and Exchange Commission should regulate the government securities market.</br></br>All parties agree that greater oversight is needed over the marketplace for U.S. Treasury and other non-mortgage-related government borrowings. These financial instruments make up the largest securities market in the world, with more than $113 billion in transactions a day, yet price information is hard to get and regulation is minimal compared with the markets where securities of private corporations trade.</br></br>Yesterday, Treasury officials sent legislation to Congress proposing that the department be primarily responsible for setting rules, including those regarding the dissemination of price information, for the government securities market. The proposed bill would make permanent the authority given temporarily to the Treasury in 1986 after investors lost money when several government securities dealers failed in the early 1980s. The temporary authority is set to expire Oct. 1.</br></br>But the House committee in charge of securities regulation is planning to release its own draft of proposed legislation that would make the SEC the primary rulemaker. The draft could be made public as early as next week, congressional sources said.</br></br>The subcommittee staff's proposal would be in line with the regulatory philosophy of Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) and Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), the members of the House with primary jurisdiction over setting securities regulation. They have advocated that government agencies regulate activities rather than industries.
President Fordï¿½Ûªs State of the Union I message really contains two separate I themes. The first is a proposal for a | tax cut, primarily for individuals, to | deal with economic recession and un-ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½i employment.

When it comes to default risk, U.S. Treasury securities are about the safest investments around. But default is not the only risk for bond investors. In the past 20 years, inflation has eaten away at these seemingly safe investments, often leaving bondholders with little but crumbs in the end.</br></br>Starting in January, the Treasury will offer 10-year "inflation protection notes" whose value is designed to rise with inflation, thus guaranteeing investors a "real" rate of return on their money.</br></br>Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin said the securities "offer Americans a way to save that fully protects their investments against inflation."</br></br>Treasury officials said the notes, modeled on inflation-indexed securities offered in Canada, will be sold in denominations of $1,000. The concept will likely be expanded to other maturities, perhaps up to 30 years, later in 1997.</br></br>Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax law, urged the Treasury to delay introducing the notes, which he said will make it harder for policymakers to predict what the government's future obligations will be.
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board added 175 stocks to the list of over-the-counter securities falling under the board's margin, or credit, rules.</br></br>The stocks include 149 securities added automatically because they have qualified for trading on the National Market System of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, and 26 more that otherwise met the board's criteria for listing.</br></br>The Fed also removed 20 stocks for failing to meet the listing requirements, and 33 others for such reasons as listing on a national securities exchange or being acquired by another company.</br></br>The Fed's new list of 2,406 stocks will take effect May 14. The Fed revises its over-the-counter list several times a year, and the next publication is scheduled for August.</br></br>Under the Fed's margin requirements, anyone buying a stock on credit must make a cash down payment, currently at least 50% of the stock's purchase price. The same rule applies to stocks listed on national exchanges.
FRANKFURT--European Central Bank President Mario Draghi opened the door to an escalation in the central bank's efforts to battle the debt crisis, hinting that the bank would be willing, under certain conditions, to intervene more forcefully in financial markets.</br></br>Mr. Draghi stopped short of promising unlimited purchases of euro-zone bonds, as a number of European policy makers have recently demanded, but his comments nevertheless signal that the ECB is willing to do more.</br></br>In his first appearance before the European Parliament since taking the ECB helm last month, Mr. Draghi offered a road map for policy makers and investors as Europe's debt crisis reaches a critical phase next week, when the ECB has its monthly meeting and European leaders hold another crisis summit.</br></br>His call to politicians: Enact tough new rules to punish fiscal rule-breakers and follow through on pledges to pursue deficit-cutting measures. Mr. Draghi signaled the ECB is willing to help, if governments deliver.</br></br>"He ruled out a swift type of approach, but at least he has told the markets if these two things are being done [by governments], then he won't let market confidence deteriorate too much. I thought it was quite well done," said Daniel Gros, director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.
CALGARY, Alberta -- Think Canadian natural gas will easily and cheaply cover a U.S. supply shortfall? Think again.</br></br>With U.S. gas producers finding it tough to boost output, Americans are looking north to help satisfy demand. Canada supplies about 16% of the natural-gas consumed by its southern neighbor, up from 11% in 1995. But with its own productive capacity peaking, Canada isn't likely to provide a sustained fix for U.S. gas consumers, specialists here caution.</br></br>That could lead to a supply crunch when a U.S. economic recovery takes hold. According to most analysts, U.S. demand for natural gas probably will expand steadily in the long term, due mainly to the fuel's increasing use in electricity generation, while domestic supply stays flat. Even in its latest short-term forecast for natural-gas demand -- revised to reflect economic fallout from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects domestic demand rebounding by 3.9% in 2002 after falling 2% this year.</br></br>To address anticipated demand growth, U.S. energy companies have been snapping up natural-gas companies and assets in Canada, made cheaper by low natural-gas prices and the strong U.S. dollar. In October, for example, Burlington Resources Inc., Houston, offered $2.1 billion for Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd., Calgary.</br></br>But doubts are growing about Canada's ability to keep boosting its gas exports in the long run.
Congress finally has figured out a way to cut the federal deficit. It's called paralysis. As long as Congress fails to boost the federal debt ceiling it will have the best of all possible worlds. It can appropriate funds to its heart's content, to subsidize farmers, Amtrak riders, subway builders, merchant seamen, doctors, lawyers, beggarmen, chiefs. But if the president can't borrow, he can spend only what the government takes in. So, in a process called "deferral" he simply tells a lot of constituencies, "We'll send you the money when we get it."</br></br>Compared with what we've had, it's not a bad way to run the government. In the process of deferring, the president must make economic choices, deciding, for example, whether it is more important to build a shopping center in Des Moines or protect the U.S. from nuclear attack. Any process that forces such choices represents progress -- a kind of shotgun item veto.</br></br>Congress has demonstrated once again this year that it cannot make economic choices on its own. The separate House and Senate "deficit-reduction" bills to be reconciled this week were properly described to the Associated Press by an anonymous OMB official as mostly phony, except of course for the new taxes. Appropriations bills currently under consideration by the two bodies, for agriculture, transportation, labor, health and education, are billions of dollars over budget. In forecasting federal spending, it is appropriations bills, not budget resolutions, that count.</br></br>So what "deficit reduction" really distills down to is an effort to wangle some new taxes. The Senate wants to introduce the equivalent of a European-style value added (VAT) tax into the American tax system, under the guise of a special levy to clean up "toxic wastes." It also wants to add a new import duty to finance "worker retraining" in the U.S.; since there has never been a huge demand for retraining under existing programs, it must be assumed that the main objectives are revenues and a little discreet protectionism.</br></br>As always, revenue enhancers have some guileful arguments. They say, for example, that just-released budget figures for fiscal 1985 demonstrate that the federal deficit expanded even in a time of economic recovery. The deficit did expand, to $211.9 billion from $185.3 billion the preceding year, and even though the recovery slowed sharply this year there was indeed a recovery of sorts.

Blanchard of Michigan and Richard L. Thornburgh of Pennsylvania, among others, told a Ways and Means subcommittee that they are in urgent need of relief from the interest charges on their unemployment trust fund debts. Pennsylvania owes the government $100 million ; in interest for its $1.1 billion loan from the fund this year alone, Thornburgh said. If the system is not changed, he added, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We estimate that Pennsylvania will have to pay more than $2.5 billion in interest on our federal loans by 1989.ï¿½Û</br></br>Michigan has borrowed $2.3 billion from the federal government since 1980 to maintain its jobless benefits, Blanchard said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our interest charges are currently $216,000 per day.ï¿½Û
The market for newly public companies is off the critical list, but it isn't exactly ready to run a marathon.</br></br>Earlier this spring, the market for initial public offerings was virtually on life support. April was the slowest month for newly public companies since January 1995: Only 30 new companies issued stock to the public, raising $1.6 billion, according to Securities Data Co.</br></br>By contrast, October, the busiest month in recent history, saw 105 companies raise $6.2 billion in initial offerings. Scores of issues that had been expected to price in April or May were postponed, either officially or unofficially, as underwriters hunkered down to wait until small-stock investors' eroding portfolios turned up and they were willing to look at new deals again.</br></br>That moment seemed to have finally arrived when the small-cap market started to heat up at the tail end of April and investors made headlines again on some hot deals. Now many underwriting firms have bulging pipelines, the result of months of prospecting for IPO candidates rather than executing deals. Securities Data reports that there are 184 deals awaiting execution, for $6.5 billion, a significant increase over earlier in the quarter.</br></br>But the enthusiasm may be premature. Unlike previous IPO rallies, many of the most talked-about recent deals have been the larger names, such as Hertz, the car-rental spinoff of Ford Motor. Hertz was priced in late April at $24 a share and closed Friday at $34 on the New York Stock Exchange.
U.S. stocks got another shot in the arm on Friday, closing out the week with a surge that put the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for the best September in 71 years.</br></br>The Dow leapt 197.84 points, or 1.9%, to 10860.26. The Dow rose 2.4% this week, extending its weekly win streak to four. The benchmark is up 8.4% this month, the best September since a 13.5% rise in 1939. Investors snapped up commodities and the euro, all signs of an increasing tolerance for riskier assets.</br></br>Gold set another record and briefly pierced $1,300 an ounce.</br></br>The day's advances began in Europe, after a strong German business sentiment survey helped reassure investors that the export giant's economic machine was humming. U.S. economic data a few hours later showed companies spending more, helping paint a picture of increasing corporate aggressiveness at a time when the global economy looks to be on the rise.</br></br>"That's what this market needed: solid signals that companies are spending their money, at a time when global demand is intact," said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. With the dollar weakening against most other currencies, she said, "that's supportive of export-driven companies."
The dollar surged, driven by near panic buying as surprised traders rushed to cover big bets that the currency would decline. The dollar was buoyed by optimism about the U.S.'s budget deficit and trade gap.</br></br>---</br></br>Rupert Murdoch, with the prospect of a $2 billion cash infusion from News Corp.'s partnership with MCI, is on the lookout for acquisitions, and may be studying big rivals such as Time Warner, TCI and Turner Broadcasting.</br></br>---</br></br>Hilton Hotels will spin off its casino holdings. Investors, who had hoped the company would find a buyer for both its hotel and gambling operations, drove its stock sharply lower.
NEW YORK, May 28 Ifflï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1The stock market was beaten down sharply today at the start of its fourth week of reaction, but a vigorous rally at the close marked the appearance of strong buying support.</br></br>Todayï¿½Ûªs drop was a part of the long slide that has retracted all but the final portion of the strong advance that started in mid-February and topped out in early April.</br></br>The reaction lias been founded in the spotty economic picture the Nation presents, especially lowered automobile production, the possibility of a strike in the steel industry, and a general tightening of money rates that has been going on for many months.</br></br>Prices were off 1 to around 8 points at their worst today, and at the finish the range of decline was 1 to around 5 points.</br></br>The market started higher in a modest sort of way, but it soon began to go lower without speed. Shortly after the start of the final hour, selling pressure intensified and forced the tape to lag in reporting sales. That ran its course shortly, and then the buyers took over with a great showing of spirit.
Americans are earning more money -- but socking it away and not spending, undermining hopes for a consumer-driven rebound.</br></br>The personal saving rate, which measures savings as a percentage of disposable income, jumped to 4.4% in June from 4% a month earlier and a recent low of 3.2% in November, the government said Tuesday, as consumers squirreled away cash amid the weak economy.</br></br>Spending on everything from vacations to clothes was largely flat in June. Spending fell less than 0.1%, after easing 0.1% in May, even though Americans' income after taxes rose 0.4%, the most since March. Consumer spending is the biggest single driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for roughly two-thirds of demand.</br></br>The pickup in saving is a two-edged sword for the economy. In the long run, saving helps Americans establish a cushion against financial setbacks and build up wealth that can fuel spending. It also helps them cope with rising gasoline and food prices. But penny-pinching sucks life out of the economy, which relies heavily on consumer spending and faces a dimming outlook as other drivers of growth lose steam.</br></br>"This is good news for the future, but it provides little help to the U.S. economy," said Eugenio Aleman, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities. "Individuals are hoarding cash to continue to build a protective layer in case the economy and their personal situation turns negative."
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cabinet approved legislation on Monday that would give Greece $29.6 billion over three years as part of a wider bailout, as the German government acknowledged that letting Greece go bankrupt could send the euro into a tailspin and hurt Germany's own economy.</br></br>"It doesn't only mean that we help Greece, but that we stabilize the euro as a whole, which helps people in Germany," said Merkel, who had been battered by critics for waiting to decide until Greek bonds were relegated to junk status last week.</br></br>The remark was a nod to the popular discontent in Europe's biggest economy about having to pay so much to rescue a fellow European Union country that many Germans feel has been fast and loose with its finances for years.</br></br>Both moves were mandatory after European governments and the International Monetary Fund agreed Sunday to give $145 billion in loans to Greece over three years. The loans came after Athens adopted a new round of austerity measures that provoked fresh uproar among Greek workers.</br></br>Germany would contribute $11.1 billion for this year, followed by $18.5 billion over 2011 and 2012. The money would come in the form of credit extended to Greece from KfW Development Bank, which is backed by the German government.
Consumer prices in the U.S. are barely rising, a boon to shoppers for everything from computers to clothing and a big reason that the Federal Reserve is willing to keep interest rates exceptionally low a while longer.</br></br>Because of a spurt in energy prices, the consumer-price index rose 0.2% in January and has climbed 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Labor Department said Friday.</br></br>But stripping out volatile food and energy prices, as policy makers do to gauge underlying trends, consumer prices actually fell by 0.1% in January, the first time that has happened since 1982. That so-called core-inflation measure was up a meager 1.6% in the past 12 months.</br></br>"There is just no inflation pressure in the U.S., so our focus has to be on growth and jobs," said William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, at an event Friday in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</br></br>The absence of inflation partly soothed market fears -- sparked Thursday by an increase in an interest rate that the Fed charges on emergency loans to banks -- that the Fed might be on the verge of raising other short-term interest rates, especially its benchmark federal funds rate.
NEW YORK, Aug. 30ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The stock market, apathetic as the Labor Day holiday approaches, eked out a slight gain today in sluggish trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 selected blue-chip industrials gained 3.16 to 957.86. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock index advanced 0.16 to</br></br>Advances barely outnumbered declines, 717 to 653, among the 1,746 issues crossing the tape. Turnover totaled 12,470,000, compared with the 12,300,000 traded Tuesday.</br></br>Prices were lower on the American Stock Exchange for the seventh session in a row, but the Over-the-Coun-ter market posted some small gains.</br></br>The Amex price-change index was off .02 to 26.59, the lowest since it touched the same figure last Jan. 26. Among the 1,162 issues traded, declines outpaced advances, 747 to 366. Volume was 3.13 million shares, down from 3.79 million Tuesday.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are taking pains to assure the public that if its key interest rate keeps dropping all the way to zero, there will still be plenty of ways to boost the economy.</br></br>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said the central bank can buy bonds, thereby driving down long-term interest rates. Yesterday, Fed Governor Ben Bernanke said if that didn't work, the Fed could lend directly to banks or help finance a tax cut.</br></br>Two weeks ago, the Fed cut its target for the federal-funds rate, charged on one-day loans between banks, to a 41-year low of 1.25%, from 1.75%. The move fueled talk that the central bank might be running out of ammunition in its fight to keep the economy growing, and spurred a related fear that inflation might give way to deflation, or generally declining prices. Since interest rates can't go below zero, deflation would cause the real, or price-adjusted, cost of borrowing to rise.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke said yesterday that with the funds rate at zero, the Fed would lose "its traditional means" of stimulating spending, but it "has most definitely not run out of ammunition."</br></br>It isn't assured that the steps Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Greenspan outlined would be effective if the U.S. were in a deep recession marked by deflation and the unwillingness of businesses and consumers to borrow at any interest rate.
Reacting strongly to persistent high inflation and the weak dollar, the Federal Reserve Board yesterday raised its discount rate to a record 8.5 percent.</br></br>It was the sixth increase this year in the rate the nationï¿½Ûªs central bank charges its member banks for loans.</br></br>Analysts said the increase signals further moves by the Federal Reserve to raise other interest rates in its fight against inflation.</br></br>The Fed action came as many of the nationï¿½Ûªs major banks were raising their prime rates to 10 percent. This is the interest they charge their best corporate borrowers for short-term loans.</br></br>It also came shortly after an unexpected spurt in food price inflation in September. Food prices, which rose sharply in the first six months of the year, nad declined in July and August.
NEW YORK, Jan. 29ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wall Street investors, worried by comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan that no new interest rate cuts are in the offing, sent stocks plummeting today after a midday rally of 27 points was cut short by a tumble in the Treasury bond market.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 47.18 points at 3224.96, its biggest fall since losing 120.31 points on Nov. 15. The blue-chip index closed at a record 3272.14 on Tuesday.</br></br>Losing stocks outpaced those that gained by nearly 2 to 1 on active volume of 249 million shares onthe New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that he expects the economy to pick up in the spring and that nothing needed to be done now to get the economy moving, either on the fiscal or the monetary policy front.</br></br>The bond market, higher early in the session as traders reacted favorably to President Bushï¿½Ûªs new budget and tax proposals, took a sudden turn for the worse after Greenspan began testifying.
Washington -- CONGRESS, RESPONDING TO the mutual-fund trading scandal, is revving plans into high gear for the most extensive new regulation of the fund business in more than 60 years.</br></br>At a hearing yesterday, the Senate Banking Committee discussed plans to introduce -- likely early next year -- broad legislation that could raise criminal penalties for rule violations, increase board controls and require more disclosure of fees. It also will consider creating a mutual-fund oversight board similar to the new accounting board Congress set up to oversee auditors in the wake of recent corporate accounting scandals.</br></br>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson, testifying at the hearing, acknowledged his agency was slow to spot and react to mutual-fund problems, and he pledged to speed up consideration of new SEC rules to strengthen investor protections, including steps that would inhibit market timing and effectively eliminate "late trading" of mutual-fund shares.</br></br>Meanwhile in the House, Rep. Michael Oxley (R., Ohio), chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said the full House is expected to vote today on a mutual-fund bill introduced by his panel. "He's confident he has the votes of two-thirds of the members," which is necessary to pass the legislation, said Peggy Peterson, Mr. Oxley's deputy staff director.</br></br>The bill had been stalled after passing the committee in July, but has gained momentum after state and federal regulators recently uncovered abuses. Passage of the bill is expected to spur the Senate to act on similar legislation to eliminate abusive trading practices in the $7 trillion fund industry. The House version would provide investors more fee information, strengthen director oversight of brokerage-fee arrangements and mandate that boards have two-thirds independent directors.
The Supreme Court yesterday overturned the fraud conviction of a New York City printer who used advance knowledge of five corporate takeover bids to make $30,000 in the stock market.</br></br>By a 6-3 vote, the justices ruled that Vincent F. Chiarella. a former employe of a Manhattan financial printing house, shouldnï¿½Ûªt have been prosecuted under the federal law used to convict him.</br></br>Chiarella, a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½markup manï¿½Û in the composing room of Pandick Press in 1975 and 1976, was convicted of using insider information to make his stock market killings. He was sentenced to one year in prison with 11 months suspended.</br></br>He was prosecuted under a federal securities law requiring corporate insiders to disclose their exclusive knowledge to the sellers of stock they buy.</br></br>But the nationï¿½Ûªs highest court said yesterday that Chiarella wasnï¿½Ûªt a corporate insider and therefore had no legal obligation to disclose his information.
Stocks ended mixed in trading that, by recent standards, was lethargic.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 6.48 points to 3215.12. But Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 0.77 to 405.21 and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.36 to 224.15. Advancing Big Board issues barely surpassed decliners, 884 to 852.</br></br>Volume fell to 160,620,000 shares on the Big Board from 185,040,000 Friday. Both days were relatively light compared with other sessions so far this year. At the end of February, average daily Big Board volume for 1991 was 233.17 million shares.</br></br>Some investors may have been unwilling to take positions ahead of today's "Super Tuesday" presidential primaries. But traders suggest that the light volume is also indicative of investors' ambivalence toward stocks while the economic recovery remains uncertain.</br></br>Traders said the stock market probably will remain lackluster until investors see evidence of an economic turnaround in the form of good corporate earnings. Firstquarter profit reports won't start pouring forth until mid-April.
Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank by asset size, agreed to buy Mexico's second-largest bank company for $12.5 billion in stock and cash, the companies announced yesterday.</br></br>Analysts said the purchase of Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival should strengthen Mexico's banking system.</br></br>The system is still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the 1994-95 peso devaluation and loan crisis that led to a $100 billion government bailout of debt-heavy banks, analysts said. The crisis caused many Mexicans to lose confidence in their banks.</br></br>Banamex owns Banco Nacional de Mexico, which has assets of $37 billion, nearly 1,300 branches across Mexico and 27 percent of the country's deposits, more than any other bank.</br></br>Citibank has had a bank in Mexico for more than 70 years, but recently its presence in Mexico has grown more visible, with an increasing number of automated teller machines and branches opening, especially in Mexico City. Citigroup will merge the company with its current banking operations.
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. offered a cautious outlook as it lowered its projections of a key profitability measure amid a slump in trading at the start of the year and boosted job-cut targets for its branches and mortgage business.</br></br>The reduced ambitions outlined Tuesday by Chief Executive James Dimon and others at the bank's annual investor day in New York show how J.P. Morgan's size and power across various markets hasn't made it immune to the struggles weighing down results at financial companies of all stripes. Executives across the banking industry, despite some early signs of loan growth, are wrestling with a sluggish U.S. economy and the effect of low interest rates on profits from lending, investing and trading.</br></br>J.P. Morgan executives said trading revenue had fallen 15% this year, due largely to a slump in trading activity in fixed-income markets. The bank lowered projections of a profitability measure known as return on tangible common equity to 15% to 16% for 2014, down from 16% in 2013.</br></br>Pressures on J.P. Morgan are acute in part because the bank has had to increase compliance costs. Tuesday, the bank said it would add 3,000 employees to compliance areas as it works to shore up relationships with the numerous regulators that oversee the bank's global operations. Executives said the 3,000 employees would be on top of the 7,000 additions to compliance in 2013.</br></br>The bank has agreed to more than $20 billion in settlements over the past year to resolve a number of government investigations and lawsuits, but it still faces a number of federal probes.
NEW YORK, April 3 (APIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Stock Market today rolled up its broadest trading record in history and its heaviest volume in more than five years.</br></br>Volume soared to 6 47 million shares, compared with 5.61 million last Thursday, the final trading day of the holiday-shortened week. The turnover was the biggest .since 7.72 million shares changed hands Sept. 26, 1955, on news of former President Eisenhower's heart attack.</br></br>Prices held to a mixed pattern throughout the day but American Telephone raced away from the pack, running up an advance of 9'b to a new all-time high of 130.

NEW YORK, Nov. 23 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market scored another big gain today on the heaviest trading in a month.</br></br>me advance surprised many market analysts who had looked for an irregular session immediately following the Thanksgiving holiday. A good number of Wall Streeters had taken today off to make it a four-day weekend.</br></br>Elements of strength were apparent from the start when the market, though a bit higher, was in its most doubtful stage of the day. As the session wore on, most of the kinks in the list were ironed out and the rise became fairly general.</br></br>Steels were pacemakers, three of their number placing among the list of 16 most active issues.

Author: Ian Talley; Tom Barkley</br></br>WASHINGTON--China appeared to be a net seller of U.S. Treasurys for the third month in a row during January, but remained the largest foreign holder, the Treasury Department said. Meanwhile, Japan continued its net buying of Treasurys, hitting another record.</br></br>Overall, foreigners were net buyers of long-term U.S. financial assets in January, according to the monthly Treasury International Capital report, known as TIC.</br></br>TIC data showed China slimmed its net holdings by $5.4 billion to $1.155 trillion in January, following net selling of $4.0 billion in December and $11 billion in November. The biggest owner of U.S. debt hit a record $1.175 trillion of holdings of U.S. Treasury securities in October. But China likely uses proxies in the U.K. and elsewhere to purchase Treasurys, making monthly TIC data an unreliable indicator of China's demand, many observers believe. The Treasury Department last month revised China's holdings of Treasurys upward by hundreds of billions of dollars, or nearly 30%, and cut the U.K.'s holdings by a similar amount.</br></br>Japan remained the second-largest foreign holder of Treasurys, boosting its holdings to $885.9 billion from $882.3 billion in December. Some in the market are concerned that, following a series of disasters beginning with Friday's earthquake, Japanese insurance companies will need to sell Treasurys to pay claims in the months ahead and that Japan's government will have less appetite for buying Treasurys. But Treasurys haven't been affected so far, and the ultimate impact of the disaster on U.S. government bonds is unclear.
NEW YORK -- The economy is recovering from an anemic second quarter, but its performance remains sluggish.</br></br>Spurred by a surge in consumer spending, economic growth picked up to a 2.3% annual rate this quarter, according to the results of a survey of economists by The Wall Street Journal. In the previous three months, the economy barely stayed afloat, with the gross national product expanding at a meager 0.6% pace, after adjusting for inflation.</br></br>The Commerce Department's initial estimate of third-quarter economic growth isn't scheduled for release until Oct. 21. Estimates of the 15 private economists polled by the Journal are similar to the government's "flash" projections, which were discontinued this year.</br></br>Although the economy's growth was slower than most economists had expected only a few months ago, analysts generally say the Federal Reserve System isn't likely to push short-term interest rates down further just yet. Several Fed officials recently have indicated that the central bank should hold policy stable for awhile to assess the effects of its previous credit-easing moves. These officials also have underscored the Fed's determination to keep inflation under control.</br></br>Some investors lately have become jittery about a recent spurt in commodity prices, especially gold, which they fear could be a harbinger of higher inflation. The Wall Street Journal survey showed that inflation increased only slightly during the third quarter. A GNP-based inflation measure, known as the deflator, rose at an annual rate of 2.7% this quarter from 1.8% the previous period, according to the poll.
LUMP-SUM PENSION payouts would lose tax benefits under Reagan's plan.</br></br>Certain sums received in one year are taxed now as if payment were spread equally over 10 years and the recipient had no other income ("10-year forward averaging"); a payment derived from pre-1974 membership in a retirement plan may be taxed at lower capital-gain rates. Unrealized gain on an employer's securities included in the payment isn't taxed until the recipient sells them; then it is capital gain. All these breaks would end under the Reagan plan.</br></br>Present law encourages early withdrawals for non-retirement uses, the Treasury complains, while the proposals would promote tax-favored distribution throughout a full retirement period. Taxes still could be deferred by "rolling over" a lump sum into an individual retirement account or other qualified plan, it says; and for someone who turns 55 by Jan. 1, 1987, the repeal would be phased in over six years.</br></br>This would take away "flexibility that always has been part of private retirement plans," Samuel Murray of Arthur Andersen & Co., CPAs, says.</br></br>STRICTER PENSION RULES would apply to premature and minimum payments.
NEW YORK, Aug. 18-Henry Kaufman changed his mind Tuesday, and the stock market posted its biggest gain ever.</br></br>Kaufman, chief economist at the investment firm of Salomon Brothers Inc., advised clients that interest rates are heading sharply lower over the next 12 months, ending years of pessimistic forecasts.</br></br>So gloomy have been the forecasts of Kaufman and another influential colleague, economist Albert Woj-nilower at First Boston Corp., that the two have been dubbed ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the bad news bearsï¿½Û of Wall Street.</br></br>reduced the risks of a flare-up in interest rates ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and the probability of later and lasting declines has been enhanced,ï¿½Û he said.</br></br>Then on Tuesday, reports circulated on Wall Street that Kaufman also had changed his stance. First the bond market staged an explosive rally. Then stock trading opened, and a buying binge took off, gaining momentum as Salomon Brothers confirmed the new forecast. At the close of trading Tuesday, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks had soared a record 38.81 points.
They're slipped under dorm-room doors, strewed down stairwells and scattered to the winds that blow across the District's campuses. Like autumn leaves, they crackle underfoot in multicolored heaps on college lawns and sidewalks, each with its own alluring message:</br></br>The latest advertising technique for city bars and nightclubs has turned into a major headache for officials at some colleges. Discouraged by anti-solicitation policies banning handing out or posting fliers on college campuses, some event promoters have taken to simply dumping hundreds in one spot, then moving along quickly.</br></br>"They drop them in the quad as if, 'Whoops! Dropped them!' " said Elana Nightingale, a sophomore at American University, which has been hit hard by the scatter phenomenon.</br></br>Recently, Nightingale saw someone open a high window on campus and release a stack of fliers into a stiff breeze.</br></br>University officials are frustrated by the eyesore caused by the handbills as well as the potential hazard--some of the ads are on slick, glossy paper that they fear could send pedestrians sprawling. Most annoying, though, is what officials see as a subtle appeal to underage drinkers.

Thru trading moderated and opening prices were shaded.</br></br>The remainder of the session was rather quiet as ihe best gains melted away and the li.-l remained barely ahead. When it was apparent the market was not yielding ground easily, buyer*, returned in I lie final hour and prices went to their best of the day in brisk turnover.</br></br>Analysts said that the ability of the market to hold after the initial rise instead of sliding abruptly as it has done on some recent occasions was encouraging to traders who saw it as a sign of fundamental strength.
The White House says the recession is over, and the anecdotal evidence suggests a recovery has begun. The lackluster response in financial markets, however, suggests widespread doubts that policy makers in Washington have a clue about how to sustain a recovery.</br></br>Specifically, markets have to be wondering about the delay in reappointing Alan Greenspan as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bush announced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made no announcement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies and kibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to "leverage" the Fed to ease interest rates further.</br></br>This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urged Mr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession. Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, these advisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and the Fed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, but also probably dangerous; financial markets can see when stones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.</br></br>Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. official who has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amid the capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer the economy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results. The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which are the decisive rates for investment. It's done this without reigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fed tenure, has been the expectation before every presidential election cycle.</br></br>It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed can easily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate the fed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this, dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30.
Republican gubernatorial candidate Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. said today that Maryland could raise as much as $400 million a year by legalizing slot machines at three horse tracks and that he would devote most of that money to improving public education.</br></br>Ehrlich's comments came in sharp contrast to the position of Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who has staunchly opposed expanding legal gambling options to erase a projected $900 million revenue shortfall next year. Instead, Townsend proposes to help balance the budget through freezing most state spending.</br></br>Ehrlich, in addition to endorsing slot machines, said he would need to chop 4 percent off the budgets of most state agencies, capture more federal funds and raise some state fees.</br></br>The gaming issue surfaced again as a key political rift between the two candidates today, just as Maryland's largest gaming venues, its horse tracks, were undergoing a major transition. The owner of Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park, the state's two premier thoroughbred racetracks, announced that he would be selling control of his company to a Canadian entertainment firm.</br></br>Owner Joseph A. De Francis said the sale would further "galvanize" the debate over legalizing slot machines in Maryland. "We have the opportunity to bring our policy leaders the perspective of an international company that has operations in three countries and over a dozen states."
WASHINGTON -- Rising energy costs pushed U.S. consumer prices higher last month, though the increase was partly offset by tame prices for housing and discretionary-spending items.</br></br>The data should provide some comfort to Federal Reserve officials that high oil and commodity prices and the weak dollar aren't leading to higher underlying inflation.</br></br>The consumer-price index rose 0.3% in October, the Labor Department said, matching September's increase. The so-called core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, advanced 0.2% for a fifth straight month. Unrounded, core CPI increased 0.159%.</br></br>In a separate report, the Labor Department said the average weekly earnings of U.S. workers, adjusted for inflation, fell 0.2% in October, as wages failed to keep up with inflation.</br></br>Consumer prices in October were up 3.5% from a year earlier. Core CPI was up 2.2%. The gap between the two inflation measures could widen as higher energy prices keep pushing up overall inflation while softness in housing and auto prices keep underlying inflation in check.
SOMETHING STRANGE HAS been going on in the bond market, and, so far at least, it has been great news for stocks.</br></br>As the Federal Reserve has continued to raise short-term interest rates, longer-term government-bond yields haven't followed suit. They have fallen back to levels that some experts didn't expect to see again in their lifetimes.</br></br>After declining for two months, the yield of the 10-year Treasury note was at a paltry 4.08% Friday, well below the 4.6% level at which it stood when the Fed started raising short-term rates a year ago. Prime lending rates, pegged to the Fed rates, are up. But fixed mortgage rates and some corporate borrowing rates, which are pegged to bond yields, are at or below year-ago levels.</br></br>For a few stock investors, this conundrum, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has called it, is bad news, because it could presage a weak economy.</br></br>But the prevailing view in the stock market is one of celebration. Many stock investors believe falling bond yields are predicting some good news indeed: low inflation, moderate economic growth and an end soon to the Fed's rate increases. That kind of "Goldilocks" economy, not too hot or too cold, would be fine for stocks.
RICHARD KLEIN remembers his first puff only vaguely: he was 12, and sneaked around the corner at school with some friends. His last is equally indistinct: It was a couple of years ago in a bar in Paris. He smoked about half of the single cigarette he had been carrying around, and decided not to finish the rest. The decades in between were filled with packs of Marlboros and Gitanes, too many to count. "You never smoke just one cigarette," says the 53-year-old professor of French at Cornell. "It's always connected to the one that came before and the one that will come after."</br></br>The decisive moment for Klein came in his mid-thirties, as he watched his body start to decline. "I was making efforts to exercise, and discovered the effects smoking had on that. I realized I had to do something about this habit, and for the next 10 years began to struggle manfully." He also began to read Kant, in particular The Critique of Judgment and his theories about the sublime.</br></br>The addiction, the struggle against it and the philosopher came together to produce Cigarettes Are Sublime, an elegant and erudite examination of the question: If cigarettes are so bad, why do so many people insist on smoking them? "There is nowhere in the world," the author notes, "where people do not smoke if they are allowed to do so."</br></br>A cigarette offers what Kant terms a "negative pleasure": an intimation of infinity, a safe glimpse into the void. "Warning smokers or neophytes of the dangers entices them more powerfully to the edge of the abyss, where, like travelers in a Swiss landscape, they can be thrilled by the subtle grandeur of the perspectives on mortality opened by the little terrors in every puff," Klein writes. "Cigarettes are bad. That is why they are good - not good, not beautiful, but sublime."</br></br>Quoting the book out of context - cigarettes, according to one passage, are "one of America's proudest contributions to the world" - can make it seem like Klein is secretly employed by the tobacco companies. Actually, he makes clear upfront that he's stopped smoking, is glad of it, and isn't trying to encourage anyone else. After all, his whole point is that smokers don't need much encouragement.
Treasury bonds wrapped up a sixth straight weekly price gain, extending the run to the longest winning streak since June 2011.</br></br>Prices strengthened as the latest data showed the U.S. economy hit a soft patch during the first quarter. The sixth weekly decline in the 10-year yield, which moves inversely to its price, underscores how optimism over the U.S. economy earlier this year has shifted to anxiety about the strength of the recovery.</br></br>The 10-year yield, a benchmark for long-term U.S. consumer and corporate borrowing rates, has tumbled from 2.399% in March and now trades less than 0.30 percentage point from a historic low set in September.</br></br>"Technicals are slightly bearish for Treasurys because of low yields but the economic data [are] waning and the situation in Europe is deteriorating further," said Ian Lyngen, senior government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group LLC.</br></br>Late Friday in New York, the 10-year note rose 8/32 point, to 100 20/32, to yield 1.931%, compared with 1.959% late Thursday. The yield has edged down from 1.966% at the end of last week and has dropped 0.37 percentage point over the past six weeks. The 30-year bond gained 13/32 point, to 100 6/32, to yield 3.116%.

Author: Moshe A. Milevsky</br></br>Sit back for a moment and ponder something unpleasant: How would a large, sustained drop in the stock market affect your personal finances? More specifically, imagine the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting 6500--its March 2009 level--and staying there.</br></br>I suspect that most of you are thinking about the wretched blow this would deal to your retirement savings and stock portfolio. And it no doubt would. But here's my advice: Think more broadly. Most important, think about how such a drop would affect your paycheck and your career.</br></br>It will depend on the person, of course. Earnings in some professions are tightly linked to the stock market--an investment banker, say, or portfolio manager or financial adviser--while others, such as hospital nurses or tenured professors, are relatively immune to these zigs and zags. Most people will fall somewhere in between.</br></br>Consider this an exercise in personal risk management. It isn't intended to gauge whether you believe the stock market will test those levels again, and I'm not asking whether you are bullish or bearish. That is not what personal risk management is about, even if it is how most people practice it. The issue here is: If the bear returns for a prolonged visit, regardless of your subjective view of these odds, how would it affect your current and future earning power? And--more important--are you properly considering it when creating your investment portfolio?
Japan's stock and currency markets dealt the world's No. 2 economy a heavy blow Friday. The yen surged, battering shares of Japan's top exporters as the country nears recession.</br></br>In Tokyo, the yen reached a 13-year high against even the rising U.S. dollar. In late afternoon trading Friday in New York, the euro was at 119.05 yen, a six-year low and down sharply from 125.12 yen Thursday. The dollar was at 94.6 yen.</br></br>A strong yen wreaks havoc on Japan's export-driven economy, eroding the value of Japanese companies' overseas earnings, and often making the price of those products more expensive in overseas markets. After seeing sales to U.S. and Europe fall, exporters have been hit again as sales to the emerging markets have started to falter.</br></br>Some experts warn that the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, which dropped 9.6% Friday, will tumble even further next week if Japanese exporters disappoint investors with poor results and outlooks, as the rising currency may lead many to do.</br></br>For Japan, the rising yen and falling stock market come at a particularly delicate time. Gross domestic product shrank in the April-June quarter and most economists are expecting it to contract again in quarter that ended Sept. 30, which would qualify as a recession.
You read it here first: The Federal Reserve will not lower interest rates when its policy committee meets Sept. 18.</br></br>That's not to say it couldn't lower rates before Sept. 18 if financial markets experience another meltdown or if there is credible evidence of a dramatic slowdown in the overall economy. Or any time after Sept. 18, for that matter.</br></br>But it ought to be clear to anyone who has been listening to Bernanke & Co. that the last thing they want to do on Sept. 18 is be seen as giving in to the pleading of overpaid traders, bankers and fund managers desperate not to confront the consequences of their own mistakes.</br></br>In truth, it probably doesn't matter what the Fed does on Sept. 18. It was not primarily the Fed that created the credit bubble -- it was the traders, investment bankers and fund managers, working through unregulated global financial markets. And now that all that market-created credit and liquidity has suddenly disappeared, there is little the Fed can do to replace it, even if it wanted to. Which it doesn't.</br></br>You don't have to agree with everything French President Nicolas Sarkozy said to an employer group last week to admire the boldness and clarity of his economic vision.
During the campaign, Jimmy Carter spoke on practically every subject in. this world, and a few in the next. But notï¿½ï¿½ï¿½at least not in a systematic way-on inflation.</br></br>The major speech prepared on inflation was never given, and an eight-point program based on the speech and' released on the campaign plane was almost universally ignored. So it is not surprising that businessmen are nervous and there is a tendency to see a collision shaping up between the President-elect and the sagacious chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Arthur Burns.</br></br>But in fact an analysis of the original speech shows that Carter takes the inflationary problem seriously indeed. It seems equally clear that Mr. Burns, far from seeking a shoot-out with the new administration, is moving toward a position of accommodation.</br></br>The basic premise of the original speech prepared for Carter is that inflation is a deadly serious problem. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Curbing the disease of inflation will be one of the biggest challenges facing the next President of the United States,ï¿½Û is its opening line. The speech further says: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Inflation has been a national disaster. It has deprived the American peo-, pie and, indeed, the whole world of the</br></br>reliance on the soundness of the dollar that is so vital to our economic system. ,'It has destroyed the value of hard-earned pay increases... forced people to... lower their standard of living... defrauded the small saver... imposed a huge human toll." The slow-growth policy of the Ford administration for dealing with inflation was, of course, rejected because it cost so much in unemployment and underused productive capacity. Instead, the speech proposed an eight-point program for dealing directly with inflation in a way that would not diminish employment or slow down economic growth. The eight points were as follows:
The Federal Reserve, concerned that the economy's sluggish growth could signal a possible recession, yesterday cut short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point -- its first move to lower rates in nearly three years.</br></br>The dramatic turn in interest rate policy was announced by the Fed's top policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee. It said it would cut the federal funds rate, the interest rate financial institutions charge on overnight loans to each other, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent.</br></br>Several banks immediately said they would follow the Fed's lead and reduce their 9 percent prime lending rate to 8.75 percent, effective today. The reduction will benefit many small-business borrowers and consumers with home equity loans and credit card balances, whose rates typically are tied to the prime.</br></br>The Fed's announcement had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street, following weeks of speculation about how the Fed would react to signs that the economy was weakening. Both stock and bond markets surged after the 2:15 p.m. announcement, with the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 industrial stocks gaining 48.77 points to close at a record high of 4664.00.</br></br>The Fed's move to cut rates yesterday ended a cycle of tightening that began in February 1994. Over the next 12 months, the Fed raised short-term rates seven times, lifting the federal funds rates from 3 percent to 6 percent, in what Fed officials said was an effort to slow economic growth before it triggered a surge of inflation.
WHEN STOCKS FROM otherwise healthy companies pay out more than their bond brethren, at least in terms of certain ratios, investors can benefit from that rare lapse in logic.</br></br>At issue are companies whose stock dividends carry higher yields than the same companies' bonds. An investor who buys those stocks and shorts the bonds stands to make a quick profit. Such a strategy played in 2004 would have returned 10% versus a 9% return by the S&P 500, according to Goldman Sachs.</br></br>"It's an inefficiency, because the market values different securities of the same issuer in a way that doesn't make sense from an economic perspective," says David Kostin, a Goldman portfolio strategist. "An asset with higher growth potential theoretically should offer less current yield than a similar asset with lower growth potential."</br></br>And that's usually how it works. The growth of a stock dividend is expressed as a percentage yield gleaned by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current market price. Companies that can afford to pay dividends on their stocks tend to see their stock prices rise over time, and the rising share price lowers the dividend yield unless the dividend payment rises dramatically.</br></br>But 15 companies identified by Mr. Kostin and a colleague, Robert Koyfman, in a report earlier this month have average dividend yields of 3.8%, while their bond yields, adjusted for inflation, average 2.4%.
INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT leveled off in July, indicating that the economy continues to stumble. Factory production slipped 0.1% and utility output fell 0.4%, but mining posted a 1% gain. The nation's industrial operating rate fell to 83.4% of capacity, down from 83.6% in June, which could temper some of the inflation pressure stemming from higher oil prices.</br></br>Cutting U.S. dependence on foreign oil by up to 550,000 barrels a day is envisioned under a Bush strategy calling for voluntary conservation and higher domestic output. The plan would replace much of the crude the U.S. imported from Iraq and Kuwait.</br></br>---</br></br>Stock and bond prices closed slightly higher after Bush damped early optimism about a possible resolution with Iraq. The Dow Jones industrials rose half a point to close at 2748.27. The dollar ended mixed.</br></br>---
DECLINING INTEREST RATES PROVIDED a great opportunity for homeowners to lower their monthly debt payments by refinancing about $1 trillion worth of mortgages over the past two years. Each time rates dipped, applications for refinancing soared, according to an index from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which uses the week ended March 16,1990, as a base of 100. When rates stabilized or ticked upward, applications fell. With rates now going up, analysts say refinancings will no longer be a factor supporting consumer spending.</br></br>Millions of American homeowners seized a golden opportunity to repair their tattered finances over the past two years as falling interest rates allowed them to lower their monthly home mortgage payments by refinancing their mortgages. About $1 trillion worth of home mortgage loans were refinanced during that time.</br></br>And millions of home buyers benefited when they bought homes and secured mortgages with rates much lower than those on their old houses.</br></br>Many economists say that refinancings are an important way in which consumers can free up cash by lowering their monthly payments, turning some of their equity into cash and perhaps paying off other debts that carry higher interest rates than mortgages. The benefits from the lower paymentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½or in some cases paying off the mortgage fasterï¿½ï¿½ï¿½will continue for years to come.</br></br>But as the chart at the right shows, the upward surge in mortgage rates in the last few months is choking off the refinancing opportunity for most homeowners who have not already acted. Mortgage lenders around the country report that mortgage applications for refinancings have dried up, while those for purchasing a home have stayed at a high level.
On a windblown field, 300 leathery men listened Saturday to speeches praising their past bravery in battle and their current contribution to peace. Behind them, standing in soldierly rows, were rocket launchers, artillery and machine guns the former fighters were reluctantly surrendering to international peacekeepers.</br></br>Ten miles away, two dozen farmers watched sullenly from the edge of a neatly planted plot as a squad of government eradicators, wielding hoes and scythes, chopped down their carefully tended opium poppy shoots. On all sides, Afghan police and security guards hired by the U.S. Embassy stood watch against attack.</br></br>"The government has taken away our guns, and now it is destroying our livelihoods," protested Nasir Ahmad, 45, a sunburned farmer in the village of Kote Ashro. "We have agreed to turn in our weapons in the name of peace, but we don't have enough water to grow any other crops but poppy. Why are they bringing this cruelty on us now?"</br></br>By most standards, Wardak province should be a model for the rest of Afghanistan. It is the only place in the country where militia disarmament, poppy eradication and voter registration -- three efforts backed by the United Nations and Western governments - - are taking place simultaneously.</br></br>But some residents say they feel this ruggedly beautiful, impoverished province is less a showcase than a victim. They complain that it has been singled out for unpopular projects demanded by international powers because it is close to Kabul, economically vulnerable and without a dominant leader to resist the pressure.
Kayak Software Corp. slowed its march to the stock market in one of the clearest examples yet of the fallout from Facebook Inc.'s tumultuous initial public offering.</br></br>Kayak, which runs a travel-listings website, didn't launch its "roadshow" to pitch the stock to large investors, an event that had been expected to begin around Memorial Day, people familiar with the matter said. Morgan Stanley, the lead bank on the Facebook deal, also is leading the Kayak deal. With Facebook proving a disappointment for many investors, timing for the Kayak deal is uncertain now, the people said, adding that the company is assessing investors' current appetite for Internet stock deals.</br></br>"We're waiting for market conditions to meet our requirements" for an IPO, said Kayak spokeswoman Jessica Casano-Antonellis on Wednesday. She said the IPO hasn't been delayed because the company never set a time frame for its offering.</br></br>As the first significant Internet IPO expected after Facebook's debut nearly two weeks ago, Kayak was shaping up as a big test both of the IPO market and of Morgan Stanley, which has endured criticism that it overestimated demand for Facebook shares.</br></br>On Wednesday, the shares fell another 2.25% to $28.19, leaving them down more than 25% from their IPO price of $38.
THE MERGERS TRAIN just keeps rolling along. The past three months of mergers and acquisitions produced the most active period since the end of 2000, with corporations and investors putting down $665.9 billion for deals around the world, 53% more than the year-earlier period.</br></br>From utilities and cable television to banks and real estate, companies showed they wouldn't shy away from doing deals even amid a lackluster stock market. If earnings improve and cash continues to pile up on corporate balance sheets, the next six months stand to produce a similar stream of deals, say the bankers and lawyers who put the transactions together. Still, there probably will be few blockbusters, such as the one announced yesterday: Bank of America's roughly $35 billion purchase of MBNA Corp. Instead, expect a procession of announcements driven by these M&A stalwarts: cost- cutting and modest geographic expansion.</br></br>"Boards are still cautious," says Boon Sim, head of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, at Credit Suisse First Boston. "I don't think there are any 'concept' deals out there. The market is still pretty disciplined, and that trend will continue for the rest of the year."</br></br>Still, activity in the second quarter picked up by nearly every measure. In the U.S. alone, the amount spent on deals surged 73%, compared with the second quarter of 2004, and rose 20% from this year's first quarter. Private-equity firms continued their march into the fray, accounting for 17% of global M&A activity, a sharp increase from 11% last year, according to data from Thomson Financial.</br></br>Through the first-half of this year, the dollar volume of global deals involving retailers surged 137% according to data firm Dealogic, while oil and gas deals also leapt 137%, and technology rose 60%.
MORTGAGE BROKERS, prepare your resumes. And while you are at it, highlight any experience you've had in health care.</br></br>The reason: Housing, the biggest generator of jobs in the current expansion, is running out of steam. As a result, tens of thousands of Americans, from bankers to hardware-store clerks, are likely to find themselves out of work over the next couple of years. For those who can transfer their skills to other industries that are still growing, such as health care, it won't be the end of the world.</br></br>"It's not going to be a big show-stopper, because there are other areas of the economy that are picking up," says Brian Bethune, U.S. economist at consulting firm Global Insight.</br></br>Few sectors can claim to have as much sway over the economy as housing. Housing-related employment has accounted for about 23% of the 4.9 million jobs created since the nation's job market began to grow in late 2003, according to Moody's Economy.com. That includes architects, contractors, real-estate agents, brokers and bankers, as well as the host of others who provide the industry with materials and services.</br></br>"There's never been a housing boom like this one in terms of the reach, in terms of the range of industries affected," says Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. "This is clearly unprecedented."
NEW YORK -- Expect rising interest rates this spring as the economy expands at a brisk pace.</br></br>That's the message from a growing number of economists and investment managers amid concern about rapid money-supply growth recently. Some predict the Federal Reserve System will tighten its credit grip within the next few months in an effort to restrain the money supply and remind investors of its determination to combat inflation.</br></br>Strong economic growth will encourage businesses and consumers to increase their borrowing, adding to pressures for higher rates, analysts say. "I expect rates to move up over the next few months because demands for credit will increase as the economy strengthens and because the Fed probably will find it necessary to become more restrictive," says Leif H. Olsen, who heads Citicorp Information Services, a unit of Citicorp.</br></br>This view attracted more supporters last week after Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, outlined the central bank's money-supply and economic forecasts at a Senate Banking Committee session. Although Mr. Volcker didn't make any forecasts about interest rates or Fed credit policy, many Fed-watchers interpreted his remarks to mean that the board eventually will adopt a tougher credit policy. Other Fed officials have declined to elaborate. Mr. Volcker is scheduled to testify again tomorrow at a House Banking subcommittee hearing.</br></br>"Market jitters about the Fed's intentions are likely to contribute to further near-term increases in both short- and long-term interest rates," said Henry Kaufman, chief economist of Salomon Brothers Inc. In the latest issue of his weekly publication, "Comments on Credit," Mr. Kaufman predicts that the federal funds rate "will drift up toward 9% before the end of March." The funds rate, which is the rate on reserves that banks lend one another overnight, has been hovering around 8 1/2% recently.
A recession means higher unemployment, but it also means something else, according to a new study: a nationwide increase in the filing of employment discrimination cases.</br></br>A preliminary draft of a study by the American Bar Foundation shows that in the two decades between 1969 and 1989, the volume of such suits in federal courts rose by an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½astonishing 2,200 percent, nearly 10 times faster than all other federal civil lawsuits.ï¿½Û</br></br>The study found that within that period, employment discrimination suits rose when unemployment increased and eased when joblessness fell.</br></br>a Thereï¿½Ûªs been a "dramatic" shift to cases charging discrimination in firing from those charging discrimination in hiring, a In addition to the economy, state fair-employment laws and anti-discrimination agencies also influence the volume of litigation in federal courts.</br></br>100,000	suits filed in the 20-year period, with specific analysis of 1,250 cases filed in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, New Orleans,
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. and South Korea agreed on a plan to lift the Asian nation's ban on American beef exports, removing a major impediment to action in Congress on a free-trade deal with South Korea, though significant hurdles remain.</br></br>The agreement came amid South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's first formal visit to Washington since taking office two months ago and was the result of a furious round of negotiations this week among trade officials for both countries. Seizing on the breakthrough, the White House vowed to press anew for action on the landmark trade deal.</br></br>U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said the new protocol providing for renewal of beef trade will take effect in mid-May and will allow for "a full reopening of the market." Under the agreement, all U.S. beef and beef products from cattle of all ages will be allowed to be exported to South Korea. Before the ban, South Korea was the third-biggest importer of U.S. beef, buying $790 million worth in 2003. Since then, it has relied on Australia as its main supplier.</br></br>For cattle ranchers and beef producers, the reopening of the South Korean beef market "is a very good shot in the arm," said feedlot operator J.D. Alexander, based in Pilger, Neb. American beef producers are struggling to remain profitable as prices for corn feed and fuel continue to soar, causing cattle ranchers to liquidate their herds at a rapid clip to keep costs under control.</br></br>Gregg Doud, chief economist at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, says South Korea's market could become the top beef customer for the U.S., potentially amounting to $1 billion annually.
WASHINGTON -- Weak payroll growth and declining unemployment suggest that the U.S. job market is growing at a slow but steady pace.</br></br>Employers added a disappointing 110,000 jobs in March, the fewest since July and a big decline from 243,000 in February, the Labor Department reported. Meanwhile, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate fell to 5.2% in March from 5.4% in February.</br></br>Economists believe that last month's lackluster performance in payroll growth is an indication of businesses turning more cautious in the face of profit pressures and another spike in energy prices.</br></br>Separately, the Commerce Department reported that construction spending increased 0.4% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.05 trillion. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management, which polls purchasing agents at more than 400 industrial companies, said its index of manufacturing activity was relatively unchanged at 55.2 in March. The new-orders index ticked higher to 57.1 from 55.8, while the employment gauge slipped to 53.3 from 57.4.</br></br>Index readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding. The March number represents the 22nd consecutive month of manufacturing growth.
Top finance officials from rich and developing countries agreed Saturday to curb hefty bonuses for bankers, but the proposed crackdown on high payouts fell short of European demands after the United States and Britain shied away from imposing a cap.</br></br>The Group of 20 finance ministers also pledged to maintain stimulus measures such as low interest rates and additional government spending to bolster the global economy, warning that the fledgling recovery that provided the backdrop to their meeting here is by no means assured.</br></br>"The financial system is showing signs of repair," U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said. "Growth is now underway. However, we still face significant challenges ahead." The G-20 joint statement issued at the end of the ministers' London meeting said that fiscal and monetary policy will stay "expansionary" for as long as needed to reduce the chances of a double-dip recession.</br></br>The International Monetary Fund has said that the global economy is beginning a sluggish recovery from its worst recession since World War II, and in July it raised its estimate for global economic growth in 2010 to 2.5 percent, from an April projection of 1.9 percent.</br></br>But the IMF also downgraded its forecast for this year, saying the global economy would shrink by 1.4 percent instead of 1.3 percent.
Six months after Washington rescued Wall Street, exasperated banks insist they want to leave the lifeboat.</br></br>Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, said yesterday that he regrets accepting $25 billion in federal aid. He called the money "a scarlet letter," pledged quick repayment and renounced further borrowing from the government, saying, "We've learned our lesson about that."</br></br>But the company, which announced a $2.1 billion first-quarter profit yesterday, has not entirely had it with Washington. J.P. Morgan said it plans to continue using a separate federal aid program through which it has borrowed more than $40 billion.</br></br>Other large banks are attempting the same combination of breakup and embrace. Even as they clamor to exit the most prominent part of the bailout program by repaying government investments, firms continue to rely on other federal programs to raise even larger amounts of money.</br></br>The Treasury Department so far has invested slightly less than $200 billion in banks. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has helped companies, including J.P. Morgan, borrow more than $336 billion through the end of March, by guaranteeing to repay investors if the firms defaulted. And financial firms hold more than $1 trillion in emergency loans from the Federal Reserve.

At any given time, thousands of federal workers are on official travel. Many are visiting Washington on business even as feds from here are checking up on field offices, attending conferences or conducting business somewhere else.</br></br>Here's a tip for anyone who expects to be sent out of town on or about Oct. 1, the start of the new fiscal year and the time when nonessential operations may be shut down for lack of a federal budget agreement.</br></br>To avoid being sleepless in Seattle, down-and-out in Ottawa or buffaloed in Buffalo, check to see if you are an "excepted" employee before you get on an airplane.</br></br>In the event of a shutdown, federal workers will be designated one of two things: excepted or nonexcepted.</br></br>Excepted types would keep working -- because of the essential nature of their jobs -- and would be paid once their agency budgets are approved. Agencies have until Sept. 6 to decide which functions are essential and which employees get the excepted designation.
MADRID -- With more than $100 billion of deals proposed in the past two years, Europe's giant utilities have one of the world's biggest cases of merger mania. Just yesterday two European companies culminated a messy battle and agreed to a $58.27 billion bid for Spain's Endesa SA.</br></br>Behind all the deals is a big collision between Europe's new push for a unified marketplace and the national pride of Europe's politicians. Starting July 1, the European Union's power sector will be officially flung open to competition, allowing utility companies from any of the bloc's 27 member nations to sell electricity in any other.</br></br>By unshackling the energy sector, European regulators hoped to boost competition and lay the foundation for stronger growth on the continent. They wanted to inject the continent's electricity marketplace with new players that would spur cheaper energy prices.</br></br>But that vision has bumped up against a messy reality: Politicians in European capitals are reluctant to loosen their grip on the state- run national champions that dominate strategic sectors. Rather than invest in new capacity, transmission lines and other upgrades, the dominant players have instead been bulking up for a wave of mergers.</br></br>Big utilities are scrambling to buy up assets from Bulgaria to Scotland in a mad dash to get bigger when the deregulatory rules come into full effect. Last year, Paris rushed a merger between French utility Suez SA and Gaz de France SA, though the pact has hit legal and political hurdles and the outcome is unclear. Earlier this year, two midsize power companies in the Netherlands, Essent NV and Nuon NV, said they would tie the knot. Spain's Iberdrola SA will complete its $24 billion friendly takeover of Scottish Power PLC in the United Kingdom this month, making it the world's biggest marketer of renewable energy sources such as wind power.
Home prices posted another modest rise in August, according to data released Tuesday, but economists cautioned that the expiration of a home-buyer tax credit and rising unemployment could reverse signs of stabilization in the housing market.</br></br>In 20 large metropolitan cities, home prices rose 1 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in August compared with the previous month, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index. That was the third month-over-month increase in the closely watched index.</br></br>Prices are still falling compared with a year ago, down 11.3 percent in August, and are off 30.2 percent from their peak in 2006, hovering at 2003 levels, according to the index.</br></br>But bolstered by historically low interest rates, cheap foreclosure properties and the $8,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, prices are falling at a slower rate and the monthly increase reflects stabilization, economists said.</br></br>"It's a sign that there is a bottom in sight," said Cameron Findlay, chief economist for LendingTree.com, an online mortgage company. It bodes well, he said, for "stabilization of home prices."
NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mostly higher after being whipsawed both before and after the Federal Reserve said it was leaving interest rates unchanged, while shifting to a more balanced view of the risks facing the economy.</br></br>At 4 p.m., the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 4/32 point, or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, at 96 29/32. Its yield fell to 5.279% from 5.296% Monday, as yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The 30-year Treasury bond, the weakest maturity, was unchanged from Monday at 95 1/32 to yield 5.728%.</br></br>Treasurys had been lower for most of the session. But the market rallied after the Fed's decision to keep the federal-funds rate at 1.75% was announced at 2:19 p.m. EST.</br></br>In a statement, the central bank said that "against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and the information currently available, the risks are balanced with respect to the prospects of both goals." But the Fed also sounded a note of caution about future activity, mentioning that the outlook for final demand -- seen as the linchpin for a sustainable recovery -- remains unclear.
Is there any truth to the image of telecommuters as pajama-clad, unshaven workers who get easily distracted by child care, personal telephone calls or housework?</br></br>Probably not, according to AT&T Corp., which tracked its employees' telework patterns for the past 10 years. In fact, the company's surveys show that its teleworkers are more productive than those who work in an office.</br></br>Most large companies today have at least a few people who telecommute from home, if not on a daily basis, then with some sort of regularity. With longer commutes, child-care issues, a global economy and, of course, much better technology, it only makes sense to allow workers to work from home at times.</br></br>About 90 percent of AT&T's management employees work from home at least some of the time, while 30 percent of them work completely from home. Other workers have the ability to spend days at home on an as-needed basis.</br></br>But with our new world of widespread telecommuters come growing pains. Telecommuting mistakes can cost companies money, productivity and employee morale, according to AT&T. Its own "casual" study of worst practices (that's such a nice change from all the best- practices research out there) found that companies don't trust employees to be productive, said Cathy Martine, senior vice president of Internet telephony at AT&T. Companies also face problems in that teleworkers miss face-to-face contact. But those companies that don't permit teleworking fall flat during weather or other disasters, when employees could have worked from home, even if they could not travel to the office.
A sentence in Hobart Rowen's column in the Sunday Business section should have read: "According to (oil expert Eliyahu) Kanovsky, the Saudis won't wait until their monetary reserves are totally exhausted before raising oil production." (Published 7/13/87)</br></br>Since OPEC announced last August that it intended to resume its old tactic of holding back oil production, prices have staged a solid recovery, jumping to $21 per barrel on a spot market basis here from less than $10 per barrel at the low point just a year ago.</br></br>At that time, the now-deposed Saudi oil minister, Sheik Zaki Yamani, was counseling a strategy of flooding the markets with Middle East oil, his theory being that non-OPEC producers would be forced out of business and that, ultimately, OPEC could resume monopoly-based higher pricing.</br></br>It didn't work, whereupon Yamani was fired. OPEC members then set a price target of $18 a barrel, cut their output about 20 percent in the final months of last year, and agreed on a further 7 percent reduction for the first quarter of 1987, with a ceiling of 15.8 million barrels a day.</br></br>According to Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., the cartel members overall kept surprisingly close to their agreed quotas. Notably, the Saudis came in under quota in February and March, offsetting excess production by Iraq and some others.

Anticipation was strong for Facebook Inc.'s initial public offering as the Nasdaq Stock Market indicated shares would start trading under the stock symbol FB around 11 a.m. EDT Friday.</br></br>Facebook's IPO could be a "nice shot in the arm" for brokerages, said Sean Kelly, a managing director with brokerage Knight Capital Group. "We're expecting a big day" for volume, he said, adding he hoped the deal would spark enthusiasm for stocks among individual investors.</br></br>On Thursday afternoon, financial advisers at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney learned their allocation of Facebook shares for clients would be 5,000 per account, according to people familiar with the matter.</br></br>The nearly 17,200 brokers at the retail brokerage joint venture were notified of the number Thursday afternoon, these people said. The new amount though, is flexible as clients with more than one account could receive more than 5,000 shares, one of the people said.</br></br>Traders at T3 Trading Group LLC were set to huddle in their Lower Manhattan office before the opening bell to discuss trading strategies for Facebook. The firm says it has been honing its tactics this year as other social-media companies made their trading debuts.
The recession, most economists agree, is over. So why are some of America's biggest companies, like Du Pont Co., Digital Equipment Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co., planning to lay off thousands of workers?</br></br>These contradictory signals about where the economy is headed have caused some head scratching -- and some second-guessing about the nascent recovery.</br></br>"Corporate executives and macro-economists are on different planets at this point," says Robert Reich, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Who's right? Inevitably, it's the executives. What they anticipate becomes self-fulfilling -- they'll make the key decisions about borrowing, investment, cost-cutting, everything."</br></br>Even if the economy avoids slipping back into recession, the recovery will be historically lethargic, many now say, with gross national product growing at about 3% rather than the customary 6% annual growth for post-World War II recoveries. Adds Richard Belous, senior economist at the National Planning Association, a research group representing business and labor: "When you go sector by sector, it starts looking like we may have another dip down into recession or a recovery so sluggish it's indiscernible."</br></br>Not so quick, responds Richard Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Absolutely, we are in a recovery. We bottomed out in April and gains will continue with no double dip," he contends. "I don't find the evidence of layoffs startling as some do. Unpleasant, maybe, but not startling."
"We're going to pay a little visit to our friends," said activist Will Ward yesterday afternoon, seconds before a busload of protesters chanting, "Criminal offender, predatory lender," descended on the Silver Spring branch of Wells Fargo Financial.</br></br>Angry, shouting people soon filled the office, including an 11- year-old girl wearing a foam shark suit.</br></br>The demonstration, led by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, was one in a series of rallies nationwide this week to protest what the group considers exploitative lending practices of San Francisco-based Wells Fargo & Co., the nation's largest provider of mortgage loans.</br></br>Members of ACORN, a nonprofit community advocacy group that has chapters in 51 cities, also stopped at the Federal Reserve's headquarters and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington to voice their concerns.</br></br>ACORN claims Wells Fargo fails to provide sufficient lending services in low-income and minority communities and that Wells Fargo Financial and Wells Fargo Funding, separate units of the company, charge excessive fees and interest rates to borrowers with poor credit histories.
PRAGUE -- After five months in office, International Monetary Fund chief Horst Koehler has begun to win over many of those who wondered whether he was up to leading the global lender through a period of public excoriation and internal reform.</br></br>As thousands of antiglobalization protesters laid siege to the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank here yesterday, Mr. Koehler laid out his vision for the agency responsible for rushing in with big loans and stern advice when a developing nation finds itself in financial crisis. The IMF, Mr. Koehler told top officials from 182 member nations, must "make globalization work for the benefit of all."</br></br>His effort to focus the IMF on emergency loans for better-off developing countries, and on poverty reduction and debt relief for the worst-off, won't convince the IMF's harshest critics, who believe its economic prescriptions favor corporations over the poor and the environment. But his approach is securing him the grudging cooperation of some outside activists and "so far, so good" kudos from member governments, large and small.</br></br>The Clinton administration likes his embrace of many of Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers's reform proposals. The British praise his ability to talk debt relief with antipoverty advocates. The Yemenis applaud when he prods rich countries to open their markets to exports from the developing world.</br></br>These aren't necessarily the reviews that Mr. Koehler, 57 years old, might have expected. His appointment came after a bitter trans-Atlantic clash. Now, however, Clinton administration officials are warming to Mr. Koehler, who has endorsed many of the IMF reform proposals that Mr. Summers himself first put forth, such as the focus on crisis finance. Just last week the IMF board redesigned its lending programs -- shorter terms and higher rates -- to encourage countries such as Brazil, Egypt and Indonesia to borrow only when they're locked out of private capital markets. Preapproved credit lines are available to countries whose economic policies are judged sound but that might still be hit by contagious market panic.

Thereï¿½Ûªs the theory that blames it all on federal deficits. Another view holds that inflation is all diie to mismanagement of the money supply. A third attributes it to OPEC and oil prices.	' -"All of those things have contributed to inflation fjrom time to time over the years. None of them is the single crucial source of the trouble. The technical economic analyses never quite reach the heart of the matter. At its present stage, the inflation is rooted mainly in public attitudes. Not only the government but Americans throughout the country want better performance out of the economy than it is capable of giving. They want lower employment and better housing and bigger pensions and faster growth, simultaneously, than the great machine can provide.</br></br>Living in, a highly organized society, Americans have become skilled at protecting themselves from inflation. The cost of living has risen 10 percent in the past year, and people think it only fair that their incomes should go up 10 percent to compensate them. To the extent that people succeed in recapturing that 10 percent, it will turn up again in the months ahead in somebody elseï¿½Ûªs costs and the inflation will continue.</br></br>"To keep the inflation rate at zero, every rising price has to be balanced by a falling price somewhere else.</br></br>When any worker manages to push his wages up faster than his productivity, some other workerï¿½Ûªs wage has to fall. But most American producers have a ratchet on their prices, and wage cuts are almost unknown. President Carterï¿½Ûªs wage and price guidelines are a brave attempt to hold everybody to increases that are a little below the inflation rate, to distribute the burden as widely as possible. While the guidelines are better than nothing, they are hardly proving a miracle.

The Agriculture Department trimmed its estimate of the wheat harvest under way across the Southern Plains to account for drought damage, but recent rains have improved crop conditions in much of the Midwest.</br></br>The department's June crop report, released Friday, predicted a 1.62 billion-bushel winter-wheat harvest, down 2% from the May forecast and down 5% from last year's actual harvest of 1.7 billion bushels.</br></br>The damage isn't enough to fuel any acceleration in the nation's mild level of food-price inflation. U.S. wheat prices are depressed. Several of the U.S.'s wheat-exporting rivals, such as Australia and Canada, are sitting on large stockpiles in the wake of several good growing seasons.</br></br>As a result, the Agriculture Department didn't change its forecast that the price of a bushel of U.S. wheat will average about $2.65 this year, give or take 25 cents. Many farmers can't make a profit at that price.</br></br>Winter wheat, the biggest variety grown in the U.S., is planted in the fall and harvested in late spring. The wheat fields in the worst shape are located in Texas, where 59% of the crop is in very poor to poor condition, according to a government survey released a week ago.
Correction: The headline on an Oct. 20 A-section article about possible support in the Obama administration for a deal last year to protect Bank of America from losses incurred by its purchase of Merrill Lynch said "Bank of America deal had White House support" without citing the source of that assertion. It should have attributed the information to internal Bank of America documents. (Published 10/21/2009)</br></br>Top economic advisers to President Obama signed off on a deal to protect Bank of America from losses incurred by its purchase of failed Wall Street firm Merrill Lynch a month before the new administration took office, according to Bank of America documents.</br></br>The documents, describing internal discussions at the bank in late 2008, assert that executives were told that incoming National Economic Council Director Lawrence H. Summers and incoming Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had endorsed the deal to provide new guarantees to Bank of America.</br></br>The acquisition has been a source of protracted debate since earlier this year, when questions arose about whether federal officials exerted an inappropriate amount of pressure on Bank of America to complete the deal. There's also been debate about whether the bank made appropriate disclosures to its shareholders about losses at Merrill Lynch, its negotiations with the government for additional support and compensation plans at Merrill Lynch.</br></br>These issues have been the subject of investigations by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York's attorney general.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Late blue-chip buying rescued the stock market averages from serious declines but prices still closed lower in sluggish trading today on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The Dow .Jones industrial average, close to 6 points lower much of the day. finished 2.04 lower at .910.14, following a 14.22-point tumble Wednesday.

Home-equity loans and lines of credit are still a popular way for homeowners with a mortgage to borrow. The interest is much lower than on other forms of consumer borrowing and, generally, interest you pay on loans up to $100,000 is tax-deductible.</br></br>In the past few years, with housing prices soaring nationwide and short-term interest rates at or near record lows, many homeowners have used the equity in their houses to finance home improvements or college tuition or to pay off high-interest debt.</br></br>But times are changing. Interest rates on short-term home-equity lines of credit have spiked even as the housing market is slowing, which means that homeowners will have less of a cushion to fall back on should they be unable to repay borrowed money.</br></br>A home-equity line of credit charging 4 percent two years ago is now over 7.5 percent and is expected to hit 8 percent by the summer, said Greg McBride, a senior analyst at Bankrate.com, which tracks loans. That's because a line of credit, the most popular way to borrow against home equity, is a variable-rate loan and rates have gone up as the Federal Reserve has increased its benchmark rate.</br></br>Still, home-equity loans and lines of credit are often the most attractive option for homeowners looking to borrow, and traditional cash-out refinancing of first mortgages has fallen out of fashion since rates began to rise.
The quality of public debate on economic issues is rapidly degenerating to the level of intellectual barbarism. Contradiction has become the mark of sophistication, evidence is dismissed as irrelevant, and "experts" are defined as anyone who advised the government during some economic catastrophe. Indolent journalists lean on an imaginary consensus, claiming that "most economists agree" about this or "Wall Street worries" about that.</br></br>Most economists are said to be concerned that a growing economy must raise interest rates, which will prevent the economy from growing. The solution, it seems, is for the Fed to raise interest rates to slow the economy, so that interest rates can fall and thus speed up economic growth.</br></br>Mainstream economists are reported to agree that a strong dollar causes trade deficits, and trade deficits make the dollar weak. The Fed therefore has to raise short-term interest rates to attract long-term foreign investment, or else the absence of foreign investment might raise interest rates. If foreigners keep investing in U.S. factories, on the other hand, most economists fear the U.S. will become a "net debtor" rather than a net lender (to Latin America and East Europe). The solution is to attract and repel foreign capital.</br></br>Most economists apparently believe that all countries should export more than they import, and can do that by periodically devaluing their currencies against each other. Exports are the benefit from trade, and imports are the cost. Inexpensive foreign goods make us poorer. The U.S. should try to raise import prices and cheapen exports, so that we can give up more wheat for less oil.</br></br>Most economists did not approve of the falling dollar of 1978-79, or the rising dollar of 1981-83. But most of all they do not like a stable dollar. The dollar must be free to float, but it always floats to the wrong level. Most economists agree that the dollar is overvalued 30%, and in danger of falling, but monetary authorities must ignore exchange rates and prices.

Retailers call the period between Dec. 1 and the last weekend before Christmas the "Dead Zone." Sales typically slow between the Thanksgiving-weekend crush and the right-before-Christmas panic, and shoppers procrastinate endlessly. But this year, the Dead Zone is more lifeless than ever.</br></br>Traffic at department stores slid close to 5% last week from a year ago, and mall sales fell 6.9%, despite a hefty bout of promotional sales. Worried about keeping Internet shoppers engaged and spending, online retailer Amazon.com Inc. extended its free November shipping offer on orders over $100 into December, a move designed to lure customers into purchasing before the last minute. Even giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said its sales were running below plan for the week after Thanksgiving at both its namesake discount stores and its Sam's Clubs division.</br></br>With the stock market shaky and mounting signs of an economic slowdown, the midseason lull is making retailers particularly edgy this year. Despite a selling sweep on a handful of unexpectedly popular toys, most economists are predicting that holiday sales will be lukewarm, at best, this Christmas. And one big fear is lurking in many retailers' minds: that a last minute snowstorm will keep some shoppers from resuming their shopping spree on Dec. 23.</br></br>Such jitters are exacerbated by the fact that Christmas this year falls on a Monday, giving procrastinators the luxury of an entire weekend to whisk down Main Street or pop over to the mall and scoop up items, many on sale, at the last minute. Except for the odd, annoying relative who finishes holiday shopping in October, most Americans tend to put it off to the very last minute: Over the last decade, the busiest shopping day of the year has shifted from the day after Thanksgiving to the Saturday before Christmas.</br></br>Hopes of a late rush are of little comfort to retailers whose stores right now are full of merchandise but short on holiday shoppers. "It is looking very painful, and it feels painful to look at the numbers now, if you don't realize what the calendar is doing," says Beryl Raff, chief executive of Zale Corp., who adds that she expects a surge of traffic the weekend before Christmas. "The reality is that this is a Christmas that can't be read until December 25."
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 16 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Extension of the income tax surcharge beyond its expiration date next summer will not adversely affect consumer spending, economists at the University of Michigan were told Friday.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Most consumers either do not know that Congress made the tax increase a temporary measure, or believe that the surtax will be extended,ï¿½Û said Prof. George Katona, an economist and psychologist at the university.</br></br>Katona recalled that when the tax went into effect last summer it did not have a dampening effect hoped for because it came at a time when large wage increases were frequent and when expectations of further wage increases were strong.</br></br>There was some slowing of consumer demand in anticipation of the boost, he noted, bul it was quickly overcome after the tax became a reality since the additional payments were only small extra deductions from weekly paychecks.</br></br>Now, consumers have become accustomed to the tax and still are optimistic over future salary boosts, the economist said. Abandonment of the surtax, however, will have an expansionary effect on spending, Katona said.
NEW YORK -- This week's economic data, which will shed more light on the much-discussed slowdown, may also bring some better trade figures.</br></br>October reports on industrial production and capacity utilization, due out tomorrow, are expected to show declines -- a move suggested in the recent October jobs data.</br></br>The report on October retail sales, also due out tomorrow, is expected to show a slide from the previous month. And Wednesday's data on September manufacturing inventories could show some declines from August levels.</br></br>The September trade deficit, due out Thursday, is thought to have contracted from August's $10.8 billion. The consensus view calls for a $9 billion deficit for September, according to MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York.</br></br>Last week, the Federal Reserve eased credit in what many economists saw as an effort to temper the slowdown that has been the number-one topic among economists for weeks. "This is one of those few times when people have a unanimous view that we're on a slow-growth track," said Michael Moran, economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., New York. But the debate continues on whether the economy is sliding toward recession.
The Senate last night overwhelmingly voted in favor of U,S. acquisition of two destroyers that the Navy never asked for until recently. The 62-to-26 vote could add $700 million to the federal deficit this year.</br></br>The issue under consideration was. whether the United States should pay Litton Industries the $700 million to acquire the two ships, originally ordered by the shah of Iran. The new. Iranian government has canceled the-order, leaving Littonï¿½Ûªs Ingalls Ship-' building Division with four partially completed destroyers that do not meet U.S. Navy specifications.</br></br>In the Budget Committee several weeks ago, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.' (D-Mich.) moved to eliminate from the Senate budget resolution $1.35. billion for the United States to acquire the ships. The motion carried, but due to a mistake or a mixup, the budget resolution reached the floor with money for two destroyers still included.</br></br>Riegle pleaded with his colleagues yesterday to eliminate that money. Approval of the $700 million would be "the most powerful symbolic message that comes out of the 1980 budget process,ï¿½Û Riegle said, warning that the public would be outraged when it realized how the United States was bailing out Litton.</br></br>But Riegle was up against one of the last of the Senateï¿½Ûªs powerful southern committee chairmen, John C. Stcnnis (D-Miss.l. Stennis chairs the Armed Services Committee, which has voted to acquire the lour Spruance-class destroyers, which are
Thermidor, the name of the month in the French Revolutionary Calendar in which Robespierre fell and the Reign of Terror ended, has become the name by which historians denote an era of waning revolutionary ardor. Conservative critics of the 104th Congress complain that it went directly from the ancien regime to Thermidor, without any intervening revolution.</br></br>The deflation of their aspirations is symbolized by Newt Gingrich brandishing buckets in which ice had been delivered to congressional offices since before the invention of refrigeration. The Commerce and Education departments may not be finished, but ice deliveries are, so there.</br></br>Some depressed conservatives -- one of them calls the 104th "the Bush administration in drag" -- may think that the end of the 104th was in its beginning, in its opening day hoopla, which included, among much else, a children's party featuring the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Newt Gingrich. Back then it was hard to have any Washington gathering of two or more without having the speaker speak, and at the children's party he stuffed into the wee minds this explanation of the event's Larger Meaning: "We wanted the Power Rangers here because they're multiethnic role models in which women and men play equally strong roles."</br></br>There has been too much blather, much of it from Gingrich, who has paid dearly for his refusal to heed the advice given to him -- early and often -- that he ration the portions of himself that he serves to the public. Still, measuring the 104th against history rather than its own rhetoric, it was a remarkably consequential Congress.</br></br>Intelligent people differ concerning the prudence of the 104th's most important act -- repeal of a 60-year-old entitlement to welfare. But the repeal ranks with the 1981 tax cuts, Medicare, the 1964 and 1965 Civil Rights Acts and the Taft-Hartley Act as one of the most momentous legislative acts of the past six decades.
WAYNE, N.J. -- GAF Corp. said its independent directors endorsed an increased, $53-a-share cash and debt offer by Samuel Heyman, GAF chairman, to take the company private.</br></br>Mr. Heyman's bid, $2 a share more than his most recent offer and valued at a total of $1.47 billion, caps a 13-month-long effort to get GAF's outside directors to agree to a buy-out.</br></br>Mr. Heyman, who won control of the specialty chemical and building material concern in a bitter proxy fight in 1983, will still need the approval of a majority of shareholders. Analysts said they doubted that would pose a problem.</br></br>Mr. Heyman owns 10% of GAF's 27.8 million shares, and institutions own slightly more than 40%. A shareholder meeting will be scheduled when the Securities and Exchange Commission completes its review of GAF's proxy materials. The review is expected to be completed soon.</br></br>Terms of the offer call for holders to receive $46 in cash and junior subordinated debentures intended to have a value of at least $7 a share.
Where do we go from way up here?</br></br>Some investors get vertigo peering down from the lofty height of Dow 10000.</br></br>But to the standard-bearer of the bull market, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. strategist Abby Joseph Cohen, the horizon looks clear for further gains.</br></br>"This is an economy that is doing quite well and we think will support an increase in stock prices," says Ms. Cohen, who marked Dow 10000 sipping tea in her office. "But we don't think that the increase in stock prices will be at the same high rate. We are still quite bullish, but we aren't quite as exuberantly bullish."</br></br>She says stocks have the green light unless government, corporations and individuals stop making the "sensible decisions" that have transformed the economy.
In reviewing the U.S. Treasury bond market in 1991, one cannot help but be impressed by the steep decline in interest rates and by the volume of actual financing.</br></br>We are all aware of the weakness that permeated the economy and how the Federal Reserve responded to that weakness during the year. Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½administeredï¿½Û ratesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the discount rate and the federal funds rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which the Fed directly controls.</br></br>As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.</br></br>However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.</br></br>Another feature of last yearï¿½Ûªs market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates. True, the anemic economy and the Fed helped a great deal, but when one considers the volume of financing, it is quite incredible.
For much of the last half-decade, the story line for Southern Maryland's economy has been simple: Growth, and how to manage it. People have flocked to the region, creating fertile ground for companies of every sort.</br></br>Now, add this line to the story: There are scores of new jobs, but with unemployment rates nearing the lowest level in decades, it can take time to fill them.</br></br>Southern Maryland's roaring economy has significantly intensified demand for workers, fostering a climate in which prospective employees in some industries can command higher salaries or move to another job.</br></br>"People all over are having these problems. It's real," said Janet Cook, executive director of St. Mary's County's Chamber of Commerce, which recently lost an office manager to a better-paying job at a high-tech firm.</br></br>The Southern Maryland experience so far relects that of the larger region. While much of the nation is braced for job layoffs as the economy slows, the deep reliance of metropolitan Washington's economy on the federal government appears so far to have shielded it from most of the fallout of any downturn, experts say.
WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose 0.7% in July while sales fell 0.5%, the Commerce Department reported, another indication that the economy is vulnerable to recession.</br></br>Economists have been watching inventory levels closely, fearing that if stockpiles of unsold goods grow too high, businesses will cut back on orders and production. With the economy barely growing, the chain reaction could lead to a recession.</br></br>July's rise in inventories followed a 0.5% decline in June.</br></br>The figures "are not worrisome in themselves, but taken with other data seen of late they suggest we are dealing with an economy that is fragile," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co., Chicago, pointing to recent declines in retail sales and housing starts and an increase in the unemployment rate.</br></br>Aubrey Zaffuto, vice president and economist at IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co., New York, predicted there will be a cut in production to offset the growing inventory figures. "People are intolerant of small increases in inventories," she said.

All in all, stock prices went up more in January 1987 than they did in some previous years.</br></br>What about this January, the month just concluded? It wasn't thrilling. The stock market puffed along the tracks like the Little Train That Couldn't. The Dow started the year by going up for four straight days, gaming a total of 113 points. On the fifth day, it fell 140 points, giving back all it had gained and more. And all this was happening at the 1900 to 2000 levelsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½about where the Dow-had been a year ago.</br></br>When January trading ended Friday, the Dow stood at 1958.22. only about 20 points above where it started the year.

Barack Obama is asking Americans to gamble that the U.S. economy can be taxed into prosperity. That's the message of his campaign for the Buffett Rule, which raises income-tax rates on millionaires to a minimum of 30%, and for the expiration of the Bush tax cuts. He wants to raise the highest income tax rate by 20%, double the rate on capital gains, add a new 3.8% tax on all capital earnings, and nearly triple the dividend tax rate.</br></br>All this will enhance "economic efficiency," insists a White House economic report. As for those who disagree, says President Obama, they're just pushing "the same version of trickle-down economics tried for much of the last century. . . . But prosperity sure didn't trickle down."</br></br>Mr. Obama needs a refresher course on the 1920s, 1960s, 1980s and even the 1990s, when government spending and taxes fell and employment and incomes grew rapidly.</br></br>But if the president wants to see fresher evidence of how taxes matter, he can look to what's happening in the 50 states. In our new report "Rich States, Poor States," prepared for the American Legislative Exchange Council, we compare the economic performance of states with no income tax to that of states with high rates. It's like comparing Hong Kong with Greece or King Kong with fleas.</br></br>Every year for the past 40, the states without income taxes had faster output growth (measured on a decadal basis) than the states with the highest income taxes. In 1980, for example, there were 10 zero-income-tax states. Over the decade leading up to 1980, those states grew 32.3 percentage points faster than the 10 states with the highest tax rates. Job growth was also much higher in the zero-tax states. The states with the nine highest income tax rates had no net job growth at all, and seven of those nine managed to lose jobs.
What is the best advice for investors worried about rising interest rates? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report.

It depends on your portfolio and your risk tolerance. The market behavior of recent weeks should have provided clues as to which of your investments are most at risk if market rates rise further.
NEW YORK, Aug. 2 OPIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rail shares rallied late Today, inspiring a slack stock market to produce enough gainers to make the pattern irregular instead of lower.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The upsurge by rails in the closing minutes was the drily outstanding feature in a session which was the slowest since Mar. 25 and.the narrowest since Mar. 22.</br></br>The tardy recovery was enough to put the list of pivotal stocks ahead on average but it was tooTate to change the fact that there were more losers than gainers among all listed stocks.</br></br>The carriers went ahead as conviction spread in Wall Street that the Interstate Commerce Commission was about ready to give the railroads their requested freight rate increase. There was talk, too, that the rails would ask for more of the same ' after the new inci-ease is granted.</br></br>Aside from this group action it was a dull performance. Nonferrous metals were dampened by ' Defense Mobilizer Gordon Grayï¿½Ûªs statement that the Government will stop buying lead and zinc for the Nationï¿½Ûªs strategic stockpile. Aircrafts and chemicals were generally lower. Rubber shares were improved as prices for rubber products moved upward. Motors were mixed. Steels shaded.
Propelled suddenly upward by as much as 50 percent in December's record-breaking cold wave, prices have receded rapidly after a mild January and balmy February in much of the Northeast. Wholesale prices are back to where they were in November. Retail prices have declined less quickly, but are well below late December levels.</br></br>In the wake of the rapid price movements, several federal, congressional and state investigations are still trying to determine whether the surge was engineered by the oil industry to increase profits, but the U.S. Energy Information Administration has concluded that it was a predictable response to a sudden very large increase in demand.</br></br>"In the face of extraordinary and unexpected increases in demand," EIA said in a recent report to Congress, "petroleum markets performed as might have been expected: The distribution system responded to temporary imbalances in supply and demand through higher prices, which were quickly followed by increased supplies and declining prices, approaching those of last November."</br></br>In the Washington area, where the price of home-delivered fuel oil soared from less than $1 per gallon to nearly $1.40 between Nov. 1 and Christmas, Steuart Petroleum Co. quoted a price of $1.149 this week. Another major distributor, A.P. Woodson Co., was charging $1.069.</br></br>"Prices have come down faster than anyone believed they would," said Philip R. Chisholm, executive vice president of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America. "Retail prices would have come down faster, except that during the last week in December {when stocks had been depleted and wholesale prices were soaring}, a lot of distributors built inventory at very high prices. Then the sudden surge of warm weather left that expensive oil in the inventory through the first week of December." "I think it's over," John Lichtblau, director of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said of the heating oil crunch. "Prices collapsed in January just as they soared in December. There was a buildup of inventory and suddenly nobody wanted the oil."
In all the hundreds of books, articles and speeches on American competitiveness -- or the lack thereof -- work rules and job restrictions are rarely mentioned. Such rules forbid a foreman to do any production work, whether taking the place of a worker who goes to the restroom, repairing a tool or helping when the work falls behind. They forbid electricians to straighten a stud when installing a fuse box. They forbid workers' moving from one job to another, thus restricting them to narrow, repetitive tasks, e.g. spray-painting the door panel of a car. And they narrowly restrict what a worker may be trained for. Yet all available evidence indicates that work rules and job restrictions are the main cause of the "productivity gap" of American (and European) manufacturing industry.</br></br>To be sure, productivity is not the sum of competitiveness. But when it comes to making things, productivity is the foundation. And it is precisely those American and European industries in which making things is most hedged in by work rules and job restrictions -- steel, automobiles, consumer electronics, rubber and so on -- that have done the poorest against the competitors from East Asia.</br></br>The best evidence for the effect of work rules and job restrictions is found in America's building industry. It alone of all major industries anywhere has -- working side by side -- union shops with tight job restrictions and non-union shops without them. Both shops are often owned by the same company -- it's called "double-breasting" in the industry -- with the same people running them. The time it takes to do an individual job, e.g. connecting a drain pipe, is exactly the same in both. Yet the crew working under work rules and job restrictions needs two-thirds more people to do the same job in the same time.</br></br>A "double-breasted" contractor recently ran a study on two nearly identical projects done by his company, one by a union crew, the other by a non-union crew. The non-union crew worked an average of 50 minutes out of every hour. The union crew worked 35; the rest of the time it was forced to wait -- for someone to come back from the restroom or for a journeyman to become available to do work an apprentice could easily have done but was not allowed to touch. The unionized crew also had to work short-handed for 40 minutes until a man qualified to drive a truck had come back from the shop with a replacement part. When that happened on the non-union project, the foreman ran the errand and the work continued.</br></br>The result: The unionized crew required a crew of eight, the non-union job was done by five workers. Interestingly, the large Japanese contractors who are considered models of efficiency work with roughly the same productivity, all observers agree, as American non-union contractors.
Though the IPO window appears closed to all but a select few companies, that hasn't stopped an optimistic breed of start-ups from pinning their dreams on going public.</br></br>Their initial public offerings aren't underwritten by investment banks, they price their stock for $1 a share or less, and they are hoping to sell enough to eventually list on the OTC Bulletin Board. Although they span a wide variety of industries, from mining to technology, they have a lot in common: no revenue and, in most cases, no product or operating business.</br></br>Some own land they seek to explore or develop. Others have product prototypes they want to manufacture and distribute. All are willing to give the public markets a shot at a time when only two mature companies have gone public in the past six months.</br></br>"You put it out there, and whatever comes back, comes back. But my ideal would be to have one investor with deep pockets" buy all the shares and become a long-term partner, said Trevor Blank, chief executive of Skyhigh Resources Inc., which registered in October to raise $25,000.</br></br>The company, which incorporated nearly two years ago, has no revenue but owns a 1,200-acre property in Canada that it wants to explore for gold, silver and platinum. Its cash balance, according to its prospectus: "nil."
Stocks were mixed in volatile trading as blue-chip issues, falling victim once again to investor worries about interest rates, ended a two-day rally. Technology stocks managed a slim advance.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 156.68 to close at 10,561.41, wiping out more than half of the past two sessions' 292- point gain.</br></br>Broader indicators were mixed. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock fell index 14.38, to 1387.67, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 6.88, to 4427.65.</br></br>American Express led the Dow lower, tumbling 5-9/32, to 153-27/ 32, as investors guessed it would be among the stocks to suffer if the Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates to force a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In an effort to keep inflation under control, the Fed has raised rates four times since last June.</br></br>"The U.S. economy doesn't seem to be slowing down at all," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock & Co. in New York. "Stocks continue to climb a wall of worry over higher interest rates."
Nelson Bunker Hunt and his brother. W. Herbert, told congressional committees yesterday they are three-quarters of a billion dollars in debt as a result of their silver speculating spree, but they don't know yet whether they made or lost money on the deal.</br></br>The Hunts testified they may be able to minimize their losses with the help of a $1 billion bailout loan from a group of banks, arranged with the blessing of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker.</br></br>The loan will let the brothers keep their millions of ounces of silver, rather then force them to sell it now. Selling the silver immediately could drive down prices, causing heavy</br></br>Nelson Bunker Hunt testified he has silver speculation debts of about $350 million and W. Herbert said his obligations come to about $400 million.</br></br>Bunker and Herbertï¿½Ûªs debts are so great that they are getting financial help from their brother Lamar, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs professional football team.
AS ANTI-CHINA sentiment rises in Washington, the Bush administration is caught in a complex balancing act: bashing Beijing enough to appease critics in Congress and stir action -- without provoking a trans-Pacific backlash.</br></br>The U.S. is exerting pressure on economic issues and criticizing China's human-rights policy and belligerence toward Taiwan, just as it is begging Chinese leaders for more help in curbing nuclear weapons in North Korea and hoping China won't cozy up to anti-American governments in places such as Venezuela.</br></br>"If we push too hard, this could cool China's ardor for helping us" on a number of issues, says David M. Lampton, director of China studies at the Nixon Center in Washington. Mr. Lampton says China also could potentially retaliate, for example, by shifting investments from U.S. dollar-denominated assets.</br></br>Complicating the White House calculus is soaring hostility on Capitol Hill, which some administration officials call "off the charts." Congress has largely deferred to President Bush's foreign- policy priorities, especially since Sept. 11, 2001, but China policy is one area where legislators are demanding a change of course, particularly on trade.</br></br>Nobody has felt that more than Treasury Secretary John Snow, who recently went to the Senate to testify about his department's budget and found himself in a hearing rife with anti-China anger. "China wants us to be a sponge for all their trinkets and trousers and shirts and shoes and all the things they produce, including high-tech, and yet, they don't want to open their market to us," Democratic North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan lectured the cabinet member, adding: "We sit around without the will, the nerve or the backbone to say this is nonsense; we're not going to put up with this anymore."
With the troubled California economy in a deep tailspin, Gov. Pete Wilson (R) said today his state would have to make drastic cuts in spending because of a $3 billion budget shortfall.</br></br>In an interview, Wilson said that record budget cuts and tax increases approved by the Legislature three months ago in an attempt to close the largest budget deficit of any state had proved insufficient. He said the Legislature would "have to make some very unpleasant choices" and hinted he would try again to win approval of cuts in education spending that both parties refused to consider this year.</br></br>New economic figures released by the California Commission on Finance show that the state remains mired in recession, with the loss of 380,000 jobs already this year, and cast new doubts on White House optimism that the nation is emerging from the recession.</br></br>California, with nearly one of eight of the nation's jobs, is often an economic barometer. The state's economy would be the seventh largest in the world if California were a nation. And because state officials closely monitor economic conditions, California often gives early warning of national trends.</br></br>What these trends showed in the finance commission's report was a drop of $344 million in tax collections during July, August and September. Commission director Kevin Scott forecast a $2.3 billion reduction in collections during the remainder of the fiscal year ending next June 30. He also said that spending would be $800 million higher than predicted because of increases in welfare caseloads and medical programs for the poor.
CHICAGO -- Plenty of Americans know that Japanese investors have gobbled up Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and New York's Rockefeller Center. But with less fanfare, the Japanese are also pouring money into trading in the booming U.S. financial futures markets.</br></br>It was only three years ago that Japanese securities firms began buying seats on Chicago's Board of Trade and Mercantile Exchange, the two biggest U.S. futures markets. Since then, Japanese trading here has increased sharply.</br></br>The Japanese may already account for as much as 40% of the volume in the bustling Eurodollar pit at the Chicago Merc, where financial futures based on the fluctuation of short-term interest rates are traded. Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Merc's executive committee, has predicted that by 1992 a third of the Merc's total volume will come from the Japanese.</br></br>Yet while financial markets in Japan at times are given to speculation, Japanese tastes here tend toward futures based on bonds and interest rates, contracts frequently used to hedge the risk of relatively conservative fixed-income investments like U.S. Treasury bonds.</br></br>"Certainly, Japanese investors have invested heavily in U.S. Treasury bonds and related futures, but not much in U.S. equities or the corresponding futures," said Nobuaki Ohmura, executive vice president of Daiwa Securities America Inc., a unit of one of the "Big Four" Japanese securities firms.
It's not clear what bright soul at the Washington Press Club Foundation chose "The Political Circus" as the theme for last night's Salute to the 101st Congress, but it couldn't have been more apt. As a few dozen clowns hired from Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circulated, doing pratfalls and stilt acts, the subjects of the salute stood grimly about in black tie, conjecturing, pontificating, obfuscating about the event in the center ring: the congressional pay raise.</br></br>"I just shouldn't comment," ran a typical response from Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who added with unaccustomed modesty, "There are so many of my colleagues more knowledgeable than I" about the issue.</br></br>If members were buzzing privately about Wright's plans to hold an eventual vote on a smaller raise, they weren't commenting publicly. "Who knows" how the raise issue will come out, said Rep. Bill Gray (D-Pa.). "Only the Shadow knows." "I have no idea" how the issue will be resolved, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), a longtime and vocal supporter of pay hikes for Congress. He turned to greet Budget Director Richard Darman, who, long known for his negotiating skills, nodded toward Rostenkowski and remarked, "He and I could settle this in no time." Asked for his own impressions of how the issue would be resolved, Darman smiled seraphically and responded, "Perfectly."</br></br>The annual Press Club Foundation Dinner-which will long be remembered as the scene of Redskins John Riggins' famous nap at the knee of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor-is a chance for press and pols in Washington to sit down together and do the big schmooze. This year, as one of the first major social events of the Bush presidency, the dinner gave the Grand Hyatt an air of electricity that has been absent from Washington for months.</br></br>Amid the crowd of senators and congressmen were powers of the new administration: White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, in white tie and tails, as this was just one of the parties he was called to last night, patiently answering question after question about the presidential throat (Bush's voice is still "brittle," he said). Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady in solemn conclave with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan ("Fine. Wonderful. Very exciting," said Brady about the administration's first 10 days, which have seen him heavily criticized for the proposal of a fee on savings and loan deposits). Bush speechwriter Peggy Noonan, and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp. Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater, and his future Democratic counterpart, Washington lawyer Ron Brown, working the room.
NEW YORK, May 20ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Late-afternoon action failed to erase the stock marketï¿½Ûªs early-morning advances today and prices closed slightly higher in listless trading.</br></br>Advancing Big Board issues, which earlier led losers by a margin of more than seven-to-four, finished ahead 739 to 618 with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks gaining 3.37 points to 923.41. Earlier in the day, the Dow was up more than 6 points but fell when buying enthusiasm waned as the session progressed.</br></br>Analysts said the upturn was an extension of Wednesdayï¿½Ûªs modest rally, when investors began showing interest in some of the more heavily oversold issues. The Dow average had fallen some 17 points Monday and Tuesday.</br></br>Investor morale also received something of a boost, analysts continued, from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burnsï¿½Ûª statement that the United States would not raise interest rates at home to help ease the international monetary situation.</br></br>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 13.34 million shares, up from 11.74 million on Wednesday.
Stockholders of Dan River Inc. voted yesterday to sell the giant textile firm to its employes and management rather than risk a takeover by a controversial New York investor.</br></br>Holders of 70.2 percent of all the shares voted in favor of the proposal, at, jthe annual meeting, Ipreyep^ngSa takeover by New York^ihvestor.ï¿½ÛªCarl Icahn.</br></br>1 Undqr the accepted proposal, the employes will jointly own 70 percent of Dan-River stock, with management receiving 25 per-, cent and the. consulting firm that ' fehgfneered' 'the deal, Kelso Associates, the remaining 5 percent. The employes will buy the stock back at $22.50 a share, 25 cen^-more,/than the current marxpt pfice. v ï¿½Ûª</br></br>Icahnf who' ovms a substanial block of the stock but abstained from voting for legal reasons,, stands, to^ make a profit estimated at abjput $8 million under the new plan. Icahn, contacted in his- New York'"office, would not comment on the vote.</br></br>The proposal .still must receive formal approval from the Secu-- rities and Exchange Commission. Trading of Dan River stock has been suspended on the New York Stock Exchange pending the SECï¿½Ûªs formal approval.
The White House and congressional leaders begin a crucial weekend of negotiations on a deficit-reduction deal under a cloud of dour economic news and mounting political pressures on both sides, casting doubt on how significant an agreement they can achieve.</br></br>President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) are battling opposition from within their own parties to their decision to strive for a plan that would reduce the deficit by $4 trillion over 10 years, in part by curbing entitlement spending and rewriting the tax code to boost revenue.</br></br>The two men surprised many in Washington this week by aiming for such an ambitious bargain, rather than a smaller package of roughly $2 trillion the White House and Congress had pursued for weeks. Although many Republicans and Democrats say they applaud the goal in theory, they also express doubts about reaching it given the major compromises it would require from both parties heading into an election year.</br></br>Mr. Obama and eight congressional leaders, including Mr. Boehner, are scheduled to meet at the White House on Sunday night to determine how big a deal they can achieve.</br></br>News that the unemployment rate rose to 9.2% in June, its highest level this year, pushed members of both parties further into their rhetorical corners Friday.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½On the same day that Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan applauded commercial banks for entering the securities business, the nation's other top bank regulator, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene A. Ludwig, criticized many of those same institutions for not doing a good job of telling their customers about the risks of securities.</br></br>Ludwig based his criticisms on a just-completed review of about 700 banks by his agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which regulates national banks.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We believe our review clearly shows the need for heightened attention to disclosure practices,ï¿½Û he said in a letter to Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice president of the American Bankers Association (ABA), an industry trade group.</br></br>The OCC survey found that a disturbing percentage of banks failed to conspicuously disclose the risks involved in customers taking their money out of savings accounts, which are insured by the government, and putting it into the securities markets, which are not federally insured.</br></br>For example, the OCC found that 17 percent of bank sales brochures examined failed to say that the investments being sold were not insured by the government. Another 20 percent said so only on the back page of the document, and 29 percent of the materials did not mention that customers could lose money on the investment being sold to them.
Corporate earnings in a typical recession would drop enough to make stock prices as overpriced as they wdre in the summer of 1987.</br></br>Why? It has to do with price-to-earnings ratios, an indicator used to tell whether you're paying too much fof a stock. With lower earnings possible, those ratios could go out of balance quickly.</br></br>Keep that in mind if you venture into the stock market. The bottom line is this: If there is a recession and company profits decline the typical 16 percent to 25 percent, the stock market would be back where it was right before the 1987 crash, with P/E ratios in the low 20s-to-l.</br></br>The stock marketï¿½Ûªs recent ascent has put P/E ratios at around 16.5-to-1. In 1987, the ratio was about 23-to-l for the 400 companies that make up the Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 400 stock index.</br></br>The P/E ratio for the stock market is a simple calculation derived by dividing the collective prices of companies (in this case the 400 S&P stocks) by the collective eaming9 per share of those companies, The ratio can increase either by the numerator (the stock prices) going up or by the denominator (the earnings) going down.
Author: Sara Schaefer MuÌ±oz</br></br>LONDON--U.S. authorities ordered HSBC Holdings PLC's North American unit to beef up its risk management and compliance with federal anti-money laundering laws after an investigation found the banking giant's procedures to be subpar.</br></br>Thursday's action, which came in the form of a "cease and desist" order from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is embarrassing because of the spotlight it shines on compliance lapses in a global bank with a cautious reputation and operations around the world.</br></br>The orders give the board of HSBC North America Holdings Inc., based in New York, 30 days to submit a plan to strengthen the unit's oversight of business risk management. The HSBC operation was ordered to "employ a permanent full-time" regional compliance officer for risk management. HSBC also must retain an outside consultant approved by the Fed to review the unit's compliance program.</br></br>The agreement announced Thursday included no fine, but HSBC could still face civil penalties down the road, regulators said.
Crowning the Jesse Unruh State Building, across the street from the Capitol in Sacramento, an inscription declares: "Bring Me Men to Match My Mountains."</br></br>Well, the men who have led California may not always have echoed the inspiring majesty of the Sierras or the rugged power of the Tehachapis. But like it or not, the governors of modern California have been almost perfectly matched to their times. The thoughtful Pat Brown, elected in 1958, earnestly believed in an expansive future, devoting himself to the transportation and education systems that would undergird the California economy. When things seemed to be moving too fast and too far, voters in 1966 replaced Mr. Brown with Ronald Reagan, who promised a return to the homespun values he made famous in his black-and-white movies. His successor in 1974, Jerry Brown, seemed to embody the ambiguity of the '70s, simultaneously preaching lowered expectations and iconoclastic -- some thought reckless -- innovation. Straight-arrow George Deukmejian saw California through the conformist 1980s, while ex-Marine Pete Wilson marched the state past recession and retrenchment in the early '90s.</br></br>So what does the landslide election of Gray Davis -- by any account, California's big winner of 1998 -- tell us about our own time? After all, Mr. Davis seems best defined by what he lacks in comparison to his predecessors -- that is, the vision of the elder Mr. Brown, the charisma of Mr. Reagan, the audacity of Mr. Brown Jr., the certitude of Mr. Deukmejian, the pugnacity of Mr. Wilson.</br></br>But for all the talk of how apt Mr. Davis's first name is, the new governor does seem to personify the cautious optimism with which California looks to the next millennium. Great calamities have befallen the state in the not-so-distant past, but the resolute way Californians rebuilt after earthquake and riot and recession proved that fundamental strengths remained to be -- and, indeed, should be -- tapped. To the steady Mr. Davis falls the task of harnessing those strengths -- without exhausting them.</br></br>Of course, for every winner, there is a loser. For this year, on the flip side of Mr. Davis's victory was the California Republican Party, which lost not only the governor's office, but also the statewide posts of attorney general and treasurer, seats in both houses of the Legislature and the campaign against Democratic U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer. This doubtless leaves the state GOP feeling confused and out-of-touch -- as the Democrats once did.
NEW YORK -- Consumer confidence bounced back in October after dipping sharply in September.</br></br>The survey, taken in the first two weeks of last month, reinforces evidence that the economy is still advancing. But analysts are still puzzling over what caused the previous month's decline.</br></br>"The September slide now appears to represent a pause in the long-running U.S. expansion, not a signal of a downturn. Latest readings suggest sustained growth ahead," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's Consumer Research Center.</br></br>The consumer confidence index gained almost all the ground lost in the September dip, rising to 117.4 from a revised 110.7 (originally reported as 109). In August, the index stood at 119.7. The Conference Board's Confidence Index, which uses 1985 as a base of 100, fell in September to its lowest level since just after the October 1987 stock market crash.</br></br>Nearly 20.6% of the 5,000 households surveyed by National Family Opinion Inc., Toledo, Ohio, for the Conference Board said they expect business conditions to improve over the next six months, compared with 18.3% in September. About 6.9% in the October survey said they expected business conditions to worsen, compared with 9.8% the previous month, according to the New York-based, nonprofit, industry-supported group.
The wheeling and dealing is over for the Redskins and every other NFL team. The trading deadline passed Tuesday. But at Redskin Park, the Jack Pardee Principle of Productivity has been firmly established.</br></br>The latest maneuvering by General Manage r Bobby Beathardï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Frank Grant traded to Tampa and Benny Malone obtained from Miamiï¿½ï¿½ï¿½demonstrated again that present productivityï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not years of service, past performance or even popularity with fans or teammatesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is the most important factor in a player's relationship with the organization.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢T think that's how every team in the league operates," Beathard said yesterday, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but that wasnï¿½Ûªt the reason for the Frank Grant trade or even the F.ddie Brown trade. Those were not examples of guys not producing. In both situations, we had the chance lo upgrade the football team and 'make it better. Thatï¿½Ûªs always the No. 1 consideration, "1 don't want our players lo think theyï¿½Ûªre expendable, because theyï¿½Ûªre not. And 1 think most of these guys have seen what we've done in the past, and weï¿½Ûªve got some credibility because we brought good people in. The players can sec that.ï¿½Û Sfnce Ap.ul 14, Beathard has choreographed 14 deals Involving players and draft choices, and his buttling average has been mostly spectacular.</br></br>His first deal produced a sixth-round draft choice from the 49ers in exchange for receiver Larry Jones. The Redskins used it to draft Tony Green. A No. 1 choice brought Lcmar Parrish and Coy Bacon from Cincinnati. Ricky Thompson came from Baltimore for a seventh-round choice, and John McDaniel from Kansas City for a loth-round choice.</br></br>' *1979 draft, he indicated they will have ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tifig choice in the first five rounds ..(probably a third), two picks in rounds six through 10, two selections in the , l^th round and one in the 12th. i.

WASHINGTON--Coming off one of the most difficult weeks of his presidency, Barack Obama has beefed up his political staff and is expected to deliver an uncompromising State of the Union address. Aides said Sunday that the White House wasn't making any abrupt policy shifts, even as the message was retooled to focus more sharply on job creation.</br></br>If anything, an unfinished agenda from 2009 will grow larger as, in addition to tackling health care and unemployment, the president presses for a bipartisan commission to tackle the budget deficit against resistance from Republicans.</br></br>White House officials said Obama campaign manager David Plouffe would be brought on as a political consultant as the White House gears up for the midterm elections.</br></br>The president's party is facing a stiff headwind from an electorate angry about high unemployment and what they see as ineffectual government, White House officials said. Republican Scott Brown's capture of the Massachusetts Senate seat Tuesday was a first shot in what Democrats worried would be hard-fought contests in November.</br></br>"People are working harder," White House senior adviser David Axelrod said Sunday on ABC's "This Week," referring to the economy. "If they have a job, they're working harder for less. They're falling behind. That's been true for a decade. They look at a wave of irresponsibility from Wall Street to Washington that led to that. And those were the frustrations that got the president elected in the first place, and they were reflected again on Tuesday" in the Massachusetts election.
NEW YORK, June 18 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Motors were active and higher as the stock market nudged ahead in slightly more active trading today.</br></br>Chrysler, up 2 points, was the star of the automotive group. The advance by Chrysler and several other assorted issues, said brokers, was due more to short covering than to any radical new bullish drive.</br></br>Short covering is the purchase of stock to repay borrowed stock which had been ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sold shortï¿½Û in the hopes of making a profit through a decline.</br></br>The monthly publication of the total of short sales on the New York Stock Exchange is expected tomorrow and Chrysler ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½whose stock has recently been split 2-for-1ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is expected to pile up a large total.</br></br>Polaroid, up 4%, was another example of short covering, said Street observers. The rest of the list showed a spotty pattern.
Chesapeake Energy Corp.'s effort to reassure investors worried about its cash shortage backfired with bond investors who were rattled by the harsh terms of the $3 billion short-term loan the company detailed Monday.</br></br>The price of the company's junk-rated bonds dropped sharply in heavy trading, as bondholders digested the steep interest rates on the new loan and the large funding gap that led Chesapeake to agree to it.</br></br>Chesapeake's most-traded bond, due in 2020, fell 6% to 91.64 cents on the dollar, according to pricing service Benchmark Solutions. About $971 million of the oil-and-gas driller's debt changed hands, accounting for 26% of all high-yield bonds traded, according to MarketAxess.</br></br>Concerns about the possibility of default rose -- the cost of insuring $10 million of Chesapeake bonds for one year against a potential default jumped by 36% to $727,000, according to Benchmark Solutions. Ratings agencies have assigned the company's debt double-B ratings, below investment grade, and last week Moody's Investors Service lowered the outlook to negative.</br></br>The drop in bond prices contrasted sharply with a relief rally in the embattled Oklahoma City-based company's stock, which rose 4.7% to $15.50 as equity investors welcomed word of the new liquidity.
NEW YORK, May 4-Stocks fell sharply today in moderate trading following a prediction of markedly higher interest rates by Salomon Brothers Inc. economist Henry Kaufman.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average, the most closely followed stock market indicator, closed at 1,165.31, off by 16.22 points, as only two of the 30 stocks that make up the average advanced, while 24 declined. Another four issues remained unchanged.</br></br>After one hour of trading todayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ before Kaufmanï¿½Ûªs statement that interest rates are likely to move ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½spectacularly higherï¿½Û reached the stock exchangesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the market was generally flat, with the Dow industrials off less than one point. Within a half hour of the news of Kaufmanï¿½Ûªs speech, industrials were down more than six points and the the indicator eventually dipped more than 20 points before recovering some of its early losses in late trading.</br></br>Analysts attributed the marketï¿½Ûªs move to Kaufmanï¿½Ûªs remarks. In general, highly publicized negative projections by well known economists like Kaufman move widely traded</br></br>The interest-rate-sensitive bond market, soured because of the Kaufman predictions and continuing positive economic indicators, was off today in moderate trading. Long government bonds, for instance, dropped by one and seven-thirty-seconds of a point to end at 91 and twenty-five thirty-seconds for the trading session.
Bank of America Corp., facing community-activist opposition to its $46 billion acquisition of FleetBoston Financial Corp., said it will lend and invest $750 billion over 10 years in communities for programs such as affordable housing.</br></br>Some consumer advocates have been against the acquisition because of concerns that Bank of America wouldn't make affordable housing a priority. Opponents of the bank's plan said yesterday the pledge is shy of details such as how much money might be invested in a specific community such as Boston, where FleetBoston is based. Those opponents said they will make their opposition known at public hearings that the Federal Reserve Board has scheduled next week in Boston and San Francisco.</br></br>The Fed extended the original Dec. 19 deadline for public comment to allow for next week's hearings because of opposition from groups that want to ensure that Bank of America, of Charlotte, N.C., commits to lending to low- and moderate-income groups. Still, the acquisition isn't expected to be derailed.</br></br>After what was then NationsBank Corp. agreed to acquire BankAmerica Corp. in 1998, the combined Bank of America pledged to invest $350 billion over 10 years. The bank said yesterday it has completed the fifth year of that pledge. Since 1999, the bank said it has loaned and invested $230 billion in economic-development initiatives. FleetBoston is in the last year of its own five-year, $14.6 billion commitment that ultimately exceeded that amount by about $4 billion.</br></br>The new pledge replaces both of those commitments, but activists want more from the bank.
j NEW YORK. July 12 W>.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ I Widely diversified demand for I individual issues put buying pep j into the stock market today and j sent prices higher.</br></br>Leadership of the rise was not concentrated in any major di-, vision but came rather from buoyant stocks responding to , specialized demand. The market had been zig-zagging for five days until it advanced today for the second straight session.</br></br>Foremost, the market hardly hobbled after Korean armistice ! talks were halted when armed j Communists refused United Na- ï¿½Û¢ tions journalists the right to go to the site of the conference between U. N. representatives and the Reds.</br></br>That indicated to traders that selling because of nervousness over Korean developments probably had spent itself. They also noted the refusal of the list to j decline and stay down after its initial bounce back from the yearï¿½Ûªs low a couple of weeks ago.</br></br>At the same time economic and business news had been on the bullish side. Steel production established the triple record of new production highs in June, in the second quarter, and in the first six months of this year. And industrial production in June held at the best level since 1945.
Emboldened by good economic news and better-than-expected corporate profits, investors woke up from their recent summer siesta yesterday and decided to chase stocks. They drove the Dow Jones industrial average up 70.90 points, nearly 2 percent, to 3846.73, the headiest level since late March. This follows Tuesday's 25-point gain.</br></br>Some market analysts saw the rally as a signal that the bull market is about to resume, while others took a more cautious stance and urged investors to watch and wait before buying in.</br></br>Traders were reacting in part to a stronger dollar and to the Commerce Department's durable-goods report yesterday that showed a 4.2 percent decline in demand for big-ticket items in July. It was the first decline since February.</br></br>Before falling last month, orders for durable goods, the expensive manufactured items that last at least three years, rose 1.2 percent in June after climbing 1.4 percent in April, according to the Commerce Department. Compared with year-ago levels, durable goods orders rose 1 percent in July.</br></br>A rising dollar and declining orders make it less likely, say Wall Streeters, that the Federal Reserve will soon boost short-term interest rates again, which could hurt the economic recovery.
Senate negotiations to craft a bipartisan budget deal proceeded in chaotic fits and starts Sunday, raising new questions about whether Congress would be able to steer the country away from the fiscal cliff.</br></br>The center of gravity had shifted by day's end after talks between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) reached an impasse.</br></br>Mr. McConnell instead struck up talks with Vice President Joe Biden, a former Senate colleague with whom he has worked on bipartisan budget deals in the past. The two men planned to talk by phone into the night, a McConnell aide said. No details of their discussions were immediately available.</br></br>The Senate had set itself a goal of hatching a deal by midafternoon Sunday, a deadline that slipped by as both sides instead bickered in public and tried to apportion blame for the continuing impasse. Mr. Reid recessed the Senate until Monday at 11 a.m.</br></br>"There is significant distance between the two sides," he said. "There is still time left to reach an agreement and we intend to continue negotiations."
President Clinton and Republican leaders are locked in a bitter debate over whether the federal budget should be balanced in 10 years (Clinton) or seven years (the GOP). A political train wreck looms, commentators warn, when Congress reconvenes in September.</br></br>If this were a fable, a small boy would cry out about now that the emperors have no clothes. But this is Washington: Mum's the word as our political leaders parade by, clad in see-through promises of balancing budgets by dates certain, creating millions of new high-wage jobs and cutting middle-class taxes.</br></br>These things can be done, but not through the low-growth and fiscally timid policies the current crop of emperors pursue. They have been cowed into damage-control economics by their rapacious financial markets, their overstimulated electorates and the swift change in global trade and investment patterns. They stand naked and hope nobody notices.</br></br>But the U.S. debate over the pace of budget deficit reduction exposes a basic change in the international political economy. Even the once endlessly optimistic Americans have scaled down their own expectations about how much growth their economic policies can -- and should -- deliver.</br></br>They are prepared to settle for less because stock and bond markets have spooked the world's political leaders and central bankers into a collective inflation phobia.
By every real-world sign, the latest being a plunge in global crude oil prices, there is no significant threat of inflation that would derail the American economic recovery. The consumer price index over the past three months has risen by an annual rate of a mere 1.9 percent. The index for medical care in this period has not moved up at all, a striking difference from the recent past.</br></br>The economy appears to be expanding moderately. A leading private organization, the business-oriented Conference Board, said this week that consumer confidence is at the highest point in nearly four years, promising a "sustained and reasonably vigorous economic expansion."</br></br>Yet, ironically, the stock and bond markets exhibit a bad case of frazzled nerves. The Dow Jones Industrial average closed yesterday at 3,626, off almost 9 percent, or 352 points in a two-month slide from a record 3,978 on Jan. 31. In the perverse spin Wall Street puts on good news, consumer confidence means growing future consumer purchases - and the markets interpret that confidence as a harbinger of inflationary pressures.</br></br>Interest rates, as measured by the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, jumped to 7.11 percent at the close of business yesterday, the highest level in a year, reflecting a continuing erosion in the value of bonds. The markets not only fear further Federal Reserve Board moves to boost short-term interest rates but no longer have confidence in Chairman Alan Greenspan's assurances that his "preemptive" strike against short-term rates will assuage fears of future inflation, and thus keep long-term interest rates in check.</br></br>Logic doesn't necessarily govern financial markets. Participants are now caught up in the worry that they have set a self-fulfilling prophecy on track, and that having scared themselves to death, there is no way to escape the punishment. But there is much more to explain the collapse of stock and bond prices than the markets' psychosis about future inflation. Behind the slump there exists a phenomenon largely unknown to the public, the existence of huge (and unregulated) speculative funds that made tons of money for their investors - usually, individuals who can gamble amounts in excess of $1 million - during last year's boom.

The U.S. economy showed signs of faster growth in the past six weeks, including an increase in manufacturing, the Federal Reserve said in its survey of regional economies. Most of the Fed's 12 districts that were surveyed suggested stronger growth in their regions. "Consistent with the generally more positive assessments of current economic activity, several districts noted increased optimism about economic prospects in coming months," the report said. Three districts -- Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco -- characterized economic activity as sluggish. Atlanta described business conditions as mixed. The Fed's report said that housing sales remained strong across various districts, helped by low mortgage rates.</br></br>Pillowtex -- maker of Cannon, Fieldcrest and Royal Velvet towels, bed linens and other home furnishings -- closed its 16 plants, eliminated 6,450 jobs and filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors. The company said it planned to wind down its business and dispose of its assets. Pillowtex had tried to find a buyer as a big debt-repayment deadline approached.</br></br>Equifax agreed to pay $250,000 to resolve allegations that it did not do enough to answer calls from consumers inquiring about their credit reports. The Federal Trade Commission had accused the company of violating an earlier settlement with the agency that imposed performance standards. In settling, the company did not acknowledge breaking any law.</br></br>Impath, a New York company that analyzes cancer tests for doctors, said it is investigating whether it improperly overstated money owed by customers and may report a loss this year. It said it will hire an independent lawyer and a forensic accountant to help with the investigation. It also said its vice president of finance and controller have resigned, but it declined to identify them; three other top executives have left in a little more than a year.</br></br>Canada's economy expanded 0.1 percent in May. Car sales were good. Gross domestic product, or the total value of goods and services produced, rose to an annualized $712.6 billion, Statistics Canada said in Ottawa. A drop in manufacturing tempered gains and signaled that the economy hasn't fully recovered from a 0.2 percent contraction in April.
U.S. retailers rang up strong sales last month, suggesting that the economy has regained momentum even as many lower-income consumers remain hard hit by high energy prices.</br></br>Retail sales jumped 1.4 percent in April, more than triple their mild 0.4 percent gain in March, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. Auto dealers, department stores, home furnishers, building materials and garden centers, grocers, and gasoline stations were among the retailers that reported sales growth.</br></br>Following the news last Friday that job growth rose sharply in April, the retail report provided more evidence that the economy rebounded last month after noticeably losing steam in March.</br></br>"Signs of a 'soft spot' are disappearing," said Kevin Cummins, an economist with UBS Securities LLC, referring to the weak retail sales and decline in hiring, factory production and consumer confidence in March.</br></br>At the same time, however, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and others that cater to lower-income households continue to blame high energy costs, particularly gasoline prices, for their sluggish sales growth in recent months.
By bidding up stock prices all year, investors were effectively betting the housing slowdown wouldn't engulf the broader economy. Yesterday, that confidence appeared to be shaken.</br></br>Stocks and corporate-bond markets tumbled amid selling that was more widespread than during the three previous days of triple-digit declines this month. Along with risky bonds and anything connected to the housing market, investors sold off stocks, emerging-markets bonds and even high-quality corporate debt. The record trading volume in stocks reflected rising anxiety.</br></br>Meanwhile, roughly 1,300, or nearly 17%, of the around 7,800 stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges hit their lowest price of the past 12 months.</br></br>To many investors, that made yesterday's selloff more ominous than other big declines this year. Sid Bakst, a senior portfolio manager at investment firm Robeco Weiss, Peck & Greer, said the steady drip of bad news on subprime-mortgage loans and the failure of some leveraged buyouts to get long-term financing has made investors increasingly nervous.</br></br>"As each day has gone by, things have been leaking a bit more," Mr. Bakst said. "But today there was full-blown carnage."
NEW YORK-One of the many ways in which inflation lias changed our lives is Dial we have all become much more aware of the need to iindersliuid personal finance. In response In this need, courses have sprung up in nearly every community, geared to leaching people how the financial system works and what their choices are.</br></br>The area of grealest interest, course directors say, is pre-retirement planning. At retirement, people normally go from earned incomes that increase with inflation, to fixed incomes, which erode at ' a frightening pace. Through advance planning, you can try to nnticipale the problems that result, and get some sensible advice on how lo handle them.</br></br>Financial planning courses may he offered in several places in your community by your employer, your union, a library, the public school system, a community college or university, or even the city government. Mycr Schlein, Director of Pre-Retirement Planning and Counseling for the City of Baltimore, recently pul together a lisl of some 300 organizations that offer these courses,</br></br>They're usually free or offered at nominal charge. Speakers are apt lo he local expertsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½from banks, accounting firms, brokerage offices and social security.

NEW YORK, Nov. 1 (A?) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The stock market managed to post a small gain today, wavering erratically in the last trading before Tuesdayï¿½Ûªs presidential election;</br></br>The DowJones average of 30 industrial stocks, on the minus side for the first half of the session, wound up 1.16 points ahead at 966.09.

Not even the Wizard of Oz slid as swiftly from apparent invincibility to apparent impotence as Indonesia's President Suharto. Now his demise seems readily explainable, as these things always are in retrospect. When his economic miracle morphed into economic crisis, Asia's longest-reigning dictator lost the legitimacy that had masked or excused his regime's many failings while allowing him to buy off potential foes. And when he was forced to kowtow so visibly to the IMF to ensure his nation's survival, he lost the aura of inevitable power that had kept so many of his voiceless subjects living in fear.</br></br>So what is striking now, in retrospect, is not Suharto's fall -- not the apparently frail old man who emerged with trembling voice from behind the Wizard's curtain -- but rather how, up until the very last moment, the outside world doubted and disparaged Indonesia's "People Power." Indonesia was not ready for democracy, was the consensus that only Indonesians chose to ignore; Suharto could not fall.</br></br>Why so many held so misguided a view for so long is worth examining now because many of the same voices can be heard again, touting stability over democratic change. The Clinton administration, to its credit, is no longer among them; President Clinton quickly recognized Suharto's resignation as only the first step of a necessary process of democratic change. But many others seem ready to send the unruly students home. Enough upheaval for now, is their message; let's get back to the business of healing a crippled economy -- even though Suharto's repressive system remains, so far, unchanged.</br></br>Their logic is the same as when they were explaining why Suharto could not be replaced. Indonesia is too poor, and its economy too damaged, to manage a political transition now. The opposition is too fragmented, without ideology or program, united only in its disgust for the nepotism and corruption of the Suharto regime. There is no single opposition leader with the stature to unite a nation of so many islands, religions and ethnic groups.</br></br>Mix in the absence of viable political parties and civic institutions after 32 years of stifling dictatorial rule. Recall the lack of democratic tradition in a country that has experienced only two transitions in the past half-century, both violent. Add a Javanese culture of patrimonial rule, communal values and mystical respect for power wielded from above.

Most of the government's 500,000 blue-collar workers will be able to set aside a bigger chunk of their salaries for the new federal investment plan-and also get bigger matching contributions from the government-than their white-collar colleagues.</br></br>That is possible because the law setting up the thrift plan permits employes whose pay has been limited by Congress to make larger contributions based on the prevailing local wage for their skills.</br></br>In the Washington area, for example, the average pay for electricians, mechanics, carpenters and other similar workers is $23,400, according to the Office of Personnel Management.</br></br>But federal officials say that the wage rate for those jobs here is now actually 14 percent higher than the government average.</br></br>Despite the fact that federal law requires the government to pay wages equal to the private sector's, Congress has limited raises in recent years to the same amount granted white-collar workers.

The price of oil briefly rose to $100 a barrel for the first time yesterday and fresh evidence emerged that the economy is slowing. To investors, the news raised the specter of stagflation, the toxic mix of stagnant economic growth and price inflation that made for hard times in the 1970s.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.7 percent, or about 221 points, as investors moved money into safer investments.</br></br>"Not very fun, is it?" said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist of Wells Capital Management. "The news today just conjures up some frightening possibilities. Happy New Year."</br></br>After months of flirting with a price of $100 per barrel, one midday trade for crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday was for that much. The price of a barrel closed at $99.62. Gold closed at an all-time high of $860 an ounce for the February contract. The prices of wheat, soybeans and frozen concentrated orange juice were all up sharply, too. The dollar fell against the Japanese yen and other currencies.</br></br>And rising prices come as the nation's manufacturing sector appears to be contracting, according to the Institute for Supply Management, which surveys manufacturers. Its index, released yesterday, fell to 47.7 in December from 50.8 in November, a worse drop than even the most bearish analysts had predicted. A reading of more than 50 indicates expansion; a reading of less than 50 denotes contraction.
From San Jose, Costa Rica, to Mexico City, Latin American nations are mounting challenges to lessen the impact of the sweeping new U.S. immigration law.</br></br>Officials there fear the law will lead to massive deportations that will worsen already severe unemployment and wipe out a significant source of foreign revenue: the money illegal immigrants send back to families in their homelands. (Those monies are estimated to represent the third largest source of foreign revenue for Mexico, the nation that is expected to be hurt most by the new law.)</br></br>About 70% of the estimated six million illegal immigrants in the U.S. are from Latin America; nearly one-fifth of the population of El Salvador is estimated to reside in the U.S., mostly illegally. As a result, for the foreign governments -- especially in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras -- the adoption of the law was tantamount to a foreign-policy declaration by the U.S.</br></br>"Mexico recognizes the sovereign right of every state to legislate," said Mexico's Consul General Hermilo Lopez-Bassols in a recent radio address in Houston. But when that right affects the interests of other nations, he says, "the issue becomes transnationalized and, therefore, demands consultations and negotiations."</br></br>The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service insists that fears of massive deportations are unfounded. "There will be no mass deportations. We just don't have the resources," says Mark Everson, INS executive associate commissioner.

Every few years, critics say Warren Buffett has lost his touch. He's too old and too old-fashioned, they claim. He doesn't get it anymore. This time he's wrong.</br></br>It happened during the dotcom bubble, when Mr. Buffett was mocked for refusing to join the party. And it happened again last year. As the Dow tumbled below 7,000, Mr. Buffett came under fire for having jumped into the crisis too early and too boldly, making big bets on Goldman Sachs and General Electric during the fall of 2008, and urging the public to plunge into shares.</br></br>Now it's time for those critics to sit down for their traditional three course meal: humble pie, their own words and crow.</br></br>On Saturday, Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported that net earnings rocketed 61% last year to $5,193 per share, while book value jumped 20% to a record high. Berkshire's Class A shares, which slumped to nearly $70,000 last year, have rebounded to $120,000.</br></br>Those bets on GE and Goldman? They've made billions so far. And anyone who took Mr. Buffett's advice and invested in the stock market in October 2008, even through a simple index fund, is up about 25%.
Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest maker of insulin, cut its sales guidance for the full year because of challenges to its U.S. business, even as it reported a greater-than-expected rise in net profit.</br></br>The Danish drug maker cut its sales-growth guidance in local currencies for the full year to a range of 7% to 10%, from the 8%-to-11% range it gave in January, mainly because of a difficult rebate and contract environment in the U.S. and intensifying competition within the diabetes-treatment field.</br></br>The company maintained expectations of operating-profit growth of around 10% for the full year.</br></br>When asked about industry consolidation and Pfizer Inc.'s rebuffed takeover approach for AstraZeneca PLC, Novo's rival in diabetes treatment, Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said Novo Nordisk was focused on organic growth rather than mergers and acquisitions.</br></br>"Novo Nordisk has no intentions of participating in the current consolidation in the industry," Mr. Brandgaard said on a conference call Thursday. "We believe that the focus that Novo Nordisk has is a key driver behind the success of the company."
When it comes to technology companies, the stock marketï¿½Ûªs current mania, itï¿½Ûªs hard to top America Online Inc. Technology stocks are hot, up about 50 percent on average this year, but AOL is positively scalding, up about 135 percent. In fact, AOLï¿½Ûªs stock has soared more than 2,000 percent from its initial public offering, in 1992. The Vienna-based company has 35 times the customers and 20 times the revenue it had five years ago. Itï¿½Ûªs the nation's biggest on-line company and is building a recognized brand.</br></br>But look closely and you see that AOL is as much about accounting technology as it is about computer technology. So make sure you understand the</br></br>Accounting is terribly important to AOL. The better its numbers look, the more Wall Street loves it and the easier AOL can sell new shares to raise cash to pay its bills. By my analysis, the company is running a cash deficit of about $75 million a yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a deficit it covers with money from stock sales. Thus, if AOL canï¿½Ûªt sell stock, itï¿½Ûªs got big trouble. At the least, it would have to drastically scale back its expansion plans.</br></br>Lennert Leader. But the point isnï¿½Ûªt that AOL violates the rulesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½it clearly doesnï¿½Ûªt. The point is that you can satisfy the rules and still make it incredibly difficult for investors to know whatï¿½Ûªs going on.</br></br>This is a particularly good time to look at AOL, because on Oct. 10 it raised about $100 million by selling new shares. AOL sold the stock even though its shares had fallen to $58.37'/2 from about $72 in September, when the sale plans were announced. Most companies would have delayed the offering, waiting for the price to snap back. AOL didnï¿½Ûªt, prompting cynics to think the company really needed the money, if only because its trade accounts payable had ballooned to $85 million as of June 30 from $16 million a year earlier.
When President Ford drew his magic marker on the chart representing the potential size of this yearï¿½Ûªs budget deficit and said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I draw the lineï¿½Û against further red-ink spending, it was more than the gesture-of-the-week his television advisers now provide with every presidential utterance.</br></br>It was, in addition, a symbol of the altered relationship between Congress and Chief Executive which has developed since the twin cataclysms of 1974 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the resignation of Richard Nixon and the election of the heavily Democratic, post-Watergate Congress.</br></br>It is a relationship in which initiative and, one is tempted to say, control have passed from the Executive to the Legislative Branch; in which Congress is on the offensive and the President is responding as best he can.</br></br>Whether one considers this a calamity or a matter for congratulation depends, of course, on whether one dreads or delights in the work of Congress. As Arthur M. Schlesinger ï¿½ï¿½tr. noted long ago, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The question of tne distribution of power between the President and the Congress, in foreign as well as in domestic affairs, is a matter not of right or wrong but of practical results.ï¿½Û</br></br>In practice, it is not at all clear whether Mr. Ford can in fact ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½draw the lineï¿½Û on this Congress. Certainly, he cannot dictate to it. It has been a triumph of public relations, but little else, for Mr. Ford to create the impression during the past two months that he was whipping Congress on to pass a tax cut.
Political discourse in modern America usually proceeds on one of two levels -- either slogans ("It's Morning in America"), or specific policies (individual retraining accounts). The vast area between, where slogans are connected to policies and policies are linked to one another, is often the most important but the least discussed. Here is forged a public philosophy.</br></br>Since the end of the Great Society, conservative Republicans have busily been seeding this value-laden terrain. Through countless articles, books, academic studies and conferences, they have concocted a relatively coherent public philosophy. Liberal Democrats, by contrast, have had an abundance of slogans and detailed programs, but they have tended in recent years to ignore the normative vision lying between. As a result, their public philosophy has seemed muddled. This has cost them dearly.</br></br>Robert Lekachman, a professor of economics at City University of New York, understands the importance of a coherent public philosophy and worries that liberals have lost their way. In his "Visions and Nightmares: America After Reagan" (Macmillan, 316 pages, $19.95), he sets out the central challenge for America's left -- to articulate principles of equity and social justice, "and appeal to passions of morality and patriotism that avoid the chauvinism and intrusions into lifestyles of the political right."</br></br>Mr. Lekachman has two recurring nightmares about American society after Ronald Reagan. The first is that America will slip into a deeper and more prolonged neoconservativism. It will feature the privatization of public services and its corollary, the substitution of vouchers for publicly funded services; the destruction of labor unions and thus a continued downward drift in real wages; in consequence of both, an increasing gulf between the rich and the poor; an enlarged and engorged military; and so on.</br></br>Mr. Lekachman's other nightmare is that "neoliberals" will be in charge. He defines them (along with your reviewer) as people who, in contrast to conventional liberals, believe in market solutions and assume social harmony. "For them, politics seems less group conflict than the search for tax, regulatory, and mild planning initiatives that promote enough growth to soften the harsh edges of ancient struggles between rich and poor, black and white, males and females, the sunbelt and the rust belt." Neoliberals are individualists, technocrats and yuppies. They come perilously close to being neoconservatives. You wouldn't want them living next door, least of all in power.
The stock market has treated investors well recently. But taking a longer view, it has been downright abusive.</br></br>Even with a gain of 4% since the start of the year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has, with dividends reinvested, lost 8% since reaching its peak in October 2007. Adjust the index for inflation, and the news is worse--it has lost 18% since August 2000. Anybody who put money into an S&P 500 index fund between late 1998 and early 2001 remains in the red.</br></br>When was the last time that so much time elapsed and the U.S. stock market still remained below its inflation-adjusted peak? Never, according to the monthly price and return data from Yale University economist Robert Shiller's reconstruction of the S&P 500 back to 1871. Even investors who bought on the eve of the 1929 crash were briefly above water, in inflation-adjusted terms, in 1937. Of course, since this owes to the deflation experienced during the Great Depression, strictly speaking the mattress was still a better place to put your money.</br></br>But while the stock market has been faring poorly, stocks have been doing better. The equal-weighted S&P 500 index, which puts all stocks on the same footing rather than weighting them by market capitalization, has beaten the regular index hands down. Since August 2000, it has returned an inflation-adjusted 52%.</br></br>A big reason the equal-weighted S&P has outperformed is that it's a sneaky way of value investing. In the late 1990s, retail investors who bought a vanilla S&P 500 fund, along with investment managers who benchmarked the sector weightings in their portfolios to the index, were loading up on expensive technology stocks. In the mid 2000s, they were buying heavily into the shares of housing and finance-related companies.
NEW YORK -- Some commodity traders, spooked by recent stock-market bumps, have shortened the span they keep contract positions, reflecting the rippling psychological effects of the stock crash.</br></br>Before this month's events, traders in many raw-material markets initiated trading positions and held them for several weeks to let a trading strategy pan out. Now, however, a growing number of futures traders -- even those with little direct contact with the stock market -- are closing contract positions at the end of each day, fearing huge losses.</br></br>"It's just too risky now," says Eric Bolling, an oil trader and vice president at Geldermann Inc., New York, who has cut back his longer-term trading. "There are too many things happening out there that can blow your position out of the water."</br></br>Futures traders most affected by the recent tumult continue to be those trading stocks' closely-related shadow markets -- stock-index futures and options. And many independent traders, or locals, typically close their positions at the end of the day, no matter what the trading instrument.</br></br>Still, says Shahrokh Nikkhah, vice president, futures, at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., New York: "For all those in the commodity markets, short-term trading is the way to go right now."
FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. reported an 8.6% increase in third-quarter earnings as "longer cycle" businesses offset softness in other areas.</br></br>The electrical and consumer products, broadcasting and financial services concern said net income rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.16 a share, from $945 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.2% to $14.2 billion from $13 billion.</br></br>Per-share earnings were up 12%, partly reflecting purchases by the company of 12 million of its shares during the quarter. GE had 878 million shares outstanding Sept. 30, compared with 906.4 million a year earlier. GE has bought back 35 million shares since its share-purchase program began in November.</br></br>GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. termed the performance "good" in spite of a weakening economy and the Mideast crisis, which he said slowed such lines as plastics, lighting and appliances. Those are known as GE's "shorter cycle" businesses, as contrasted to "longer cycle" lines such as aircraft engines, medical systems and power generation. The chairman also said the GE Appliance unit was able to compensate for the sales softness with productivity gains.</br></br>Mr. Welch said that despite considerable uncertainty in the U.S. economy, GE "expects 1990 to be the fourth straight year of a double-digit increase in earnings per share."
Americansï¿½Ûª personal income rose 0.5 percent last month and consumer spending increased 0.6 percent, suggesting a slight improvement in economic growth this quarter, economists said.</br></br>The increase in personal income was attributable in part to special factors last month, such as a pay raise for federal civilian and military personnel, cost-of-living adjustments for several federal pension and income programs and increases in tax rates and the taxable wage 'base for personal contributions for social insurance, the Commerce Department reported.</br></br>Additionally, a shift in the timing of payment of military retirement benefits and a large increase in December in retroactive Social Security benefit payments affected personal income in both January and December, Commerce said.</br></br>Without those special factors, personal income would have risen 0.1 percent in January and 0.7 percent in December.</br></br>White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the figures released yesterday show ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a continued moderate growth in personal income and consumer spending. These are positive signs as the economy moves into a new year of sustained growth.ï¿½Û
In your Dec. 27 editorial "Flacking for Rubinomics" you misinterpreted the nature, analysis and conclusions of our research paper on "The Economic Effects of Fiscal Discipline."</br></br>The main point of our paper is that standard economic reasoning, present in almost all macroeconomic textbooks, implies that budget deficits reduce national saving and therefore reduce the future income and living standards of American households. For example, under conservative assumptions and a methodology developed by Harvard professor Greg Mankiw, we show that the $5 trillion decline in projected 10-year surpluses over the past two years translates roughly into a reduction in future income of $1,500 per household per year. That is the real cost of a lack of fiscal discipline.</br></br>These costs occur regardless of whether budget deficits raise interest rates, which reduces Americans' domestic investment, or cause a capital inflow, which reduces Americans' net investment overseas. Therefore, the debate about deficits and interest rates is a bit of a red herring.</br></br>Nonetheless, recent evidence supports the view that deficits affect interest rates. This evidence comes from almost all major macro-econometric models, almost all studies done since 1990, and in particular from studies that properly focus on the relation between interest rates and expected future deficits (rather than current deficits). These facts were somehow omitted in your editorial.</br></br>Contrary to the what you wrote, we emphasize the distinction between the deficit itself and the policies that create the deficit. Thus, for example, the 2001 tax cut had positive effects on economic growth from cutting marginal tax rates, but negative effects due to the increase in the deficit. On balance, all of the existing studies show that the negative effects largely offset and may even outweigh the positive effects. As a result, the net effect of the tax cut on growth is likely to be small and could be negative.

The Carter administration intends to stick with its goal of a 3 percent after-inflation increase in defense spending rather than acceding to new demands for higher amounts.</br></br>Several senators have suggested they will not vote for the pending strategic arms limitation treaty (SALT II) without a greater defense increase.

A proposal for a consolidated ticker tape ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ the first step toward implementing a central nationwide stock marketï¿½ï¿½ï¿½was made public yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</br></br>The plan ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ jointly drafted by the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, three regional exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½calls for a two-network tape system listing last sale prices ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½on a current and continuous basisï¿½Û of all eligible securities.</br></br>A first-stage pilot program is proposed which would go into effect no later than 20 weeks after the SEC approves the plan.</br></br>Under the pilot program, the last sale prices of 15 stocks will be merged into the New York Stock Exchange tape, and the market in which the sale is executed will be identified.</br></br>The 15 common stocks to he selected will be among those listed and registered on the NYSE and traded as well on one or more of the regional exchangesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the Pacific, Midwest and the PBW.

NEW YORK -- The bond markets rallied late yesterday as the Reagan administration again urged the Federal Reserve System to ease its credit hold in order to bolster the growth of the nation's money supply.</br></br>Prices, which had been down earlier in the day, wound up little changed from Tuesday's closing levels. The early-session losses stemmed mainly from dealer nervousness over the federal government's huge financing needs.</br></br>The Treasury yesterday afternoon announced plans to sell $17.5 billion of new notes and bonds in its quarterly financing operation. The package consists of $6.5 billion of three-year notes to be auctioned Monday, $5.75 billion of 10-year notes to be sold Wednesday and $5.25 billion of 30-year bonds to be auctioned the following day.</br></br>The size of the package was slightly larger than the Treasury indicated in mid-October, when it released a tentative schedule showing only a $17 billion financing operation.</br></br>But concerns quickly faded after Beryl Sprinkel, undersecretary of the Treasury for monetary affairs, echoed recent administration statements calling for an easier Fed policy. "We think there is plenty of room for some easing of monetary policy," he told reporters at the Treasury's financing briefing. He warned that the money supply's recent sluggish growth could endanger the economic expansion.

Gold prices slid Monday, as a stronger U.S. dollar led investors to sell the precious metal.</br></br>Gold for December delivery, the most actively traded contract, fell $13, or 1%, to $1,254.30 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close for the precious metal since June 9.</br></br>Prices for gold have been under pressure from a burgeoning dollar, with investors flocking to the U.S. currency as the economic recovery gains momentum and on expectations of a rise in interest rates next year. A rising dollar is bad news for gold, an asset many investors buy to offset the risk of dollar weakness. In addition, higher interest rates make gold a less attractive investment, as the metal costs money to hold and struggles to compete with investments that offer yield during times of tightening monetary policy.</br></br>On Monday, the dollar was up 0.8% against the yen at 105.91, a six-year high. The British pound was down 1.3% against the U.S. currency at $1.61. Gold prices are down about 5% from July highs.</br></br>"The stronger dollar and weak U.S. inflation are keeping investors on the sidelines," said James Cordier, a principal at Liberty Trading Group. "The landscape for gold is not bullish at all."
The euro and other higher-yielding currencies slumped against the dollar and Japanese yen Thursday as riskier assets fell out of favor on investor concerns about the slow pace at which the world economy is recovering from recession.</br></br>"We've got a global recovery under way, but people are beginning to question it, and that's taken them out of the euro and back into the dollar and yen," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Conn.</br></br>Slumping stock and commodity prices pushed investors back into the U.S. and Japanese currencies. Indications from around the globe of a more restrictive official stance toward capital flows and currency volatility also contributed to a more cautious investment environment. Worries about the global economy tend to favor the dollar and the yen, and erode demand for assets sensitive to economic growth, including stocks and so-called commodity currencies.</br></br>Late in New York, the euro was at $1.4919 from $1.4960 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 89.08 yen from 89.378, while the euro was at 132.90 yen from 133.69 yen. The U.K. pound was at $1.6659 from $1.6740. The dollar was at 1.0134 Swiss francs from 1.0101 francs. The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback's moves against a trade-weighted basket of six currencies, was at 75.264 from 75.079.</br></br>Meanwhile, the dollar got another show of support Thursday from Saudi Arabia. The International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Rights can't replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, the governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, Muhammad Al-Jasser, said in Frankfurt.

Correction: A July 13 Page One article about people who have been unemployed so long that they are no longer eligible for benefits misstated the period for which Maryland provides benefits. Maryland offers a total of 73 weeks, not 86 weeks, of unemployment benefits. (Published 7/20/2010)</br></br>Even before his unemployment checks ended, Dwight Michael Frazee's days were filled with the pursuit of any idea that could earn him a buck. But few are working out, and now his nights are filled with dread.</br></br>In the coming weeks, the Senate is expected to resume its debate about whether to extend the emergency jobless benefits that were passed in response to the steep increase in unemployment caused by the recession. But people like Frazee, who have suffered the longest in the downturn, will not be part of that conversation. They are among the 1.4 million workers who have been unemployed for at least 99 weeks, according to the Labor Department, reaching the limit for the insurance. Their numbers have grown sixfold in the past three years.</br></br>The 99ers are glaring examples of the nation's most serious bout of long-term joblessness since the Great Depression. Nearly 46 percent of the country's 14.6 million unemployed people have been out of work for more than six months, and forecasters project that the situation will not improve anytime soon. Currently, the Labor Department says there are nearly five unemployed people for every job opening.</br></br>Frazee, 50, has applied for work at more places than he can remember since he lost his construction job two years ago. He has tried car dealerships, Kmart, Home Depot and the funky shops on the boardwalk in Seaside Heights, near Toms River. He looked into becoming a commercial crabber, working in title insurance and as a bail bondsman. But no dice.
Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns said yesterday that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½at the present time, any tax (cut) legislation is prematureï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûªï¿½ï¿½ï¿½by implication, though not director, criticizing Ronald Reaganï¿½Ûªs recent proposal for a one-year antirecession tax cut.</br></br>In a conference with & group of reporters, Burns said that to cut taxes now ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½would be attacking a short-term economic problem and not the longer-run problem which is far more serious. ... In an election season, tax legislation ought not to be written. We can wait.ï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª</br></br>Burns also called attention to a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½difference in prioritiesï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª between Reaganï¿½Ûªs tax proposal and one offered by a recently organized Committee to Fight Inflation, which Burns heads.</br></br>The Reagan proposal, including a 10 percent personal income tax cut across the board, would give about 90 percent of a $21 billion reduction in fiscal 1981 to individuals and only 10 percent to Business.</br></br>The Burns committee gives greater emphasis to reducing business taxes, gradually in the next two years and at an accelerated pace in the three following years. It does not include any per-
D.C. Council member Betty Aim Kane (D-At Large), responding to an audit that disclosed the cityï¿½Ûªs first budget deficit in eight years, joined critics of the report yesterday who contend the it substantially understates the severity of the cityï¿½Ûªs financial problems.</br></br>Kane, a member of the Finance and Revenue Committee, said Mayor Marion Barryï¿½Ûªs administration used $13.9 million in leftover federal funds and fees to offset the reported deficit, but said the money represented only a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½paper savings" that had no real effect on other city spending.</br></br>The deficit of $14.3 million reported by Barry would have risen to $28.2 million without the change, said Kane.</br></br>She said she would use a council hearing on the audit today also to ask questions about why the city spent $8 million less than was allocated for the housing and econom-icdevelopment budget.</br></br>She suggested that the city might have been using the housing budget to cover overruns in other agencies.
NEW YORK -- With the U.S. economy continuing to surge ahead, the dollar won't be far behind. It is only how fast it can travel this week that is in question.</br></br>Few disagree the dollar is headed higher against the yen and euro, guided by the U.S. economy's strength relative to Europe and Japan.</br></br>In fact, last Friday's higher-than-expected employment data took a lot of uncertainty out of the market over the need for a tightening of interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The figures again underlined the U.S. economy can grow at a strong pace without inflation.</br></br>While lower U.S. rates usually mean a weaker dollar as the yield on dollar-denominated deposits declines, capital flows into the U.S. currency are increasing in line with gains in the U.S. stock market, said Joe Yuska, foreign-exchange manager at Banc One International in Dallas.</br></br>"There is nothing in the horizon that will trip up the dollar," said Mr. Yuska, who expects the euro could pass last week's low of $1.0785 to test $1.0680.
From left, Saul Hymans, Arthur M. Okun and Henry C. Wallich testify before the Joint Economic Committee.</br></br>Former Economic Council Chairman Arthur M. Okun yesterday sharply crtitcized the Nixon Administration for seeking to abandon a 4 per cent target for unemployment as the basic definition of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½full employment.ï¿½Û But Henry C. Wallich a Yale economics professor and an adviser to the secretary of the Treasury, said that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the 4 per cent full employment level no longer has the significance that it used to have. Today, 4 per cent unemployment unfortunately is more inflat-tionary than in the past.ï¿½Û Okun, Wallich and Prof. Saul H. Hymans of the University of Michigan appeared as a panel before the Joint Economic Committee, now conducting hearings on the budget and economic report of President Nixon.</br></br>Each forecast a Gross National Product somewhat under the Administrationï¿½Ûªs projection of a $100 billion improvement this year. Wal-</br></br>United States securities and commodities exchanges will be closed on Monday, the day designated for celebration of Washingtonï¿½Ûªs birthday.</br></br>Banks, savings and loans, state and federal offices and some business offices will be closed, giving employes a three-day holiday. But Washington retail stores will remain open and department stores have scheduled holiday sales.
Easy come, easy go.</br></br>Barely two months after closing a record year, the huge private investment funds that swing through international currency and bond markets are enduring a stark reversal of fortune.</br></br>Steinhardt Partners, Tiger Management, Caxton Corp., Omega Advisers and Soros Fund Management have had losses of hundreds of millions of dollars over the past few weeks. That's a setback of as much as 10% for some hedge funds, the private investment partnerships that borrow to the hilt to make big bets on the direction of markets.</br></br>But the gunslingers aren't suffering alone. The proprietary trading desks of big investment and commercial banks, which act as in-house hedge funds, have also been hit. Over the last several years, these institutions have been willing to accept an increasing amount of risk because of the benign environment of falling interest rates, which generally boost the value of fixed-income investments.</br></br>No more. With interest rates rising this year, one market after another has turned into Sherman's march to the sea. There seem to be as many ways to lose money as there were to make it last year. Among the causes of misfortune: the surprisingly steep decline of the dollar against the yen, which came quickly on the heels of rising interest rates in Japan and Europe.
What's the biggest mutual fund group that most investors have never heard of?</br></br>Mutual-fund giants Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group may be household names. But since the 1987 stock market crash, investors have poured more money into the conservative stock funds run by Capital Group Inc., a Los Angeles money manager that deliberately keeps a very low profile.</br></br>Capital Group, through its mutual-fund arm American Funds Group, operates two of the nation's three largest stock mutual funds. With $50 billion in total stock mutual funds, Capital Group ranks second only to Fidelity's $65 billion.</br></br>Yet, few investors have ever heard of Capital Group. Its funds don't advertise; instead, they are "load" funds that carry a sales commission and are sold only through stockbrokers and financial planners.</br></br>"They're the silent giant," says John Rekenthaler, a mutual-fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. He adds: "These guys are dynamite in the brokerage community, the most respected name of the independent load fund groups." A study by Sanford Bernstein & Co. indicates that Capital Group grew faster between 1986 and 1991 than any other major fund group.
The global economy faces a collapse not equaled since the Great Depression of the 1930s if the major nations fail to take quick and drastic steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit and equivalent surpluses in Europe and Asia, 33 leading economic experts warned yesterday.</br></br>That danger, they said, was signaled by the stock market collapse around the world in October and by an earlier plunge of the U.S. bond market.</br></br>The economists' conclusions were contained in a report issued here by the Institute for International Economics and simultaneously published by eight other international research centers.</br></br>The economists said Americans would have to accept a sharp cutback in personal consumption in the years ahead so that more U.S.-made goods could be shipped abroad to reduce the trade deficit.</br></br>As this somber forecast was issued, the Reagan administration was nearing completion of its official estimates for economic growth next year, lowering its prediction by about 1 percentage point to reflect the impact of the October stock market collapse.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell slightly in yesterdayjs auction to their lowest rate in two weeks.</br></br>The Treasury Department sold $6.42 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 6.84 percent, down from 6.96 percent last week. An additional $6.41 billion in six-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.21 percent, down from 7.34 percent last week.</br></br>The discount rate understates the actual yield to investors. The investment, or coupon-equivalent, rate was 7.08 percent on the 13-week bills at an average price of $9,827.10 per $10,000 face value. The investment rate on the 26-week bill was 7.61 percent at an average price of $9,635.50 per $10,000 face value.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	Oil prices plummeted by 42 cents a barrel yesterday as panic selling on Wall Street spilled over onto the New York Mercantile Exchange and wiped out early gains sparked by the U.S. attack on an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf.</br></br>Oil traded on international markets surged by as much as 45 cents a barrel immediately after four Navy destroyers damaged an armed Iranian oil platform in retaliation for Tehran's missile strike against a U.S.-flagged Kuwaiti oil tanker yesterday.
Nia Janyska had an assortment of wicker baskets in front of her, along with colorful votive candles, chocolate bars, packets of tea and small framed samples of her meticulous cross-stitch.</br></br>"Put them in neatly, nice and neatly," the 34-year-old said as she filled the baskets. "Make sure the decoration shows, so the customer buys them."</br></br>Janyska was explaining her technique for arranging gift baskets, but she was also using a business strategy for Uniquely Nia, a novel enterprise for a young woman with autism. Janyska is hoping businesses will find her gift baskets appealing enough to buy them for clients.</br></br>Janyska wants to be able work out of her Linthicum home in northern Anne Arundel County, and she has already thought about how to spend her earnings. "Buy ice cream, buy some candy, buy some snacks," she said. "I want to go to Disney World if there's not too many people [and it's] not too crowded."</br></br>Until recently, even the experts would have doubted that people with autism could become successful entrepreneurs. But Janyska and a handful of others with developmental disabilities are trying to do just that in a three-year-old program in Anne Arundel and Howard counties. If successful, the program could become a model for other jurisdictions in Maryland -- and an economic prospect for the developmentally disabled, many of whom face a lifetime of unemployment or underemployment.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices declined yesterday amid concern that the dollar's sharp decline in foreign exchange trading may keep the Federal Reserve System from easing credit conditions further.</br></br>Until recently, many analysts were predicting that the Fed soon would push interest rates lower in an attempt to stimulate economic activity. Now some contend the Fed will wait, hoping the dollar's drop will revive the nation's beleaguered manufacturing industries by making exports cheaper and imports more expensive.</br></br>The Fed's policy-making arm, known as the Federal Open Market Committee, yesterday concluded a two-day meeting to establish credit strategy for the weeks ahead. Also on the committee's agenda was a review of the Fed's money supply targets for this year and the setting of new ones for 1986.</br></br>Fed officials declined to comment on what actions the committee took. But some details of the meeting are to be disclosed next Wednesday, when Paul Volcker, Reserve Board chairman, is scheduled to testify at a congressional hearing.</br></br>Prices of some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell yesterday by about 1/2 point, or approximately $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Most short-term interest rates edged higher.
r.;- Any day now, youï¿½Ûªll be heading about the twenty-fifth anniversary of the great stock market crash. On Wednesday, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½^October 23, 1929, industrial prices fell 6 percent.

That was the prelude. .</br></br>*>!J-The -next day became known as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Black Thursday.ï¿½Û Volume hit more than 12 million ï¿½ï¿½shares, then an all-time record.

Polish President Lech Walesa recently asked President Bush for a four-year, $1 billion housing loan guarantee, but administration officials said the uncertainty surrounding Poland's reform efforts and political and economic pressures on the United States make approval unlikely for some time.</br></br>Walesa wants to borrow money to help Poland carry out a massive privatization of its state-owned housing stock. Poland's new finance minister, Andrzej Olechowski, completed talks in Washington yesterday with U.S. and international financial authorities during which he said Poland intends to present a more detailed plan for the housing program to both the United States and Europe in the future.</br></br>Olechowski's more immediate mission was to reassure nervous Western financial institutions about Poland's commitment to economic reform and control of its budget deficit. Poland faces the loss of several billion dollars in Western loans and grants unless it meets an International Monetary Fund (IMF) demand to reduce its budget deficit to 5 percent or less of the country's national output.</br></br>Olechowski told reporters yesterday he had received IMF backing for a revised budget plan that envisions new taxes and spending cuts to hold the deficit down. He said the IMF will send a delegation to Warsaw next month to work on "reactivation" of the Polish program and help with continued debt relief from the West.</br></br>Olechowski said he was repeatedly reminded by U.S. officials and international financial experts of the need for more rapid structural change in Poland, particularly privatization.
CORPORATE PROFITS surged in the third quarter, reflecting cost-cutting efforts. A Wall Street Journal survey shows that 597 major companies' earnings rose a cumulative 24% from the 1992 period, a sharp acceleration from the 11% gain in the second quarter. But even though some profits were stellar and most exceeded expectations, analysts now worry that companies may have trouble sustaining the recent strong pace of growth.</br></br>Consumer spending rose 0.3% in September even though personal income gained only 0.1%. The trend is making many economists very upbeat about the recovery's strength.</br></br>---</br></br>Kmart agreed to sell its PayLess drugstores unit for $1 billion to the investment firm that controls Thrifty stores, and is in talks to sell many of its Pace warehouse clubs to rival WalMart, people close to the talks said.</br></br>---
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Use of stock-options contracts to hedge stock portfolios and speculate in the market is surging, pushing options trading to levels not seen since the 1987 stock-market crash.</br></br>Investor wariness as the Dow Jones Industrial Average continues to set records has helped bring new life to this previously moribund sector of the U.S. financial markets, as has the protracted takeover battle for Paramount Communications Inc.</br></br>"This long, drawn-out tender offer has proven to be very profitable for the options business," said Michael Schwartz, senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. "But there also has been a steady turnaround in the business, with an influx of new users and a change of direction from index options to equity options."</br></br>Many participants attending the Chicago Board Options Exchange convention here this weekend are wondering how long the nation's four major options exchanges can maintain their momentum.</br></br>Before last month, when these markets posted their highest daily and monthly volume totals in more than five years, the consensus in the U.S. options industry was that it had never really recovered from the crash. Thousands of overly aggressive investors, who used options contracts in risky, leveraged trading strategies, had been devastated in the 1987 cataclysm. And options trading fell sharply in the years that followed.
The former head of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International's American operations testified yesterday that bank officials considered First American Bankshares Inc. an integral part of BCCI's U.S. operations and regularly shared strategic, operational and marketing information with the Washington bank and its former president, Robert A. Altman.</br></br>"As far as we were concerned, inside BCC Group, this was one entity," the former executive, Abdur R. Sakhia, said of BCCI and First American at a hearing of the Senate subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations. "It was one and the same thing, because First American was owned by BCCI."</br></br>Among other things, he said, Altman participated in meetings in which BCCI proposed to secretly buy a bank in Florida through First American in 1986 using the same plans and "model agreements" it had earlier used to allegedly secretly purchase Independence Bank of Encino, Calif. The Florida transaction never took place, however.</br></br>Altman and Clifford's attorney, Robert S. Bennett, denied that a secret takeover of a Florida bank was contemplated and said Sakhia must have misunderstood the situation.</br></br>Sakhia also testified that BCCI made payoffs to foreign leaders around the world in exchange for influence, although he offered few specifics beyond a payment to officials of Zimbabwe in which he indirectly participated. He did not, however, dispute the subcommittee chairman, Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), when Kerry asserted that Sakhia had told the subcommittee staff that former Pakistani President Mohammed Zia ul-Hag and the family of former Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi received money from BCCI.
NEW YORK. July 14 W The Stock Market suffered its worst drop of the year today as a revolution in Iraq caused general selling.</br></br>International oils were hardest hit, ending with losses running from SI to about S4 a share. Other sections of the list recorded smaller losses.</br></br>Trading was fairly active with volume for the day amounting to 2.540,000 shares compared with 2,400,000 Friday.</br></br>NEW YORK, July 14 <#> United States Government bonds dropped sharply in quiet trading today as a result of the pro-Nasser coup in Iraq. Losses ranged out to 1% points among some of the recent issues.</br></br>Corporate securities were lower on balance in a day of lackluster trading. Utilities and industrials were sharply lower, while rails, investment quality issues and foreign dollar bonds shaded higher.
Rates on 30-year mortgages fell below the 6 percent level this week for the first time in three months, but economists said they don't expect rates to stay that low for long.</br></br>Freddie Mac said Thursday in its weekly nationwide survey that rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 5.98 percent this week, down from 6 percent last week. The rate was the lowest since late April, when 30-year rates averaged 5.94 percent.</br></br>Since peaking at a high for this year of 6.34 percent in mid- May, 30-year mortgage rates have been headed lower, reflecting in part a slowdown in economic activity in June.</br></br>The economy hit what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday termed a "soft patch" in June. Greenspan, however, in delivering the Fed's mid-year economic forecast to Congress, sought to allay fears that the slowdown could threaten the sustainability of the recovery. He predicted that growth would soon rebound even as the Fed proceeds with what Greenspan indicated should be a gradual pace of rate increases.</br></br>Frank Nothaft, chief economist at Freddie Mac, said that the Fed's outlook for the second half of this year was "more upbeat than expected," and he said this stronger growth will translate into further increases in mortgage rates and other interest rates set by financial markets along with the rise in short-term rates controlled by the Fed. "However, the rise in mortgage rates will be measured, not extreme, and that will help keep the housing industry stable and affordable in the coming months," he said.
A sharp jump in farm prices sent April wholesale prices soaring to their highest monthly rate, 0.8 per cent, since October, the Department of Labor reported yesterday.	economy	despite	a substan-</br></br>Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said that nearly all the April increase was due to farm and food prices. He said that since data were collected for the April wholesale price index, food prices have ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½stabilized.ï¿½Û</br></br>Wholesale prices are prices businesses charge other businesses, but changes in wholesale prices are often a precursor of eventual changes in the prices consumers pay.</br></br>Even though wholesale price increases are adjusted to account for regular seasonal variations, food prices lend to jump around more readily in response to temporary factors than industrial prices. As a result, economists look more carefully,at industrial prices because they have a longer-lasting impact on the overall price level.</br></br>Nevertheless, the 0.8 per cent wholesale price rise last month, which works out to an annual increase of 10 per cent, stands in contrast to the prior five months, when wholesale prices rose little or, as in January and February, fell.
NEW YORK, April 25 (ï¿½)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Moderate demand for railroads and motors helped to brace the stock market today, but at the close it was thoroughly mixed and leaning lower.</br></br>Corporate news continued to pour in, and many stocks certainly were influenced on an individual basis. There was no overriding news to influence the market as a whole, however, and it showed it.</br></br>The statistics tell the story rather well. The Associated Press average of 60 stocks was off 10 cents at $187.90. That was a result of a loss of 50 cents in the industrial component, a gain of 50 cents in the rails, while the utilities backed down 30 cents.</br></br>There were only 1160 individual issues traded, narrowest market in nearly eight weeks. Business amounted to 2,270,000 shares as compared with 2,500,000 shares traded in yesterdayï¿½Ûªs lower market.</br></br>Pennsylvania Railroad was the dayï¿½Ûªs most active issue up % at 27 on 58,700 shares. Directors raised the dividend to 35 cents from 25 cents quarterly.
For more than two decades, Fort Dupont Dwellings has housed more rats, snakes and crack addicts than tenants, and Stoddert Terrace has been a haven for drug dealing, crime and violence. No one seemed to care, residents said.</br></br>But the Sept. 25 shooting of a 4-year-old girl at Weatherless School in Greenway has focused attention on the community one block off East Capitol Street in Southeast Washington.</br></br>The residents in this area say city officials have not heeded their cries for help, and community leaders say they have been unable to push for change because of their own internal disputes.</br></br>Local leaders say they are ready to put aside their differences. Homeowners say they plan to reach out more to renters, and city officials say they are standing by with resources to make it all come together.</br></br>"Citizen participation is essential," said D.C. Council member Kevin P. Chavous (D-Ward 7). "The only way the government will respond is if they know the people have reached a point in which they are fed up."
The Senate yesterday approved a bill that could pave the way for the most comprehensive overhaul of federal banking law in 50 years, giving banks and securities firms broad authority to venture into each others' businesses.</br></br>The legislation, which passed by a vote of 94 to 2, would gradually tear down barriers between banks and securities firms and force banks and other financial service companies to spell out in simple English the costs and potential interest income of checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit and other products banks sell to the public.</br></br>The obstacle to the banking legislation has been the House, where opponents in the securities and the savings-and-loan industries have had a powerful ally in House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand J. St Germain (D-R.I.). Although the Senate passed banking deregulation legislation once before, in 1984, the House has never done so.</br></br>However, a growing block of House Democrats is attempting to bypass St Germain, seeking support for legislation similar to the Senate-passed package.</br></br>Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, which has jurisdiction over securities law, is allowing himself "to be dragged kicking and screaming" to the side of those supporting the Senate legislation, sources said. Dingell has been opposed to banking deregulation in the past.
WASHINGTON -- With the collapse of the international oil cartel, Saudi Arabia is rapidly exhausting the wealth it accumulated during the 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. officials, international monetary officials and private analysts here.</br></br>The Saudis have been running down their international reserves for the past three years, spending roughly half of the nation's accumulated wealth, according to one estimate. Reserves are expected to continue to dwindle this year, as the nation suffers a double blow from lower oil prices, which cut oil export earnings, and lower interest rates, which reduce earnings on overseas investments.</br></br>Precise data on the decline in the international reserves of Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern oil-producing nations is closely guarded. "These are almost like family kingdoms, and they get surprised if you ask them about these things," says Vahan Zanoyan, director of the Middle East Economic Service run by Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. "They'll say, 'Do I ask you what you have in your savings account?'"</br></br>But estimates by Mr. Zanoyan suggest that Saudi Arabia's liquid and semiliquid assets at the end of last year had dropped to about $55 billion from about $110 billion in early 1983. And Mr. Zanoyan says the assets will fall an additional $15 billion this year.</br></br>"They are faced with a choice," said Robert Hormats, vice president for international finance at Goldman, Sachs & Co. "They can either eat into their reserves, or they can substantially cut back development and consumption. The effect will be quite substantial any way you look at it."
CONSUMER SPENDING jumped 0.9% for the second straight month in July, more than double the modest 0.4% rise in personal income. The pattern continued to defy economists' predictions of slower spending. Some analysts cautioned that the higher spending bodes ill for the nation's massive trade deficit.</br></br>Oil prices dipped near $18 a barrel and ended at a four-month low on reports of OPEC overproduction. Meanwhile, several big U.S. oil companies lowered the price they pay for the leading grade of domestic crude.</br></br>U.S. oil and gas drilling has risen from last year's depressed level despite lower petroleum prices.</br></br>---</br></br>The dollar closed mixed after Japan reportedly moved to boost the currency but failed to follow through later in the day. Worry about the dollar's slide sent the Dow Jones industrials down 12.43 to 2697.07 as bonds edged lower.
Global investors spent another day dumping many of the world's most high-priced technology stocks, though by the end of the day there were nascent signs that the selling pressure may be about to ease.</br></br>Much of the selling came in reaction to the Nasdaq Stock Market's 4.1% decline Tuesday, and many analysts believe technology shares globally will remain volatile until the U.S. technology barometer finds traction. The Nasdaq closed down yesterday an additional 2.6%.</br></br>Still, the blue-chip technology stocks in Japan that ignited this week's global selloff appear to have found their footing again with two straight days of gains. Other Asian markets, meanwhile, managed to bounce off their lows and close with minor losses.</br></br>"I think the pullback will be shortlived," said Robert Reiner, portfolio manager at Deutsche Asset Management in New York. "There is still a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to get in."</br></br>In Europe, technology, media and telecom declines dragged down the broader markets, but investors showed selective interest in some Old Economy industrial stocks. Latin American stocks edged higher.
NEW YORK -- Currency traders may be in for a bumpy ride this week as serious questions about interest rates, European Union and global trade bombard the market.</br></br>Market participants face a host of U.S. economic indicators that hold clues on the outlook for U.S. interest rates. What's more, Italy's chances of participating in Europe's single currency plan from the start hang in the balance as the country tries to put together a temporary government that can pass its 1998 budget. Meantime, U.S.-Japanese trade tensions have resurfaced in force, beating the dollar back below 120.00 yen.</br></br>Late Friday in New York the dollar was quoted at 1.7485 marks, up from 1.7435 marks late Thursday in New York. The U.S. currency also was quoted at 119.85 yen, down from 121.14 yen. Sterling fell to $1.6215 from $1.6244. About noon Monday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 120.23 yen and at 1.7508 marks.</br></br>"There isn't a [market] trend at this point. It's more just a matter of being reactive," said Scott Pardee, a senior adviser at Yamaichi International America in New York.</br></br>The renewed expectation of higher rates in the U.S. should lend some support to the dollar, especially if data on prices, sales and production slated for release this week provide Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan with ammunition to follow up on his intimations of higher rates.
Even though wavering U.S. stock and job markets gave consumers the jitters during the summer, they kept spending freely on cars and housing, and a new consumer-spending index produced by Deloitte Research helps to explain why.</br></br>Carl Steidtmann, Deloitte's chief economist, says economists spend too much time watching wiggles in monthly consumer-confidence measures -- which have recently slipped -- to try to gauge the outlook for spending. The more important indicator of the outlook for spending, he says, is long-term trends in the actual cash going into and out of people's pocketbooks. His index of cash flow is pointing up -- thanks to factors such as tax cuts, wage gains and increases in home prices -- suggesting that spending could strengthen, at least for the next few months.</br></br>"Consumers are wallowing in cash," says Mr. Steidtmann. Deloitte Research is a unit of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, an accounting and consulting partnership.</br></br>Data released by the government Friday underscored this argument. The University of Michigan said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell in August to 87.6 from 88.1 in July. A separate measure of confidence produced by the Conference Board was also down in August.</br></br>But consumer spending picked up after slowing down during the spring. In July, consumption rose 1% from the previous month, the Commerce Department said, largely because of a new outburst of spending on cars backed by 0% financing deals. Spending in July grew at a 6.7% annual rate from the second quarter, according to calculations by UBS Warburg.
Sharp increases in global commodity prices are beginning to push consumer prices higher in Asia, boosting the odds that inflation will be exported to the U.S. and elsewhere in the months ahead.</br></br>Consumer prices had been holding fairly steady, or even declining, in much of Asia in recent years, as the region's economies worked off excess capacity amid the global downturn. But as Asia heats up again, price pressures are building, in large part because of China's ravenous appetite for raw materials. Oil prices have shot up and are hovering around $35 a barrel, while the prices of other raw materials, including scrap steel and copper, are double or more what they were just 18 months ago.</br></br>As a result, consumer price inflation, while still extremely low in Asia by historical standards, has accelerated in recent months. The most significant turnaround has occurred in China. That country's inflation rate, though easing slightly in February, has jumped in recent months, including a 3.2% surge in January, compared with the year before. That comes after prices were nearly flat or declining through much of 2002 and 2003.</br></br>Price increases are also cropping up in some of the region's other major economies. In Japan and Hong Kong, for example, it appears that a long stretch of price deflation may be coming to an end, as consumers are now paying more for some goods. In South Korea, the higher prices have been particularly pronounced among exporters, as domestic consumer demand remains slack. The pattern of rising prices is even more evident in Thailand and the Philippines.</br></br>"We're kind of at a turning point" in consumer prices in Asia, says Rob Subbaraman, a regional economist at Lehman Brothers in Tokyo. "Broad inflationary pressures are beginning to build."
High unemployment persists across the country despite the spring pickup in business, a Labor Department report showed yesterday.</br></br>In mid-July, 89 major job] centers were classed as suffering from ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½substantial labor surplus,ï¿½Û with 6 percent, or more of their labor force] out of work. This was an increase of three metropolitan areas since mid-May and was the largest total since the classification system began operating seven years ago.</br></br>The other 60 big areas all had "'3 per cent or more idled aryl were listed as having a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½agpderateï¿½Û labor surplus, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½he report is worrisome because seasonal shifts are eliminated in determining the category in which a city is to be placed. Therefore, the June influx of job-seeking; students did not distortf this picture as it did the over-all unemployment report in June.</br></br>Moreover, cities were tagged as high-unemployment centers only if there was prospect of little change through September.</br></br>In mid-June, total unemployment was figured at 5.4 mil: lion and the seasonally adjusted rate at 6.8 per cent.
So thick has been the marijuana smoke, and so myopic is Washington about Reagan's recent misadventures, that people have not noticed the extent to which the lame duck is limping across a political landscape he has shaped to his liking- Furthermore, proof that Reaganï¿½Ûªs reservoir of luck has not run dry is this: Oct. 19, "Black Monday,ï¿½Û may help economic expansion continue past the 1988 election.</br></br>Republicans may remember it as Glittering Monday. The stock market plunge was caused, in part, by a surge in interest rates. The surge was driven, in part, by inflationary expectations. They were washed away, at least for the moment, on Oct. 19, and the washing made possible a freshet of money creation by the Fed.</br></br>Capitalismï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and therefore civilization as we know itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½depends on the annual Christmas shopping binge, now beginning. The stock market has not yet had a significant depressing effect on consumer spending, on which two-thirds of economic activity depends. In the automotive sector, anxieties produced by Wall Street, combined with the decline of the dollar and interest rates, have primarily hurt expensive foreign imports. Puppies (previously upwardly mobile persons) are thinking about the unthinkableï¿½ï¿½ï¿½driving a domestic car.</br></br>The sobriety induced by the stock market shock will help Reagan resist a protectionist trade bill and has put even Social Security on the agenda, at least for a while, in deficit-reduction negotiations. Here is a measure of the rightward ratchet of the Reagan years: on the eve of an election. Congress has at least considered two difficult choices.</br></br>One is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½CPI minus twoï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½limiting cost-of-living increases to two percentage points less than the increase in the consumer price index. An even better idea is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½two years, two percent.ï¿½Û The policy regarding COLAs for Social Security and military and other pensions, and all federal pay increases, would be: for two years everyone gets two percent, but only that. Everyoneï¿½Ûªs ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sacrificeï¿½Û would be a slightly smaller increase. Assuming economic growth of 2.5 to 2.8 percentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½an optimistic but not unreasonable assumptionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Reagan
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the central bank's plan to buy government bonds during a private gathering with U.S. senators, responding to several days of attacks from Republicans who say the Fed is causing inflation and weakening the dollar.</br></br>The Fed chairman denied the U.S. was manipulating the currency through its plan to purchase $600 billion of U.S. Treasury bonds and pointed to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston which estimated the program could create 700,000 to one million jobs over two years.</br></br>Sen. Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, said he "wasn't persuaded" and noted that "even some Fed officials have doubts" about the central bank program. GOP lawmakers said in a letter to Mr. Bernanke released Wednesday that the Fed's move "introduces significant uncertainty regarding the future strength of the dollar and could result. . .in hard-to-control, long-term inflation."</br></br>In a sign of divisions within conservative political circles about the Fed, Tom Donohue, head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a frequent ally of Republicans, came out in support of Mr. Bernanke. Mr. Donohue said Mr. Bernanke had "acted in a very important way" to help economic growth and warned lawmakers "not to louse that up."</br></br>Evan Bayh (D., Ind.) said the Fed chief told lawmakers the central bank was "absolutely committed" to stable inflation.
Banks are tightening lending standards for businesses and consumers -- even beyond real-estate loans -- and companies' demand for credit has weakened, a new Federal Reserve survey of senior bank-loan officers shows.</br></br>The January survey offers the hardest evidence yet that the credit crunch is spreading. Although banks also reported some tightening of lending requirements on credit cards and other consumer loans, commercial and industrial loans have been the most severely affected.</br></br>One-third of the U.S. banks and about two-thirds of the foreign banks responding told the Fed they had tightened lending standards on commercial and industrial loans during the three months ended Jan. 31. About half the banks said they have widened the spread between their cost of funds and what they are charging borrowers.</br></br>"Bankers are becoming more cautious," said Keith Leggett, economist at the American Bankers Association in Washington, "but also borrowers are getting more cautious."</br></br>About a third of the banks participating in the survey reported weaker demand for commercial and industrial loans, while about one in 10 reported strong demand. Among those that saw a reduced appetite for loans, "a decrease in customers' needs to finance inventories and investment in plant and equipment" was cited frequently. Additionally, 70% of the respondents cited a drop in businesses' needs for merger- and-acquisition financing as a reason for lower demand.
IF WE CAN just get by this recession, economic pep leaders assure us, a big boom stretches indefinitely ahead. The basis	for	this is babiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and more</br></br>Just let the war babies of the 1940s reach 20 or thereabouts, and thereï¿½Ûªll be another big rush	to	the altar.</br></br>offspring of these marriages will marry, and so on . and so on.,, with ever more buyers for everything.</br></br>But the tendency of marriage patterns to change may alter this picture somewhat. 'Will dating at 14 and marriage at 18 with babies by the early 20s continue fashionable indefinitely? Or will economic factors or changes in modesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and moodsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½of romance set young people to marrying later, and perhaps having later and fewer children?</br></br>The postwar marriage and baby boom seems to.be ending. The marriage rate has been dropping for at least six months and a deficiency in births as compared with the year before, has existed since last November.
Antiwar activists are gearing up for a march on Washington on Saturday, the latest for a global peace movement that has mobilized with increasing frequency as the nation prepares for a war with Iraq.</br></br>In Burke, psychologist Suzanne Doherty, 56, has worked to assemble a squad of grandmothers to join her on Saturday. "This is not exclusively a young person's movement," said Doherty, founder of the Northern Virginia chapter of Grandmothers for Peace.</br></br>In Philadelphia, Betsy Payet has taken an avalanche of calls from protesters looking for seats on 20 charter buses. "The people in this so-called democracy are being ignored," she said.</br></br>And in Princeton, N.J., the Rev. Robert Moore has helped fill a five-bus caravan of homemakers, students and retirees. "They realize that this is our last best chance to try to avert a war," said Moore, 52, pastor of two United Church of Christ congregations.</br></br>The demonstration is part of a loose-knit local, national and global campaign to oppose the use of military force to disarm Iraq. The march and rally are part of an effort that will stage simultaneous rallies in San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as in other nations.
NEW YORK -- Until last week, Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. had been expecting a recession in the first half of this year. "A slump is still possible," he says, "but now we feel more comfortable with a muddling-through scenario."</br></br>Mr. Yardeni had been more pessimistic than most economists; few analysts expected an actual recession this year. But many forecasters are beginning to wonder if their earlier predictions weren't a shade too gloomy. Recent statistics -- notably, employment, new orders and industrial production -- indicate the new year may be getting off to a faster-than-expected start.</br></br>"The strong employment gains in January show that the economic rebound has developed a good deal of momentum," says Sam Nakagama, a New York-based economic consultant. Non-farm payroll employment rose a sharp 448,000 last month after increasing 225,000 in December.</br></br>Robert Genetski, an economist at Chicago's Harris Trust & Savings Bank, says, "The latest economic numbers show a burst of activity toward year end. In the final three months of the year, industrial production, personal income and wages and salaries rose at close to a 6% annual rate. Perhaps of greater significance is the surge in manufacturers' new orders, which suggests future strength. In December these orders, excluding defense, jumped 10% from their levels of last summer and fall."</br></br>Mr. Genetski expects the inflation-adjusted gross national product to grow at a 3.6% annual rate in the current quarter, a sharp rise from the 1.7% rate in the fourth quarter. Other factors influencing Mr. Genetski and other optimists: rapid growth of the money supply, a belief that the trade deficit will continue to shrink, and the help that higher oil prices will give the U.S. oil industry.
South Korea's newly elected president, Kim Dae Jung, fought a losing battle today to bolster the confidence of financial markets, which fell sharply amid fears that he will bend to labor unions and other domestic political pressures rather than instituting tough economic reform measures.</br></br>Despite repeated assurances from Kim and his aides, who said the president-elect intends to comply fully with economic reform guidelines set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the South Korean stock market dropped 5.1 percent and the South Korean currency, the won, fell as much as 11 percent before closing down 4.5 percent.</br></br>"It will take all the wisdom {we have} to restore the economic situation," said Kim's chief of staff, Jay Yoo. "It will take some time. We'll work together with foreign investors and the IMF. I don't know how long it will take."</br></br>Traders and business leaders said they were worried because Kim initially balked at the terms of the IMF's $57 billion bailout of South Korea, even though he later muted his criticism and declared his full support for the guidelines.</br></br>On his first day as president-elect, Kim tried hard to dispel doubts about his determination to tackle South Korea's tough economic problems that include a weak banking system, inefficient industrial conglomerates and a foreign debt crisis threatening to strangle the world's 11th-largest economy.
WASHINGTON -- The American shopper, the economy's chief engine these days, kept spending at a decent clip last month, though the General Motors Corp. strike damped overall retail sales.</br></br>Sales for all retailers fell 0.4% in July from June, adjusting for seasonal factors but not for inflation, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. That was the worst performance in more than a year, and reversed a modest 0.1% rise in June.</br></br>But the weakness was almost entirely at auto dealerships, which saw sales plunge 3% for the month, following a 0.6% rise in June. Analysts blamed the drop largely on the now-ended GM walkout: Excluding cars, retailers saw a decent 0.5% rise in business, more than making up for June's 0.1% decline in noncar sales.</br></br>Consumers' spending predilections have taken on a heightened importance in keeping the economic expansion going, as the Asian crisis has forced a slowdown in manufacturing and threatened to curb business investment. Despite daily news of Asia's deterioration, though, American consumer confidence remains high.</br></br>"The consumer is continuing to carry the load for the economy," said Joel Naroff, an economist at First Union Capital Markets Group in Philadelphia.
The persistent shortage of workers that has been crimping growth plans at many companies won't be ending anytime soon, according to Manpower Inc.'s latest survey of U.S. employers' hiring plans.</br></br>Demand for employees is still growing, and with unemployment at its current extremely low levels, "the traditional labor supply is essentially exhausted," Manpower said.</br></br>Companies pinched for labor may get a modicum of relief from recent legislative changes that eliminated Social Security earning limits; that freed some older workers from restrictions on their ability to work. But recruiting more workers "will continue to challenge employers throughout the country," Manpower said.</br></br>Of the about 16,000 companies that participated in the survey, about 35% said they expect to be recruiting additional workers in the third quarter.</br></br>That's the highest level seen in the 24 years that the survey has been conducted. During the year-earlier quarter, and again in the second quarter of the current year, the figure was an already very strong 32%.
NEW YORK -- Crude-oil futures rose to a three-week high, bolstered by restored confidence in the global economic recovery and the potential interruption of crude imports to the U.S. Gulf Coast by a huge oil spill.</br></br>Light, sweet crude for June delivery gained 98 cents, or 1.2%, to settle at $86.15 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, just below the 2010 settlement high of $86.84 a barrel on April 6. It gained 2.9% for April, its third consecutive monthly rise.</br></br>Oil rose as the dollar continued to back off a one-year high against the euro hit Wednesday. The euro rose after Greece accepted new austerity measures as a condition of getting aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund.</br></br>Investors also were encouraged by a 3.2% expansion in first-quarter U.S. gross domestic product.</br></br>While slightly below the consensus forecast, the increase was fueled by stronger consumer spending, a positive indicator for future growth.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warned that intensifying credit and financial-market pressures are likely to restrain economic growth and left the door open for a sizable interest-rate cut next month.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke, testifying at the Senate Banking Committee, said he expects "sluggish growth" in the economy and a "somewhat stronger pace" later in the year, thanks to rate cuts and fiscal stimulus. But he cautioned that housing and labor markets could deteriorate more than anticipated, emphasizing that "downside risks to growth remain."</br></br>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, at the same hearing, said the government's recent actions -- including the $168 billion economic- stimulus package and efforts to modify homeowners' mortgages -- would help soften the housing-market correction. But he warned that "those programs alone will not be sufficient . . . . It's going to take time and some pain before we work through this." Mr. Paulson urged action on legislation to overhaul the Federal Housing Administration and government-sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and, in response to questions, said the administration is willing to consider other housing-related proposals.</br></br>The Federal Reserve has slashed the target for its benchmark federal-funds rate to 3% from 5.25% last summer. Futures markets expect the Fed to lower interest rates half a point March 18. Traders put one-in-three odds on a three-quarter percentage point cut. The market odds remained largely unchanged yesterday by Mr. Bernanke's testimony.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke, who is likely to elaborate on the Fed's views when he delivers his semiannual report to Congress later this month, said market worries about mortgage defaults and the ripple effects of bond insurers' woes are contributing to tighter lending standards. "More- expensive and less-available credit seems likely to continue to be a source of restraint on economic growth," Mr. Bernanke said. Declining home values and a softening labor market -- along with higher energy costs and lower equity prices -- are likely to affect consumer spending, he added.
Struggling to balance Virginia's budget despite soaring health care costs for the poor, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder last week made a spicy proposal buried beneath a bland name.</br></br>"Shared Provider Financial Participation" is Wilder's bulky euphemism for the tax he wants to impose on most of the medical industry to help offset the state's growing spending on the federally mandated Medicaid program.</br></br>Just a few days into the 1992 General Assembly session, the Medicaid proposal already has emerged as one of the year's biggest battles. A high-stakes contest is underway pitting Wilder's legislative influence against some of the state's most powerful interest groups.</br></br>Wilder's plan would raise $68 million during the next two-year budget cycle by taxing from one-half percent to 1 percent of the gross receipts of hospitals, nursing homes and pharmacies, and putting a $200 annual surcharge on physicians.</br></br>Wilder and his advisers argue that the health care providers can absorb the tax by making their operations more efficient and modestly pinching profits. Proponents of the tax say health care profits are high in part because of rapidly escalating Medicaid payments that, unlike most state government programs, are adjusted upward to account for inflation.
President Reagan, unable to meet his goal of cutting the federal deficit in half over three years, has essentially talked away from the problem, leaving to Congress the politically unpalatable choices on defense, taxes and Social Security.</br></br>What his senior officials hoped would be a fresh start this year with dramatic, early leadership by Reagan to trim the deficitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½similar to months ago but now moribund, of cutting the deficit to $100 billion by 1988. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Our budget is finished, and there is no way of reopening it.ï¿½Û Reagan dominated the budget debate in his first year, but since</br></br>then he has increasingly pushed the hard choices over to Congress, delivering budgets that congressional leaders called ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½dead on arrival." Reagan has then let them forge a compromise and take the blame for it. Reagan often endorsed the bitter pill of these compromisesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½higher taxes and less defense spending than he soughtï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but also rhetorically flogged Congress for not giving him what he requested.</br></br>compromise came about in the spring. But this year the process has started unfolding with unaccustomed swiftness as Senate Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) announced Friday that Senate Republicans would write their own spending blueprint by Feb. I, a few days before Reagan is due to submit his.</br></br>Reagan lost the initiative this year through a confluence of events that had origins in liis reelection campaign.

Many holders of beleaguered Qwest Communications International hope that the Denver company eventually will be taken over. But even that might not give them much cause for celebration.</br></br>Qwest's main business, wireline phone service in 14 Western states, is in serious decline, and Qwest hasn't established much of a wireless presence. The lack of a "bundled" strategy makes it hard for Qwest to add new customers and keep old ones. And although Qwest has no earnings or dividend, it's one of the costliest regional Bell operating companies based on one key financial measure, enterprise value. Consisting of stock-market value plus net debt, this stands at 6.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- versus 5.4 times for SBC Communications and 4.9 for BellSouth recently.</br></br>Another problem: Qwest, formed in 2000 from the marriage of fiber- optic telecom network Qwest and Baby Bell USWest, has been hurt by the legacy of past accounting practices that are the subject of continuing criminal probes.</br></br>Qwest has a staggering $16 billion of debt, even after reductions under new CEO Richard Notebaert. That's "going to sap a lot of free cash flow for a long time," says John Heinlein, a portfolio manager with Towson, Md., money manager Horan & Associates, who sold a Qwest position in the first quarter.</br></br>Qwest stock is below $4, down from $66 before the telecom bubble burst four years ago. Though Mr. Notebaert, former chief of Ameritech, has mounted a gallant turnaround effort, the stock has slid 25% since he arrived two years ago. "Qwest equity appears to us as barely more than an option, and an expensive one at that," Richard G. Klugman of brokerage firm Jefferies & Co. wrote in a research note. He has a price target of $2.
MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's highflying economy lost altitude quickly during last year's fourth quarter, with output here growing a modest 5.1% amid weaker growth in the U.S. Economists had expected a result closer to 6%.</br></br>Despite the late slowdown, figures released yesterday showed Mexico's economy easily beat the government's 4.5% target to grow 6.9% for the year as a whole, its fastest annual growth since 1981. The economy was helped by oil prices at a decade-high, a growing U.S. appetite for Mexican exports, and spending by Mexican consumers who enjoyed wage gains greater than price increases.</br></br>This year's outlook under new President Vicente Fox Quesada is more uncertain, thanks to a recent drop in oil prices and a fast-slowing U.S. economy, where roughly 85% of Mexican exports are sold. Industrial output for December, the latest barometer of activity, slipped slightly after double-digit growth for much of the year.</br></br>Some economists welcome a slowdown as a way to prevent prices from rising too quickly. But they note that the drop in industrial output doesn't necessarily mean that Mexicans are spending less. If spending on imports remains strong while Mexican factories export less, they note, the trade deficit could widen, weakening the currency.</br></br>"A slowdown for Mexico is inevitable," said economist Gray Newman at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "The risk is that production slows substantially and spending does not."
WASHINGTON -- President Bush's budget offers little ammunition for shooting down Sen. Daniel Moynihan's arresting proposal to cut Social Security payroll taxes by $55 billion.</br></br>Taken at face value, the New York Democrat's plan would cut taxes for the bulk of Americans -- the folks who make their money by working and who earn less than $50,000 a year. But the only alternatives in the administration budget involve a complex scheme to change Social Security accounting and a package of savings-and-investment incentives that would largely benefit upper-income Americans.</br></br>"They're talking about belches and Moynihan is talking about a tornado," says Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips, who views the Moynihan plan as a manifestation of a "new middle-class tax revolt."</br></br>The Moynihan plan -- to roll back the payroll-tax increase that took effect Jan. 1 and to cut the tax again on Jan. 1, 1991 -- would yield more than half its benefits to families with incomes below $50,000 a year, Congressional Budget Office figures indicate.</br></br>Precise estimates aren't yet available on the capital-gains tax cut and savings incentives proposed by the president. But families with incomes below $50,000 would get less than 10% of the benefits of either a sweetened Individual Retirement Account program, along the lines of the one proposed last year by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), or a cut in capital-gains taxes like the Bush-backed version the House passed last year, the Joint Tax Committee estimates.

NEW YORK -- Bond prices slumped yesterday after the Federal Reserve System reported an unexpectedly large increase in the nation's money supply.</br></br>Prices of some actively traded Treasury bonds fell about 1/2 point, or around $5 for each $1,000 face amount. But most short-term interest rates were little changed.</br></br>The basic money supply, known as M1, jumped $1.4 billion in the week ended Sept. 2, leaving it far above the Fed's target. The Fed also reported M1 soared at a 20.5% annual rate in August. Most analysts had expected little or no change in M1 in the Sept. 2 week.</br></br>The $1.4 billion spurt "was a major disappointment," said Elliott Platt, senior vice president and economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. The growth of money is a "definite negative" for the credit markets, he said.</br></br>With the economy showing signs of rebounding from a sluggish first-half performance, many analysts argue that the Fed may soon tighten credit conditions, pushing up interest rates, in an attempt to slow money growth. "If the economy continues to strengthen, the Fed will have to pay attention to the money supply," Mr. Platt said.
WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve policy makers unanimously decided at their Nov. 16 meeting to hold interest rates steady and to lean neither toward higher nor lower rates in the ensuing weeks, the Fed disclosed.</br></br>The Fed's policy-making open market committee met Tuesday behind closed doors, and hasn't signaled any immediate change in interest rates since then.</br></br>The summary of the November meeting, released last week after the customary lag, said Fed officials agreed "that despite various indications of a pickup in economic growth, the underlying economic situation and the outlook for inflation hadn't changed sufficiently to warrant an adjustment in monetary policy."</br></br>The Fed has been holding short-term interest rates at historically low levels since September 1992. The recent strength of the economy has sparked speculation about when the Fed will begin to move rates up.</br></br>At their November meeting, according to the 22-page summary, Fed officials reiterated their intention of "taking early action to arrest incipient inflationary pressures before they gathered strength." They said that "in appropriate circumstances, a prompt policy move" -- that is, an increase in short-term interest rates -- might allay financial market concerns about inflation and keep the bond market from pushing up long-term rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average briefly swept past 12,000 for the first time Wednesday, extending its march into record territory but falling short of the benchmark close.</br></br>The index surpassed the milestone shortly after trading began, rising as high as 12,049.51, before pulling back as the market's initial wave of enthusiasm dissipated and investors cashed in some gains.</br></br>The Dow closed Wednesday at 11,992.68, up 42.66, or 0.36 percent. The previous closing high of 11,980.60 was set Monday. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.91, or 0.14 percent, to 1365.96. The Nasdaq composite index fell 7.80, or 0.33 percent, to 2337.15.</br></br>It took the Dow 71/2 years to make the trip from 11,000, having been pummeled during that time by the dot-com bust, recession and the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In the spring of 1999, during the Internet boom, it took the Dow 24 days to sprint to 11,000 from 10,000.</br></br>The Dow's quick move past 12,000 Wednesday came after a Labor Department report indicated that consumer price pressures are leveling off and as third-quarter earnings reports from major companies bolstered investors' confidence.

How is Wall Street coping with the recession? Quite well, thank .you. Brokerage firms are enjoy-,ing record profits. And the prices of many stocks have climbed higher and higherï¿½ï¿½ï¿½even while the unemployment lines have grown longer and longer. Investors are doing fine, too, especially in mutual funds. Stock funds gained an average of 36 percent last year while bond funds rose an average of 26 percent.</br></br>Admittedly, it doesnï¿½Ûªt seem to make much sense. How can the financial markets be booming at a time when there is so much joblessness and so much distress in the business community? What is it about the behavior of the markets that turns bad news into good news?	;</br></br>Perhaps the simplest explanation, and it only scratches the surface, is that investment cycles rarely match the business cycles that bring on recessions. Indeed, the financial markets often serve as forecasting mechanisms, reflecting not what is happening today, but what investors believe will happen six months or a year from now.</br></br>Thus fir. the message of the markets is that investors are betting on a recovery that will boost the profits and the stock prices of many companies caught in the current economic slowdown.</br></br>As for Wall Streetï¿½Ûªs current prosperity, it is worth remembering that the securities business already has had its recessionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½one that essentially began with the market crash in Oct/ober 1987 and lasted for three years.
No one can complain of a shortage of information about the Great Financial Meltdown. The biggest growth industry today is words: A whole new vocabulary has spread from board tables to kitchen tables. Superannuated whiz kids planting cabbages to offset their newly straitened means can blame their troubles on collateralized debt obligations, special investment vehicles, credit default swaps. Subprime mortgage holders find themselves censured for a new and virulent disease called toxic debt.</br></br>But what is in even shorter supply than credit is an economic theory to explain why this financial tsunami occurred, and what its consequences might be. Over the past 30 years, economists have devoted great intellectual energy to proving that such disasters cannot happen. The market system accurately prices all trades at each moment in time. Greed, ignorance, euphoria, panic, herd behavior, predation, financial skulduggery and politics -- the forces that drive boom-bust cycles -- only exist offstage in their models.</br></br>The Great Financial Meltdown would not have surprised the British economist John Maynard Keynes, who died in 1946, for he thought that this was exactly how unregulated markets would behave. The New Economics, as Keynesian economics was known in the United States until it became the Obsolete Economics, was designed to prevent such turbulence. It held that governments should vary taxes and spending to offset any tendency for inflation to rise or output to fall.</br></br>The New Economics generated its own problems, causing it to collapse into stagflation in the 1970s. But for most Americans and Europeans, the years from 1950 to 1975 were a golden age. The developed world grew at an average annual rate of 3.2 percent with very moderate inflation, and without the benefit of the huge rewards now deemed necessary to keep executives properly incentivized. Above all, growth was stable. The business cycle was severely dampened.</br></br>Keynes first became convinced of the instability of unregulated economies in the boom years of the "Roaring '20s." In many ways, the 1920s were like the last 15 years in their technological dynamism, the extravagant lifestyles of the very rich and in their "irrational exuberance." But they were especially like the recent past in their belief that prosperity would continue without interruption.
THIS SERIES has described ways to address inequality: Increase tax progressivity; invest more in education; reform health care. But there's pressure to reach beyond that: to tackle inequality where it apparently originates, meaning the workplace. This pressure can be dangerous. Companies are not instruments of social policy; their first duty is to make money by serving customers, and they can provide for their workers only so long as they do that. Nevertheless, two sorts of corporate reform are warranted. It should be easier for labor unions to organize. And it should be harder for top executives to pay themselves outlandish sums.</br></br>Union membership has fallen from 20 percent of the workforce in 1980 to 13 percent in 2005, and part of this decline is inevitable. It reflects attrition in the manufacturing industries that are most easily organized. It reflects the rise of sophisticated human resource departments that provide workers with training, savings plans and grievance procedures -- usurping some of unions' traditional functions. And it reflects the deregulation of domestic industries such as trucking and airlines, plus tougher foreign competition. These forces spur businesses to innovate, but they also constrain their ability to make wage concessions to unions. In competitive markets, companies will pay workers what it takes to prevent them from being lured away by rivals -- and not more.</br></br>Yet the decline of organized labor also reflects a legal climate that is neither inevitable nor desirable. The way labor law is enforced now, employers can block attempts to establish unions by intimidating workers; a supervisor can summon an employee to daily meetings to discuss the dangers of unions or ban discussion of a union during work hours. If these tactics are not enough, employers can fire union organizers; although this is supposed to be illegal, the penalties are too feeble to serve as a deterrent. Meanwhile, a series of decisions from the National Labor Relations Board has narrowed the definition of workers who are eligible for union membership. Two months ago, for example, the three board members appointed by President Bush outvoted the two appointed by President Bill Clinton in ruling that relatively junior workers can be defined as "supervisors," thus restricting their right to join a union.</br></br>A fairer legal climate might reduce inequality slightly. According to David Card of the University of California at Berkeley, de-unionization explains about 15 percent of the increase in wage inequality among men over the past quarter-century. But the larger gain from reforming labor law would be political. Freedom of association is a core democratic right, and polls suggest that between 30 and 50 percent of nonunion workers would choose union representation if they had a chance to vote for it. The suppression of freedom of association is wrong in itself, and it fosters the suspicion that the rules of the economy are rigged against workers. Setting aside the debate over how much union membership can improve wages or benefits, the option of union membership is crucial to the legitimacy of capitalism.</br></br>The same goes for rules on executive compensation. Since 1970, the pay of chief executives has jumped from less than 30 times the average wage to almost 300 times that level. This helps explain why the richest 1 percent of Americans pocketed 21.6 percent of all the gains in national income between 1996 and 2001, according to Ian Dew- Becker of the National Bureau of Economic Research and Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University. As with the decline of labor unions, some of the rise in executive compensation reflects market forces and is inevitable. Yet similar market forces are at work in other advanced nations, where executive pay has grown more modestly. In 2003, the ratio of U.S. chief executives' pay to that of manufacturing workers was more than double the norm in 13 other rich countries.
The nationï¿½Ûªs industrial output rose 0.4 per cent in April, the first rise in five months, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday.</br></br>The Fed said the industrial production index, which meas-j ures the output of the nationï¿½Ûªs factories, mines and utilities, rose to 124.7 per cent of the 1907 average, a level just 0.5, per cent above a year earlier.</br></br>The April increase, following declines of 0.6 per cent ini February and 0.3 per cent in i March, was attributed prima-: rily to gains in industries producing automobiles, business equipment and durable goods materials.</br></br>Industrial production is a key indicator of the nationï¿½Ûªs"; economic health.

In the first three quarters of 1996, Canada's unemployment rate averaged 9.6%, while the U.S. rate was only 5.4%. In fact, every year since 1981, Canada's unemployment rate has exceeded the U.S. rate. The gap averaged 2.1 percentage points between 1981 and 1989, and has risen to an average of 3.8 percentage points in the 1990s.</br></br>This widening gap worries many Canadian politicians and citizens. The highest annual U.S. unemployment rate since 1941 was 9.7% in 1982, during the depths of the 1981-82 recession. But Canada is not in a recession. Although growth is slow, real output between 1989 and 1996 grew an average of 1.5% per year. So why is unemployment so much higher in Canada than in the U.S.?</br></br>One cause, you might suspect, lies in how the Canadian and U.S. governments measure unemployment. In Canada, passive job searchers, those who look for a job only by consulting the want ads, are counted as unemployed. In the U.S., you have to be actively searching to be classified as unemployed. But this definitional difference, according to economist Jay Zagorsky of the Center for Human Resource Research at Ohio State University, can account for only 0.7 percentage points of the 4.2-point difference.</br></br>Also, many U.S. residents who might be counted as unemployed under the Canadian definition are in prison. The much higher U.S. incarceration rate, though, still can account for only about 0.2 percentage points of the 4.2-point gap. Moreover, notes Andrew Sharpe of the Ottawa-based Centre for the Study of Living Standards, if you count as "half-unemployed" part-time workers who would rather work full-time, the difference between Canadian and U.S. unemployment rates widens by about 1.5 percentage points.</br></br>An obvious suspect when trying to explain high unemployment is a country's system of unemployment insurance. The more valuable the benefits, the longer they last and the easier they are to qualify for, the greater the unemployment rate, all other things equal. The reason: People have an incentive to stay unemployed and to be very choosy about the jobs they will accept when they are subsidized to stay at home. Canada's unemployment insurance system became much more expensive in 1972 when Pierre Trudeau's government increased the benefits' value and duration, and decreased the period required to qualify.
The Federal Reserve Board yesterday approved Citicorpï¿½Ûªs application to establish a limited-purpose bank in Towson, Md., while Chase Manhattan Bank announced that it filed an application to set up a so-called nonbank bank at Tysons Comer.</br></br>Citicorp, the nationï¿½Ûªs largest bank company, filed the application for the Towson bank last year under a Maryland law that permits out-of-state banks to set up facilities that are restricted from competing with Maryland banks. The bank will offer consumer credit products and credit cards on a nationwide basis and also will accept checking accounts and make commercial loans.</br></br>The proposed Chase facility in Virginia was one of nine applications New Yorkï¿½Ûªs second-biggest bank company filed with the comptroller of the currency to set up banking facilities. Earlier, Chase had filed applications for 16 other nonbank banks.</br></br>The nonbank banks are designed to get around federal laws that prohibit banks from setting up operations in other states. To be a bank under that law, an institution must offer checking accounts and make commercial loans. While most banks are trying to set up consumer institutions that make no commercial loans, Chase wants to establish facilities that make business loans but do not accept checking accounts.</br></br>The number of jobless Virginians dropped by 14,800 in March as the stateï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent, down six-tenths of a percentage point from February, the Virginia Employment Commission said in Richmond yesterday.
Concerned that overnight interest rates could soar late this year because of fears in the financial markets of potential year-end computer glitches, the New York Federal Reserve Bank today announced a series of actions it hopes will help keep rates under control.</br></br>One step, affecting mortgage-backed securities issued by government-sponsored agencies such as Fannie Mae, could help head off a potential spike in mortgage rates.</br></br>A number of financial analysts said the changes would help the markets function more smoothly as the new year approaches. Meanwhile, the announcement had an immediate impact on some types of securities that mature in December or January. In one instance, the interest rate on a type of contract committing someone to make money available in December fell by more than a quarter of a percentage point, which underscored the level of apprehension in the market.</br></br>"This is a doozy," said F. Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial-markets research firm. "The Fed is pulling out all the stops to both calm market anxieties and provide the . . . tools necessary to allow the money markets to continue to function through the fourth quarter and early 2000."</br></br>Overnight rates often shoot up at the end of a year as many major banks, brokerages and investment-banking firms seek to improve the look of their balance sheets by shedding even modestly risky assets. This year, with all the concern about potential year-end computer problems, the pressures could be enormous, though no one is sure that will happen.
Investors aren't heartless, but they usually don't mind when workers' pay doesn't rise quickly.</br></br>That is because slow wage increases, while painful on an individual level, usually keep corporate profits high and inflation low, creating better opportunities for shareholders.</br></br>And yet, as if anyone needed further proof that we live in exceptional times, Wall Street is starting to complain that wages are too low.</br></br>"Without a real acceleration in wages it is hard to get a meaningful pickup in consumer spending," explained Michelle Meyer, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</br></br>Weak consumer spending holds back profits and economic growth, one reason stock gains this year have been soft. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 closed at records on Friday, but the Dow is up only 2.1% for 2014, and the S&P is up just 5.5%.
Given last week's grim jobs report, it's now clearer than ever that the November election will be a referendum on the economy. Has the president's program worked? Does Mitt Romney have a better program to promote job creation and prosperity? Fortunately, Americans have evidence that will allow them not only to judge President Obama's economic performance, but also to compare that performance with Mr. Romney's proposed alternative.</br></br>Twice in postwar America, deep recessions have driven the unemployment rate to 10%. In the 1981-82 recession, the unemployment rate soared to 10.8%. In the 2007-09 recession, it peaked at 10%.</br></br>Both downturns were rooted in financial convulsions. The 1981-82 recession was induced by restrictive monetary policy aimed at breaking the back of double-digit inflation and interest rates, which generated a housing and savings-and-loan crisis. The more recent recession resulted from excessive government intervention to increase homeownership by expanding subprime housing loans, on which substantial leverage was built. The resulting wave of defaults damaged the base of the banking system.</br></br>Fifty-three months after the start of the 1981-82 recession, total employment in the U.S. was up 7.5 million, or almost 7.5% higher than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate rose to 65% from 63.8%, as optimism about the future pulled potential workers into the job market. Real per capita gross domestic product increased by $2,870 and was 11% higher than when the recession started.</br></br>Fifty-three months after the start of the 2007-09 recession, however, total employment in the U.S. is still down four million jobs, or 2.7% lower than when the recession began. The labor-force participation rate has dropped to 63.8% from 66%, as discouraged workers have exited the labor market. Real per capita GDP has declined by $964 and is 2.2% lower today than when the recession began.
NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley & Co. thinks the stock market needs more program trading again.</br></br>In a decision that some traders fear could bring a return to wild price swings in stocks, Morgan Stanley said yesterday it is resuming "stock-index arbitrage" program trading for its own account. Nine months ago, Morgan and other major securities firms made a splashy pullback from such trading -- which is a common and controversial form of computer-aided program trading.</br></br>Rampant program trading by brokerage firms was blamed by many traders for contributing to the October 1987 stock market crash. No other trading technique so closely links the stock-index futures market in Chicago and the trading of stocks themselves in New York.</br></br>"I think we might go back to the Wild West days. I don't think anyone likes it," money manager James J. Cramer of Cramer & Co. said of the Morgan Stanley decision.</br></br>Before Morgan and the other firms backed away from doing index arbitrage for their own accounts in May 1988, index arbitrage was blamed on many days for wide swings in stock prices.
NEW YORK -- What goes on here?</br></br>Talk persists that a recession is brewing, very possibly arriving within the year. Yet, at the same time, signs mount that the economy is reasonably robust, with brisk gains in employment, capital spending and exports leading the way to new highs in overall business activity.</br></br>The juxtaposition may seem peculiar, to say the least, but there's really nothing very odd about it. Recessions normally do arrive on the heels of relatively robust economic activity, not when business is stagnating. This is because, in a sustained upswing, a burgeoning economy eventually comes up against barriers -- financial as well as physical -- to further growth. A recession perforce ensues.</br></br>How close to such a barrier point is the economy now?</br></br>Closer, perhaps, than is widely recognized.
For years, economists, labor leaders and businessmen told us that a little bit of inflation is good for us.</br></br>They said our inflation rate of 4 to 7 percent was being ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½balanced outï¿½Û by productivity increases of 3 to 4 percent, a year. Nobody worried about it.</br></br>We didnï¿½Ûªt become concerned until the rate of inflation began to escalate even as productivity declined.</br></br>Only then was inflation regarded as the countryï¿½Ûªs biggest problem ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ even more urgent than unemployment. Nothing is as quick to revive interest In that old-time economic religion as double-digit inflation.</br></br>Politicians who wanted to project an image of statesmanship and responsibility told us it was belt-tightening time. We would have to drive up interest rates, impose stricter credit terms, cut government spending at all levels, buy less from abroad and keep taxes high to cool off the pace of business activity.
Is it Morning in America, Again? President Bush seems to think so. But the type of morning he has in mind is, well, not exactly bright and cheery. We've been on a "binge," the president declared last week in Birmingham, and we've got a "hangover."</br></br>What a difference two years make. As late as mid-2000, no less an authority than Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had a very different view. We were, he wrote, living through a technological transformation that could permit full employment, balanced growth and low inflation to continue for a long time.</br></br>Bush has rejected Greenspan's view. For this, given the news, he can't be blamed. But what about the image of binge and hangover? Does it succeed as diagnosis -- and as a guide to what we should now do? Were the '90s lived in a stupor, and is recovery merely a matter of sleeping it off? Is a drinking problem, in short, a good metaphor for our economic problem?</br></br>We do know that the tech boom was mainly bubble. Its scientific component was vastly oversold. Huge capital sums were raised, and wasted. Meanwhile, throughout corporate America, profits were overstated under the relentless pressure of the markets. And billions were diverted to the pockets of corrupt directors, officers and CEOs.</br></br>But the fact that profits were lower than we thought is not all bad news. Living standards were actually higher than many realized at the time. The '90s were a good time for American workers, who enjoyed full employment, rising wages and unprecedented access to credit. Poverty fell during these years, health improved, crime declined and inequalities in pay (though not wealth) diminished. Home ownership reached record levels. These things, unlike profits, cannot be faked.
BONN, March 3ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In a gloomy report that could influence the outcome in West Germanyï¿½Ûªs elections Sunday, the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl announced today that the countryï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate rose in February to a record postwar level of 2.54 millionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½10.4 percent of the work force.</br></br>While the prospects of deploying modern nuclear missiles have aroused heated debate during the campaign, the pocketbook issues of how to revive a weak economy and curtail joblessnessï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which has grown faster here in the past two years than in any other Western European countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½have	generated public</br></br>Although stressing that the February report did not produce the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½horror figuresï¿½Û some people had expected, Josef Stingl, president of the Federal Labor Office, admitted that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we will look worse at the end of this year than we did at the end of 1982.ï¿½Û</br></br>Until now, generous welfare benefits have eased the burden of the unemployed.

Jonathan Yardleyï¿½Ûªs column, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Brigitte Bardot and the Baccalaureateï¿½Û [Style, Jan. 28] was disturbing. While he or I might not be particularly interested in studying popular culture issues raised in the films of Bardot, that doesnï¿½Ûªt mean that college study of popular culture as seen through those films is inherently bad. As a matter of fact, it might help students to think more critically and to better understand the world around us.</br></br>It is possible that this may be a good and valid class.

McCall was guilty of the venial sin of saying ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½theï¿½Û definition of average instead of "oneï¿½Û definition. An average is any measure of central tendency of a distribution; it is a generic term and includes both a median (the middle value) and the arithmetic mean (what you and lots of others call the average). These two averages give the same value when the distribution is symmetricalï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which is the case of studentsï¿½Ûª academic performance. These distinctions are not trivial: commercials and sales pitches of all kinds use the specific definition of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½averageï¿½Û that gives strength to their claim.</br></br>Incidentally, yet a third average (there are many more, depending on the analytical purpose) is the "modeï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that is, the specific value to which the largest single number of observations corresponds. I am afraid it is this kind of average that describes those who issue stern public corrections without really knowing what they are correcting.
A WHOLE generation of Americans, never having known any other trend, has grown up with the impression that creeping inflation is normal.</br></br>With but minor interruptions, prices have been inchingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sometimes gallopingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½upward ever since the late 30s.

The publication of Josef Joffe's "The Myth of America's Decline" marks the latest skirmish in the war of words over declinism that has raged off and on since the early 1970s. Unlike Great Britain at the end of the 19th century, Mr. Joffe argues, the United States is still leagues ahead of its major competitors. Besides, generations of skeptics have gone broke betting against us.</br></br>But anti-declinism easily shades over into complacency, a sentiment we cannot afford. Especially now, as the basis of our society, and of stable and decent political communities generally--a thriving and self-confident middle class--is eroding. Worse, either we don't know what to do about it, or we don't care enough to try.</br></br>Getty Images Robert Reich</br></br>In 1971, according to the Pew Research Center, 61% of all adults lived in middle-income households. By 2011, the middle-income share had fallen to 51%, while the lower- and upper-income sectors grew. Median household income in 2011 was not significantly higher than it had been in 1989. Because upper-income households fared much better during those four decades, their share of total household income increased by 17 percentage points--to 46% from 29%--while the middle-income share fell by 17 points, to 45% from 62%. No wonder Neiman-Marcus and Wal-Mart are doing well while J.C. Penney and Sears are nearing collapse.</br></br>These economic trends have social consequences. A recent study by Cornell University researcher Kendra Bischoff and Stanford's Sean Reardon finds that the share of families living in middle-income neighborhoods declined to 42% from 65% between 1970 and 2009. At the same time, the shares of families living in affluent neighborhoods and in poor neighborhoods more than doubled. Segregation along lines of income grew in each of the past decades, with the fastest growth coming between 2000 and 2009. This trend is not restricted to white Americans. In fact, segregation by income among black families grew four times as much as for whites, and Latino income segregation also increased more sharply.
Treasury prices fell heavily for much of the post-Christmas session, dragged by the dead weight of $22 billion in new two-year notes that drew only tepid demand at auction.</br></br>The only short-lived boost for Treasurys yesterday came from the early release of weak figures on house prices, and evidence of declining regional business activity.</br></br>The 10-city composite reading of Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller indexes declined 6.7% in October -- the biggest monthly decline in existing single-family homes on record. Weakness in housing is hardly a new story, but the market reaction was exaggerated by meager trading volumes, and the compounded impact of a weak Richmond Federal Reserve survey of regional business activity.</br></br>December's release showed the bank's manufacturing index falling to -4 from zero in November. The services sector reading reflected a slight improvement in this dominant area of the economy, rising to zero from -2 in November. But even holiday shopping did little to improve matters in the region's retail sector, which continued to contract in December.</br></br>The impact had worn off by late morning, however, and prices were heading back down in the lead up to the 1 p.m. EST auction of two-year notes. It's hardly a good time of year for aggressive bidding, but the recent liquidity concerns were expected to ensure reasonable demand for the sale.
Forty years ago this week, leaders from the United States and China broke decades of estrangement and ushered in a new era of relations between the two countries. That act of enormous courage and wisdom changed the world forever.</br></br>Now, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of Nixon's historic visit to China, and as Vice President Xi Jinping embarks on an important visit to the U.S., never before has there been such urgency to move the relationship forward to solve the many common challenges we face.</br></br>Today, whether the subject is nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, energy security, climate change, global economic recovery or financial stability, China and the U.S. have a common interest in working together on these and other transnational challenges.</br></br>Yet barriers on both sides prevent the relationship from fully developing. In China, many citizens and leaders question America's commitment to China. In America, nearly 60% of its people say they feel threatened by China's economic progress, according to a recent CBS News/New York Times poll.</br></br>In reality, these concerns overlook the substantial benefits both countries have received as a result of increased economic and trade cooperation.
The U.S. economy appears to be headed for a "soft landing" in which growth slows but does not pitch downward into a recession, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said yesterday.</br></br>"I think that the statistics that we've seen come out in the last month, in recent weeks, indicate that . . . we are headed toward a soft landing, if that," Brady told reporters at the White House. "Some statistics indicate that things are slowing down some. Others don't indicate that."</br></br>Meanwhile, there were indications that Federal Reserve policy-makers may have decided at a two-day meeting that ended yesterday to seek lower short-term interest rates to keep growth from becoming too slow.</br></br>The central bank chose not to intervene yesterday in the government securities market, a move that left more cash in the nation's banking system than had been expected.</br></br>The Fed's decision not to "drain" the money away caused a key short-term rate, the federal funds rate, to drop by about one-eighth of a percentage point, to 9.375 percent. The federal funds rate is the interest rate charged by banks with excess reserves to banks needing overnight loans to meet reserve requirements.
The nation's Rust Belt is rebounding economically but losing its political clout as it falls behind the South and West in population and jobs, according to a new analysis by the Northeast-Midwest Institute.</br></br>The report finds that after enduring high unemployment-10.3 percent-in the 1982 recession, the region's economy has improved and its unemployment was 6.5 percent in 1986, lower than in the South or West. Many of the manufacturing jobs lost during the recession are being replaced by high-tech service jobs, with New England performing especially well, the report says.</br></br>But the giant arc of 18 states stretching from Maryland through the Middle Atlantic and New England states and across the Midwest is steadily falling behind in population, according to the report by the institute, which represents public officials from the Northeast and Midwest.</br></br>Moreover, the region is lagging the South and West for the first time in manufacturing jobs and stands to lose 14 House seats in reapportionment after the 1990 census, pushing its share down to two-fifths.</br></br>The Northeast-Midwest sector has lost nearly 2 million manufacturing jobs since 1979, falling to 9.4 million in 1986, about 150,000 below the manufacturing total in the South and West.
Payroll Number</br></br>Is Going to End</br></br>Guessing Game</br></br>Investors have taken a glum view of the nation's labor markets this week. Now they'll find out if it's justified.</br></br>Economists surveyed by on Tuesday estimated the Labor Department will report today that the economy added 115,000 jobs in December, about in line with job growth in the past few months. Then economists spent the rest of the week ratcheting down their expectations.
WASHINGTON -- Large gains in personal income and consumer spending in September indicate that the economy probably will continue to grow at a moderate rate in coming months.</br></br>Personal income rose by a sturdy 0.9% during the month and consumer spending increased an even more robust 1.4%, the Commerce Department reported.That compares with income growth of 0.6% and flat consumption in August.</br></br>"These numbers should lay to rest for the time being any fears of recession," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Shearson Lehman/American Express Inc.</br></br>The report, which follows two months of largely sluggish economic statistics, was good news for President Reagan, who has just 2 1/2 weeks left in his reelection campaign.</br></br>But the department's report wasn't all roses. A consumption-based inflation measure, which is reported with a one-month lag, showed that prices paid by consumers were rising at a 0.6% rate in both July and August. That suggests an annual inflation rate exceeding 7%.
The Nationï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate dipped to 3.8 per cent, seasonally adjusted, in Septemberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the lowest level since April.</br></br>Arthur M. Ross, Commissioner of Labor Statistics, said the apparent improvement was due largely to the withdrawal of 3 million teenagers from the labor force as they left summer jobs to return to school.</br></br>Government economists generally regard a shift of only a tenth of 1 per cent in the over-all jobless rate as statistically insignificant because of sampling errors and random fluctuations. So far this year, unemployment has remained within a> narrow range of 3.7 to 4.C per cent.</br></br>programs must have caught on very well.ï¿½Û (Their withdrawal tends to push the jobless rate down because, although they constitute only one tenth of the labor force, the teenagersï¿½Ûª unemployment rate is triple t he national rating.).</br></br>ï¿½Û¢	A sharp increase in women jobholders (nearly a half million more than seasonal expectations) reflects a shortage of available men. The unemployment rate for males 20 and over is down to 2.4 per cent and loss than 100,000 have been added to the labor force in the past 12 months.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>Dollar Tree Inc. met its earnings targets for its fiscal first quarter. A Marketplace article on Monday incorrectly said that Dollar Tree was among the deep-discount retailers that had missed their earnings projections.</br></br>(WSJ July 13, 2011)</br></br>Sales and profit growth have started to slump at the deep-discount retailers called dollar stores, after a robust performance during the recession, a sign that even fairly cheap toys and other small indulgences now are a stretch for some consumers.</br></br>In the past several weeks, Dollar General Corp., Family Dollar Stores Inc. and Dollar Tree Inc., the country's three largest chains that sell sharply discounted food, household staples and other items in modest-size stores, all have missed their quarterly earnings targets.
How many more dashed hopes and false recoveries must we experience before politicians and monetary authorities accept the fact that our inability to manage fiat currencies is causing the global economic slowdown? They keep waiting for interest-rate reductions to kick in, yet more than six months after the Fed began lowering rates the economy continues to weaken. Waiting for the recently enacted tax cuts to provide "stimulus" will prove futile as well. The economy does not suffer a lack of consumer demand, and more money in people's pockets will not revive the supply side of the economy.</br></br>Ronald Reagan once said he knew of no great nation in history that went off the gold standard and remained great. Since Aug. 15, 1971, when the U.S. ceased to redeem dollars held by foreign governments for gold, we have put that thesis to the test. For the first time in human history, not a single major currency in the world was linked to a commodity. Economist Milton Friedman called the situation "unprecedented" and said it is "not a long-term viable alternative." "The world," he said, "needs a long-term anchor of some kind."</br></br>In the short term, at least, he was vindicated. In creating a world monetary system of floating fiat currencies with the stroke of a pen, President Nixon touched off world-wide inflation that lasted through the '70s and early '80s.</br></br>Yet America recovered to preside over the demise of world communism, and overcame the rising inflation and unemployment of "stagflation" to enjoy an unparalleled 18-year economic expansion. Today, the U.S. is at the pinnacle of its power and enjoying its greatest prosperity ever.</br></br>Were Messrs. Reagan and Friedman wrong? I don't think so. If the U.S. has so far come out on top in this experiment, it is only because other countries' economies have suffered even more from floating currencies.
The survival of a great American business may now depend on whether private investors will be allowed to succeed where government seems to be failing. We're referring to insurance giant AIG, which under the terms of a federal bailout is threatening to become a loser for taxpayers. Maybe it's time for the feds to consider Plan B.</br></br>With its September 16 rescue of the world's largest insurer, the New York Federal Reserve has managed to put taxpayers on the hook for more than $120 billion, but on terms so onerous that AIG may have to be sold in pieces at firesale prices. Most of the taxpayer exposure comes from an $85 billion revolving credit facility, in return for the government taking almost 80% of AIG's equity.</br></br>The Feds are charging AIG more than 10% interest on the entire $85 billion, even if the company doesn't borrow that much. The interest rate on money actually borrowed is more than 14%. One AIG shareholder likens it to a financial counselor advising someone struggling to pay the 6% interest on his mortgage to solve the problem by running up debt on his credit card. That's why the New York Federal Reserve recently had to bail out the bailout, lending another $37.8 billion at more attractive terms.</br></br>But the first transaction is still crushing the company, forcing a virtual liquidation. According to a source familiar with the company, AIG is suffering declines in renewals among corporate customers as it loses business to competitors. An AIG spokesman says, "Renewals worldwide are strong, but there are variations depending on the region and line of business." No one disputes, however, that interim CEO Ed Liddy's job is not so much to run the business as to prepare various AIG subsidiaries for quick and dirty sale, though there's no guarantee that the prices he gets will protect taxpayers from losses.</br></br>We have little sympathy for a company that sought government assistance, except that in this case shareholders were never permitted to vote on the deal. The shareholder with the largest stake, former CEO Hank Greenberg, says the firm would have been better off in Chapter 11. AIG directors instead had every incentive to choose a transaction with the government -- even on horrible terms -- over bankruptcy. That's because a bankruptcy filing would have stripped directors of legal protection.
(The (nlloicinci is enrolled from 'I'\ dcral Reset no Governor Brimmer's speech Pec. 27 to the American Economic Association at New Orleans)</br></br>I conclude that, the years of debate over the best way to conduct monetary policy in the United States have been productive. The Federal Reserve has learned a great deal about monetary management, and it is in a much better position to perform its duties.</br></br>There remains the question of my own attitude to the issues in the controversy. Of course, let me say immediately that 1 recognize that an excessive growth of bank credit .and the money supply does facilitate the propagation of inflation.</br></br>Rut 1 am convinced that it would bo a disastrous error for the Fcdcrnl Reserve to try to conduct monetary pol- icy on the basis of a fow simple rules governing the rate of expansion of the money supply. In the first place, 1 find serious deficiencies in the theoretical and empirical analysis on the basis of which the monetarists reach their conclusions and policy recommendations.</br></br>Put quite simply, they have not demonstrated convincingly that the relationship between the money supply and economic activity is especially close. Or, more importantly, they have not convincingly shown that money is more a cause than it is an effect of economic activity. While fluctuations in monetary conditions have undoubtedly contributed to economic instability on some occasions in the past, non-financial factors (such as wars, variations in the rate of business investment, and changes in consumer spend-ing/savings behnvior) have also been a principal source of fluctuations in output and employment.
Tom Brown, chairman of the Ward 8 Workforce Development Council, has perfected an approach to attacking urban poverty: He takes employers on a job tour in Southeast Washington neighborhoods to personally meet with unemployed residents.</br></br>Since October, more than 100 residents have found jobs in the twice-monthly sessions at churches and community centers in the heart of the neighborhood. The goal is to employ 300 residents a year.</br></br>"The success of it is because of the intimacy of the setup," Brown said. "It's straight talk between unemployed residents and employers."</br></br>If the city is going to reduce the number of families living in poverty, then innovative methods, such as Brown's, must be used to address unemployment, substance abuse, affordable housing, health care and education, he and others gathered at the Matthews Memorial Baptist Church in Southeast said yesterday.</br></br>Brown was one of 200 business and religious leaders, housing advocates and social services providers who participated in the Poverty Reduction Coalition hosted by D.C. Council member Marion Barry (D-Ward 8).
WASHINGTON -- The economy keeps percolating along at a steady clip, a series of new statistics released yesterday suggest.</br></br>New-home sales in August jumped 4.7% from July's strong level and hit the highest annual rate in more than a decade, the Commerce Department said. Separately, the agency reported that personal spending and personal income each rose a healthy 0.6% in August, following minuscule increases in July.</br></br>Most economists still expect the economy's growth rate for the third quarter, which will be announced later this month, was slower than the torrid 4.7% pace in the second quarter. But a raft of buoyant economic reports, including yesterday's figures, is encouraging some analysts to temper their predictions of a downturn.</br></br>"The momentum is quite healthy," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. "People were probably underestimating the strength of the third quarter."</br></br>A clearer picture of the economy's vitality will emerge today, with the announcement of two closely watched monthly indexes. The National Association of Purchasing Management will release its survey of the manufacturing sector, and the Conference Board will publish its index of leading economic indicators.
A coalition of labor and civil rights leaders gathered at Freedom Plaza yesterday to denounce the Bush administration's efforts to turn more federal work over to the private sector.</br></br>Between chants of "No privatization!" by members of federal unions, speakers contended that the administration's competitive sourcing initiative would take federal jobs away from minorities, women and veterans and weaken a civil service that protects the integrity of federal programs for all Americans.</br></br>"We perform our jobs in the public interest, not in the interest of profits or to promote any political agenda," Leora Rosen, a social science analyst at the Justice Department, told the crowd.</br></br>President Bush has said agencies should compete with companies for as many as 850,000 government jobs that are considered commercial in nature. The administration says it does not care who wins the right to perform the jobs because the competition will drive agencies to become more efficient and lower costs.</br></br>Directives from the Office of Management and Budget for agencies to put up half of their commercial jobs for bid over the next few years have roiled the federal workforce and created morale problems in some agencies. OMB hopes to issue streamlined rules for job competitions in the next few weeks, but the new procedures seem unlikely to ease employee concerns.
[Today's Market Forecast]</br></br>Data Deluge</br></br>If it is possible for one to curse under his breath and hold it at the same time, that is what investors are doing today.</br></br>They are cursing because a slew of big economic reports will keep them chained to their desks on the Friday before the Labor Day holiday. They are anxious because today's news will likely set the tone for trading for at least the next month.</br></br>On the docket: The Labor Department's August employment report, the University of Michigan's final read on consumer sentiment in August, the Institute for Supply Management's report on August manufacturing activity, the Commerce Department's July construction-spending report and August sales reports from auto companies.
DEARBORN, Mich., July 28ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Ford Motor Co. and the United Auto Workers opened contract talks here today amid union charges that the company is shifting too much work to outside suppliers, both foreign and domestic.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Ford is becoming more and more a hollow corporation, selling products it does not make,ï¿½Û said UAW President Owen Bieber.</br></br>to industry, is like ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½building a fine house on sinking sandfï¿½Û said Bieber said. Left unchecked, it could eliminate tens of thousands of jobs in the U.S. auto industry and undermine the American economy, Bieber said.</br></br>The union made similar charges yesterday at the beginning of negotiations in nearby Detroit with General Motors Corp., the nationï¿½Ûªs largest auto maker. Talks at both companies are aimed at replacing labor agreements that expire Sept. 14.</br></br>The negotiations will be difficult, union and company officials say. The industry is under siege by foreign manufacturers whoï¿½ï¿½ï¿½through im- and government spending on unemployment and welfare benefits rose. The Third World debt crisis would probably worsen as a major export market for developing countries shrank. And failures of banks and savings and loan associations might increase as bad loans multiplied.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>WASHINGTON -- U.S. house prices are likely to grow at the slowest pace in more than three decades as interest rates climb and land prices take a tumble over the next three years, researchers at the Federal Reserve have estimated in a new study.</br></br>The study, published on the bank's Web site recently, asserts that if U.S. disposable income and short-term interest rates climb as much as Wall Street expects them to, nominal existing-house prices would increase a cumulative 2.6% over the next three years. That would mark the lowest rate since the government began keeping records in 1970. The number implies high odds that house prices will decline in inflation-adjusted terms.</br></br>The conclusions validate the unease of many private economists who fear the U.S. housing market, having benefited recently from rapid price gains that helped maintain strong consumer spending through a recession, may become a source of economic instability as interest rates climb. Prices of existing homes rose by more than 20% cumulatively over the last three years, according to the National Association of Realtors. The association has been predicting only a modest slowdown for the next few years.</br></br>"Of primary concern to some analysts is whether the recent run-up in aggregate home prices will be somewhat reversed, much like the 1985-90 and 1990-1995 experience," when inflation-adjusted house prices declined in several major metropolitan areas, write the authors of the Fed study, Morris Davis and Jonathan Heathcote. Mr. Davis is a Fed economist, and Mr. Heathcote is an assistant professor of economics at Georgetown University.
NEW YORK, Oct. 5 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The stock market, riding rumors of a new dollar-rescue plan, racked up a broad gain in heavy trading today and reached its highest level of the year.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials flirted briefly -with the 900 level at mid-afternoon before closing at 897.61, up 7.51 for the day and 19.03 for the week.</br></br>New York Stock Exchange volume reached 48.25 million shares, the second highest total of 1979, surpassed only by a 52.38 million-share day two weeks before.</br></br>Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, came to 54.31 million shares Friday.</br></br>The price of gold fell sharply in early trading Friday, continuing the slide of the past two days, but then rebounded to recover its early losses.
AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>"This is already indicated by the fact that [U.S. trade officials] have suggested if they apply retaliatory measures, it'll only [affect] about $1 billion," said William Cline, an economist with the Institute for International Economics. "The direct effect would be small," he said.</br></br>Though European Union and Canadian trade ministers also will be represented at the talks, the auto dispute between the U.S. and Japan is by far the marquee event of this week's "quadrilateral" negotiations. The huge auto-trade imbalance is called the biggest glitch in their economic relationship and so, with the dollar at historic lows against the yen and the U.S. trade deficit at record highs, the talks have gained increased relevance.</br></br>U.S. officials say they will make a strong bid for settlement this week. But they insist there can't be one unless Japan agrees to a so-called "voluntary plan" for its auto makers to purchase more U.S. car parts. Last week, a Tokyo trade official insisted Japan won't do it.</br></br>"We have lots of room for negotiation and compromise in some areas, but there's no room for compromise on the voluntary plan," he said.
NEW YORK -- Short interest rose at the New York Stock Exchange in late October in the wake of the market's fresh records earlier in the month.</br></br>For the period ending Oct. 31, the number of short-selling positions not yet closed out at NYSE -- so-called short interest -- rose 2.4% to 11,932,729,768 shares from 11,654,666,528 shares in mid-month.</br></br>The short ratio, or number of days' average volume represented by the outstanding short positions at the exchange, fell to 8.4 from 9.6 in mid-October.</br></br>Investors who "short" shares borrow them and sell them, betting the price will fall and they will be able to buy the shares later at a lower price for return to the lender.</br></br>In general, the higher the short interest, the more investors expect a downturn.
For some money managers, the recent turbulence in the stock market isn't a reason to worry. It is a healthy sign.</br></br>Markets were rattled last week as the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.4%. The Dow, Nasdaq and S&P 500 are all down for the year after advancing earlier in 2014, following a sharp reversal in once-hot corners of the market such as initial public offerings and the shares of young biotechnology and Internet companies.</br></br>The pullback underscores concern over the broader outlook for share prices following a 30% rise in the S&P 500 last year. Valuations remain above long-term averages, while U.S. growth and corporate earnings have hit a soft patch. That is exactly kind of environment that calls for a bumpier stock market, investors say.</br></br>"You don't want a market to go just straight up to the sky," says Lew Piantedosi, manager of the $142 million Eaton Vance Large-Cap Growth Fund, which has lost 5.5% over the past month but is up 19% over the past year. "When you go straight up, there's not a lot of support on the way down."</br></br>After a run such as the nearly 30% gain in the S&P 500 in 2013, it is better for stocks to level off for a bit, he said. "We're seeing that now," he said. He expects that as investors get more comfortable with the global economic outlook, stocks will resume their rally.
Author: Al Lewis</br></br>As the portfolios of ordinary shareholders imploded in the second stock-market crash of the 21st century, CEOs looked up from the smoke and ashes and breathed a collective sigh of, "Hey, you know what? It's a buying opportunity."</br></br>Only CEOs don't have to buy. They get their crony boards to award them stock options.</br></br>More than 90% of the CEOs of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index loaded up with stocks or options in the grim, uncertain months between October 2008 and September 2009. And the value of this largely free equity has since grown by more than $3 billion, according to an analysis of S&P data published by The Wall Street Journal last week.</br></br>The crash allowed our fearless corporate leaders to bet on a scary market at an extremely low price with no risk to themselves. And since the market had crashed so hard, and stock was so cheap, they were able to bag larger numbers of options and shares as well.
To Pope Benedict, experts say, the U.S. Catholic Church is a bit like an adolescent: young and unpredictable.</br></br>There are bankrupt dioceses and empty seminaries -- yet tens of thousands of laypeople are stepping into the chasm to lead their churches.</br></br>One of every 10 American Catholics has left the faith -- yet close to half of U.S. Catholics attend Mass at least monthly.</br></br>Tens of thousands of traditional Catholics have clamored for tickets to the pope's Thursday Mass at Nationals Park, yet many more think he's too rigid -- or irrelevant.</br></br>"At the Vatican, there is an admiration for American religiosity," said Monsignor Lorenzo Albacete, a theologian. "But there is a question whether American religiosity is strong enough. It appears to be, from the Vatican point of view, content-free, more spiritual high and emotion than a serious question as to what is true and what is not."
The dollar is expected to advance against the yen but struggle against the euro this week after encouraging U.S. jobs data renewed investors' confidence in the global economic recovery.</br></br>The main beneficiaries of that more-positive growth outlook are likely to be higher-yielding currencies such as the Australian and New Zealand dollar, which advanced Friday as investors, emboldened by the better-than-expected reading on the U.S. labor market, returned in strength to growth-sensitive assets.</br></br>The euro could also benefitat least against the dollar and the yenthough much will depend on further developments in Greece, with investors still concerned over the debt-laden nation's ability to significantly shrink its budget deficit as demanded by the European Union. The yen, the classic refuge in times of trouble, is set to decline further against the dollar.</br></br>"I think the [U.S.] dollar is going to stay pretty heavy against the euro," said Daniel Katzive, foreign-exchange strategist at Credit Suisse in New York. But against the yen, after the jobs report, "it's going to be pretty well supported," he said.</br></br>With the U.S. data calendar rather light this week, attention will continue to focus on the resolution of Greece's fiscal woes. Analysts see the euro ranging from $1.35 to $1.37, and the dollar from 89 yen to 92 yen.
WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service picked a team of companies led by Computer Sciences Corp. to take over the agency's bungled computer-modernization program.</br></br>The multibillion-dollar project, expected to stretch over more than a decade, could become the biggest nondefense contract ever awarded by the federal government and is one of the most prestigious.</br></br>For the troubled tax collector, the award marks a sharp about-face. The IRS will rely for the first time on the private sector to update its aged computer system, abandoning numerous efforts to do so internally, even when it clearly lacked the expertise. For taxpayers, the IRS insists, the system designed by CSC of El Segundo, Calif., will finally make gaining access to personal records and reaching agency officials by phone as easy as dealing with a bank or credit-card company -- though they caution that goal will still take years to reach.</br></br>"The IRS needs to break out of its technological time warp from the 1950s and 1960s," Commissioner Charles Rossotti said in a statement. "This new partnership will help us replace archaic technology with the modern tools we need. . . . This marriage of the private and public sectors offers the best approach," he added.</br></br>Yesterday's announcement was also a huge victory for CSC -- an information-technology, consulting, and outsourcing giant -- which bested a rival group headed by Lockheed Martin Corp. of Bethesda, Md., in the yearlong competition for the project. With revenue last fiscal year of $6.6 billion, CSC is less than one-third the size of Lockheed Martin. CSC officials said the IRS award could end up as the largest contract the firm has ever won.
BAL HARBOUR, Fla., Dec. 5ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Charles 0. Finley, owner of the Oakland Athletics, has done more for employment</br></br>New York Yankees, whence came. But the latest word on thl ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Yankee Clipper,ï¿½Û voted baseball] greatest living player, is that will join the office of commissiorj er Bowie Kuhn.</br></br>of the St. Louis Cardinals and Ted Williams is here as the manager of the Washington Senators. Musial, Williams and DiMaggio are the greatest retired names in baseball.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ITï¿½ÛªS GOOD TO have all these people still associated with baseball.ï¿½Û said Finley, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and Iï¿½Ûªm glad I did my part in bringing DiMaggio back. Do you know, I never even met the man before I hired him.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He was worth every penny I paid for him,ï¿½Û said Finley. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He exerted an enormous influence on my players. Iï¿½Ûªve never met a finer man. Joe was supposed to be an introvert and withdrawn, according to what I had been told about him. But lie's poised and meets people well. We got to be very good friends and I donï¿½Ûªt know where all those stories popped up that we weren't getting along.ï¿½Û Commissioner Kuhn probably wants DiMaggio as a goodwill ambassador for baseball. Kuhn accompanied DiMaggio to Vietnam after the World Series and was impressed by the eagerness of the troops to meet the legendary baseball figure. Nobody had the impact of DiMaggio on the troops and Kuhn took careful note that this would be a good man to represent the game.</br></br>IF DiMAGGIO was an influence for good on the Oakland players, a stronger influence for bad must have been exerted on the Athletics, who were supposed to run away and hide in the American Leagueï¿½Ûªs West Division. Finley was so upset that his team didnï¿½Ûªt gain the championship playoff that he fired manager Hank Bauer, who still has another year on his contract. Bauer was fired once before and then rehired. Why?
Limited international exposure and continued strong end markets helped U.S. building-products companies continue their streak of strong earnings in the third quarter.</br></br>Except for company-specific problems at paint and coatings provider Sherwin Williams Co. and tool maker Stanley Works, analysts say they see little bad news coming out of the sector. They said the moderate inventory correction in retail home-center distribution channels was a second-quarter phenomenon.</br></br>"Although there are some individual cases where they're not, most of these companies are hitting on all cylinders," said analyst Peter Dannenbaum of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.</br></br>While the Asian turmoil has hurt U.S. companies in other sectors, many building-products companies have little or no exposure to that region and so are immune from some global pressures. In addition, the companies don't have negative currency translations and few exports, said analyst Jonathan Goldfarb of Merrill Lynch & Co.</br></br>"All those global forces that are causing big earnings shortfalls don't affect them, so the earnings trends are especially strong," he said.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) will estimate this week that the federal budget deficit for fiscal 1991 will be $138 billion, congressional sources said.</br></br>The figure is substantially higher than the roughly $100 billion deficit projected by the Bush administration, the sources said. Both estimates are far higher than the $64 billion deficit target for fiscal 1991 set by the Grnnim-Rudtnan-Hollings budget law. That law requires that enough spending cuts and revenueraising measures be taken to achieve a $64 billion deficit in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1.</br></br>The CBO estimates provide fresh evidence that the nonpartisan congressional agency is far less optimistic about the budget outlook than is the presidentï¿½Ûªs Office of Management and Budget. The estimates are based on projections that assume current spending and tax policies do not change.</br></br>While the CBO figures are sure to be cited by administration critics who think that the OMB projections are too rosy, their practical impact on the budget process is limited.</br></br>The congressional agency plays only an advisory role in determining whether the deficit targets set by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings have been breached. By law, it is the OMB estimates that are used at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether spending must he cut across the board to meet the lawï¿½Ûªs requirements.
NEW YORK, April 8ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market roared ahead today, emerging from a steep slump, as interest rates and oil prices resumed their descent.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks surged 34.25 points to 1,769.76, the lOth-biggest daily increase ever and its best gain since March 14, when it jumped 39.03 points.</br></br>The strong showing allowed Wall Street's best-known indicator to recover about one-third of the loss suffered since the industrial average reached a record closing peak of 1,821.72 on March 27.</br></br>Stocks drew strength from a powerful bond market rally. When trading came to a close, the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond sported a gain of nearly $30 for each $1,000 in face amount. The bondï¿½Ûªs yield tumbled to 7.38 percent from 7.59 percent late Monday.</br></br>Interest-rate reductions announced today in Belgium and Britain stirred fresh optimism about the chances for further declines in U.S. interest rates, analysts said.
Federal Reserve officials are taking a steady-as-she-goes stance as they prepare for their policy meeting this month, even though market volatility and uncertainties about the global economic outlook have rattled investors in recent weeks and led to some mixed messages from central bank officials.</br></br>The Fed is highly likely to end its bond-buying program on schedule at the Oct. 28-29 meeting, according to recent interviews with officials and their public statements. Officials also are preparing to debate whether to fine-tune the Fed's formal assessment of the labor market and the guidance it provides about the likely path of interest rates.</br></br>"I haven't really changed my view on the economic outlook," San Francisco Fed President John Williams said in an interview Friday.</br></br>He sees the economy growing at a 3% annual rate in the second half of the year and into 2015, the jobless rate continuing to fall and inflation gradually rising to the Fed's 2% goal. "My baseline forecast implies ending the asset-purchase program on schedule."</br></br>The Fed has been buying mortgage and long-term Treasury bonds since 2012 in an effort to hold down long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy. The Fed said after its September meeting it intended to end the program this month. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said last week the Fed should consider extending the program because U.S. inflation expectations appear to be drifting down, a possible sign of continuing economic headwinds. But other officials haven't embraced the idea of continuing the bond purchases.
NEW YORK -- Shades of 1987?</br></br>The New York Stock Exchange offered up a cautionary indicator yesterday, when a membership seat sold for a record $1,250,000. That breaks the previous high of $1,150,000 set a month before the October 1987 stock market crash.</br></br>To some, record seat-sale prices indicate bubbling investor optimism, and a top for stock prices.</br></br>"History has shown that it's a contrary opinion, sentiment-type indicator," says Ralph Bloch, market strategist at Raymond James & Associates, St. Petersburg, Fla. But the timing "can be very elusive."</br></br>Yesterday's sale price is 19% more than the previous sale of $1,050,000 in December.
NEW YORK -- It is the world's largest software company and accounts for 10% of the Nasdaq 100 Index, but Microsoft has been overlooked by the recent rally.</br></br>The stock is basically flat for the year, compared with a 26% jump for the Nasdaq 100 and 15% rise for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. That lag has caught the attention of options traders and strategists, some of whom are seeking ways to position for a possible rebound of the software company relative to the broad market.</br></br>Neil Herman, Lehman Brothers' software analyst, said he believes the Redmond, Wash., company is well positioned for the coming quarter. Although summer can be a slow season for software revenue, Microsoft remains a good defensive play, he said in a research note; after all, it isn't clear if technology spending will pick up to the extent many investors had hoped as they loaded up on more volatile tech stocks.</br></br>Other strategists pointed out how Microsoft has underperformed compared with sectors such as biotechnology and semiconductors and could catch up if investors believed these other sectors were becoming overbought.</br></br>Meanwhile, implied volatility of three-month options on Microsoft is a bit below average levels during the past year, making its calls relatively inexpensive, Lehman options strategist James Hosker said.
Stock and bond markets rebounded sharply in what many analysts said were technical rallies following sustained declines.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 47.30 points to 2590.54 in active trading. And the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond climbed one point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount.</br></br>The dollar, meanwhile, slid back from levels reached in Tuesday's big rally. That rally was triggered by subsequently denied rumors that Mikhail Gorbachev was considering resigning as head of the Soviet Communist Party.</br></br>Analysts were skeptical about the nature of the stock and bond market rallies, noting that investors and traders in each market sought out reasons to be optimistic and ignored evidence to the contrary.</br></br>The stock market rally, for instance, began at the opening bell after an early-morning report that the index of leading economic indicators for December rose much more than expected. Investors concluded the economy isn't as weak -- and corporate earnings not as likely to decline -- as they had suspected. But investors chose to ignore a later report that showed new home sales at their lowest levels in five years, evidence that a large sector of the economy remains very weak.

Stock prices surged to new highs, powered by expectations of lower interest rates and investors' fears of being left behind by the bull market.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 23.05 points to 1462.27, surpassing the previous record, set Monday. Other widely watched market barometers established records, too.</br></br>Advancing stocks led declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange by more than three to one. Trading volume on the Big Board swelled to 150.3 million shares.</br></br>The advance surprised Wall Street analysts and traders. Many professionals had expected that a small decline -- which they call a "correction" -- or a period of lackluster trading would precede further major gains in the market.</br></br>"People got concerned that they would miss the market," said William LeFevre, market strategist at Purcell, Graham & Co. "Each day, the market went up without a correction. A lot of people couldn't wait any longer, and they jumped in."
SAN JOSE -- A voter initiative to raise this city's minimum wage, set for the November ballot, has spurred a fight with small-business owners who say it could drive up costs and force layoffs.</br></br>The proposition, created by a group of San Jose State University students, would raise the city's hourly minimum wage to $10 from the current $8 state requirement, and include yearly inflation adjustments. It is modeled on San Francisco's 2003 minimum-wage ordinance, which is tied to the Consumer Price Index that since 2003 has raised the minimum wage by $3.49 to $10.24 an hour.</br></br>San Jose business leaders say the increase would drive businesses from the city.</br></br>"I don't think the measure's proponents understand the economic impact this will have on small and medium-sized businesses," says Matt Mahood, president of the San Jose Chamber of Commerce. "Most of these guys are already struggling with the down economy and now this will compound their problems."</br></br>Mr. Mahood says business owners won't only have to pay more to their workers but also will see a 15% to 17% increase in their payroll taxes, since they are tied to the wage rate.
Don't get fooled by the coming Wall Street head fake.</br></br>Even as market conditions appear to be more favorable for the trading operations of big Wall Street banks, the weight of regulation will continue to be a drag on the business.</br></br>Daniel Tarullo, the Federal Reserve governor who serves as the central bank's point person on regulation, told the Senate Banking Committee Tuesday that regulators are crafting rules that would require banks to finance their short-term securities lending with a significant amount of stable funding. And customers such as hedge funds would be required to post collateral meeting regulatory minimums.</br></br>The combined effect would be akin to a tax on leveraged trading, making it more expensive for banks to provide short-term credit to the customers of their trading desks. The very likely result is a long-term reduction in trading activity and slimmer profits.</br></br>Mr. Tarullo also outlined Fed plans to impose a risk-based capital surcharge on the most systemically important banks. Importantly, that will penalize reliance on short-term funding that the Fed considers vulnerable to runs.
For the second time in a year, Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia shook up its executive suite, placing Martha Stewart herself squarely on the hot seat during the harshest ad recession in decades.</br></br>The company said Tuesday that Wenda Harris Millard, a fixture in advertising circles who was named co-chief executive in June, is leaving. She will join Media Link LLC, a Los Angeles consulting firm run by well-known ad executive Michael Kassan.</br></br>Ms. Millard's departure -- following clashes with Ms. Stewart, according to people familiar with the matter -- costs the company a key link to Madison Avenue at a time of weak marketing spending. Earlier this month, Jacki Kelley, an ad executive close to Ms. Millard, left Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia for a top job at Universal McCann, a media-buying firm owned by Interpublic Group.</br></br>The latest shake-up comes after ad pages plummeted 37% from a year earlier at Martha Stewart Living magazine in the first quarter and declined by half at Everyday Food. A contract with Sears Holdings' Kmart stores that has been a significant contributor to the company's profits is slated to expire in coming months. Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia has posted just one profitable year in the past five, and investors have long complained about its spending, including its executive-compensation packages.</br></br>Ms. Millard's departure comes a little less than a year after Susan Lyne stepped down as CEO. Ms. Lyne had helped stabilize the company during Ms. Stewart's legal troubles.
Employers might grumble about state unemployment insurance taxes whenever they do their books, but the fees make headlines only when there's a problem -- and there is a serious one in Maryland, business owners say.</br></br>Battle lines were drawn Thursday in what promises to be one of the first and most contentious battles when Maryland's General Assembly reconvenes in Annapolis next month.</br></br>Unemployment insurance costs for Maryland business owners are slated to jump 267 percent from $51 for each employee to $187 per employee annually under a law intended to keep the state's unemployment insurance fund from going bankrupt as early as March. The fund has a balance of about $200 million, but the state has been forced to pay as much as $24 million weekly, or twice as much as usual, to cover unemployment claims. The fund won't receive enough new money to keep it solvent until tax returns are filed in April.</br></br>Gov. Martin O'Malley on Thursday released a package of proposals his administration said would keep the fund in the black until then, and limit employers' new costs to $153 annually for one employee. He said his plan would reduce penalties for business owners to pay the tax over time through payment plans.</br></br>O'Malley would accomplish that largely by bowing to changes that Congress and President Obama want states to make in unemployment insurance systems. For Maryland, those changes would mean $127 million in federal stimulus funding.
Jobless Marylanders soon may be able to file their claims by telephone and collect unemployment benefits from bank cash machines under a plan that officials say could save the state about $100,000 a year.</br></br>Use of bank machines and "smart cards" could provide quicker, more secure payment to qualified applicants, said Thomas Wendell, director of the state Office of Unemployment Insurance.</br></br>"My job is trying to get people back to work, in suitable employment," Wendell said. "This system is something that could help to do that job better." The system, which is being tested in Washington state, also uses automatic teller machines to publicize job openings.</br></br>Maryland's Job Service helps place about 10 percent of the 80,000 people who find new jobs in the state each year, Wendell said. With electronic job-matching capability for unemployment claimants, that percentage should greatly increase, he said.</br></br>Wendell plans to talk next month with Washington state unemployment officials and representatives of TransFirst Corp., the Dallas firm that developed the system.
Carlos Pastor stepped from the E.F. Hutton Group Inc. headquarters building into today's bone-chilling rain with his hands jammed into his pockets and his shoulders hunched up. The wind gusted. It was a lousy day to lose a job.</br></br>Six months ago, Pastor graduated from college and came to work at Hutton as a support clerk in the investment firm's block trading department. He thought that he was about to begin a long and secure career. But by the end of today, he expected to be out of work-along with all but three of the approximately 60 stock traders in his department.</br></br>"I never expected this to happen. Right now, it's just confusing," Pastor said. "We're getting shafted. We're definitely getting shafted. ... They're all pretty ticked off up there."</br></br>Pastor is one of an estimated 5,000 Hutton employes expected to lose their jobs by early next year because of the firm's merger with Shearson Lehman Bros. Ending 83 years of independence, Hutton sought the Shearson merger because of problems stemming from its past legal difficulties and the October stock market collapse.</br></br>Hundreds of employes were notified of their fate today. Whole departments, such as the Hutton block trading department, were virtually wiped out by layoffs, employes said. The firings were heaviest in the investment banking area, including corporate finance, mergers and institutional sales and trading, the employes said.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices were little changed in mostly torpid trading as investors began their monthly ritual of waiting for the employment report.</br></br>For bond investors, the Department of Labor's monthly report has become the most anxiously awaited of all government economic indicators. It has the ability to sway sentiment and move the markets, which explains why some investors shy away from the market in the days before its release. The June employment report will be released on Friday.</br></br>The approaching July Fourth holiday, which falls in the middle of the week, also kept many investors away.</br></br>"We're really playing with a half-staff on Wall Street," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist and managing director at Midland Montagu Securities Inc. "The first half of the week will be treated as if it is an extended holiday." He said that traders, investors and investment advisers will likely return on Friday, in time for the release of the June employment report.</br></br>In the municipal market, traders kept close watch on bonds issued by the city of Philadelphia. On Friday, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded about $1.35 billion of the city's outstanding general obligation bonds to Ba from Baa, citing a burgeoning budget deficit and continued uncertainties surrounding the development of recurring funding sources.

NEW YORK, April 24 (APIï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wide gain* by electronics anti selected issues combined with solid gains by blue chips to give the stock market a snappy recovery today.</br></br>Gains by key stocks represented in the popular averages went from fractions to about 2 points. Among secondary issues the gains went to as much as 1414 by highflying Zenith.</br></br>The two makers of compact autos, Stude-baker-Packard and American Motors, continued as the top trading favorites. Today, however, American Motors dipped on profit taking.

The Dow-Jones industrial average rose 4.12 to 627.39.</br></br>It was the first time Ford had closed higher than the 64% original price when Ford stock was first sold publicly in January 1956.
NEW YORK -- New construction contracts climbed a seasonally adjusted 12% in January from the previous month, reflecting improved weather conditions, F.W. Dodge Co. said.</br></br>In its monthly survey of construction-contract activity, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. said new construction in January totaled $13.75 billion. The rebound "seemed to confirm that the unusually severe weather early in the winter upset the seasonal rhythm of the construction business," said George A. Christie, vice president and chief economist for F.W. Dodge.</br></br>Mr. Christie noted that when the January and December contract totals are averaged, the rate of activity has been nearly level since last summer, when interest rates stabilized. "Whether constuction activity advances or recedes from this plateau will depend mostly on the next development in the credit market," he said.</br></br>Residential building contracts were particularly strong in the January rebound, Dodge said. The value of contracts for one-family homes, apartments and condominiums, hotels and motels was $6.6 billion in January, up 16% on a seasonally adjusted basis.</br></br>Nonresidential building contracts, particularly for factories, warehouses and offices, also rebounded sharply in January, rising an adjusted 14% in January to $5.3 billion after an 8% decline in December.
WASHINGTON -- The federal budget deficit narrowed to $24.7 billion in August from $43.65 billion a year earlier because of a fluke of the calendar, the Treasury said.</br></br>Aug. 1 fell on a Saturday this year, so military pay, veterans benefits and supplemental Social Security benefits usually paid in August were made on July 31, shrinking the August deficit.</br></br>For the first 11 months of fiscal 1992, which began Oct. 1, government receipts totaled $972.86 billion, up 3% from $944.92 billion the year before. Outlays through August totaled $1.268 trillion, up 5% from $1.208 trillion a year earlier.</br></br>That produced a total deficit of $295.60 billion for the first 11 months of fiscal 1992, nearly 13% larger than $262.61 billion reported for those months in fiscal 1991. The deficit for all of fiscal 1991 was $269.49 billion.</br></br>The August deficit compared with a revised deficit of $43.15 billion in July.
Stock prices slid in active trading as many of the winners of the past 12 months continued to lead the market lower.</br></br>Drug, food and tobacco stocks were for sale yesterday by investors as they put more faith in an improving economy ahead and focused on more cyclical issues. Issues sensitive to interest rates lost ground as rates rose and oil stocks sustained heavy profit-taking.</br></br>Many technology stocks, however, including International Business Machines, moved higher despite the downbeat tone of the market.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 11.11 points at 1888.64. The industrial average began its slide at the opening bell and showed a loss of more than 16 points at 3 p.m. EDT. However, several broad buy programs helped erase some of the losses in the final hour of trading.</br></br>Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 2.33 to 248.14, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index declined 1.47 to 142.42.
Gov. Mark White, left, House Speaker Gib Lewis and Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby discuss legislative proposals earlier this week.</br></br>The White House announced yesterday in Santa Barbara that President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, will give a nationally televised speech on drugs Sept. 14, shortly after Congress returns from recess to consider sweeping antidrug legislation.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When the chapter on how America won the war on drugs is written,ï¿½Û a White House statement said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Reagansï¿½Ûª speech is sure to be viewed as a turning point.ï¿½Û</br></br>But in campaigns across the country and in political caucuses on Capitol Hill, lawmakers of both parties were already poised to run with the issue, and the Democratic-con-trolled House was preparing for action within days after its return from recess.</br></br>After a summer of intense publicity about drug abuse, Congress and the president are heading back to Washington next week primed to seize the drug issue and, if possible, gain credit in a midterm election year for doing something about it.
NEW YORK, Oct. 30ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Wall Street stocks rose today on growing speculation that interest rates will be cut soon, but investor nervousness about the weak state of the economy kept trading choppy.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 9.84 points to close at 3071.78. Advancing issues outpaced those declining by about 3 to 2 in brisk New York Stock Exchange trading of 195 million shares.</br></br>The Nasdaq over-the-counter index, which has leaped ahead of the Dow and other blue-chip indicators, scored a new closing high of 541.32, up 6.81 from Tuesday and up from the previous record of 540.94 set Oct. 16.</br></br>Despite the gains, traders remained wary about key reports on the economy, including jobless data, due Friday.</br></br>The Federal Reserve may have encouraged a move toward lower rates in the money markets today, when it allowed the benchmark federal funds lending rate to slip below its target of 5.25 percent. The Fed also made an unusual pre-announcement that it planned to make overnight system repurchases on Thursday, adding cash to the banking system. Both moves raised speculation of an easing of interest rates, although some economists maintained they were technical operations to add cash to the banking system and not a signal of policy changes.
WASHINGTON -- Surprising strength in the U.S. economy and a determination to respond quickly to hints of renewed inflation caused the Federal Reserve to tighten its grip on credit in late March, newly released minutes of Fed meetings show.</br></br>The decision to reverse course, which had been widely reported but not previously confirmed by the Fed, led to higher interest rates immediately after the March 29 meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee. The minutes of the meeting were released Friday after the customary seven-week delay.</br></br>The Fed tightened credit again in early May because of continued fears of inflation. That move wasn't covered in the minutes released Friday. The Open Market Committee held a regularly scheduled session last week at which it apparently didn't change its credit position.</br></br>The minutes of the Open Market Committee offer one of the few ways for outsiders to get a glimpse of the Fed's deliberations. Before the March 29 meeting, economists generally predicted that the Fed wouldn't tighten credit. But at the meeting, only one of the 11 committee members, Fed Governor Martha Seger, dissented from the tightening move.</br></br>Among the others, the only disagreement was a matter of degree. "Most indicated a preference for only a slight move toward restraint, at least at this time, but a few urged somewhat greater tightening," the minutes say.
The recent announcement by New York Life Insurance Co. that it is liquidating its entire $1 billion stock portfolio because of its dissatisfaction with the market's volatility furnishes dramatic evidence that the flight of the investor from the securities market continues unabated. Now, not only the small investor but also some larger institutions are exiting a stock market in which sharp fluctuations in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, often unaccompanied by any significant external news or event, recur with predictable frequency.</br></br>The pattern of these fluctuations is particularly revealing. Often, trading will remain flat throughout the day, only for prices to dive suddenly at the close in the face of heavy institutional trading. Admittedly, one cannot legislate a secure investment environment, but investors are unlikely to return to the market until they see it as a relatively stable repository for their funds. A market that can move 20-30 points in a few minutes, because of sudden selling pressure, will not be so perceived.</br></br>Yet, wasn't it exactly this problem that the proposals of the Brady Commission and other recent reports were supposed to address? The short answer is no. The recommendations advanced by both Brady and the SEC understandably focused on a worse-case scenario: how to avoid a financial meltdown. As a result, short of a catastrophic event, their proposed reforms will have little impact and could even be counterproductive.</br></br>Consider, for example, the two most discussed Brady proposals: (1) the circuit-breaker reforms, and (2) the recommendation that margin rules be effectively equalized between the securities and futures exchanges. Will it create confidence among small investors to know that in the future a brief inter-market trading halt will occur once the stock market declines 250 points or more? Such a proposal is as reassuring as a contingency plan for urban survival after a nuclear holocaust.</br></br>More important, circuit breakers create an incentive to sell as their triggering point is neared; thus, they can exacerbate matters by encouraging a "run on the bank" as investors sell because they suspect others will also do so as the trigger point is neared. If trading halts are to reduce volatility, they will have to be introduced at a much earlier point and seek to bridge temporary order imbalances. Although probably feasible, such a proposal risks the danger that any halt will be interpreted as an adverse signal that triggers still more selling.
"DISTANT," a moving character piece from Nuri Bilge Ceylan, clearly derives some of its sensibilities from the hallowed cinematic churches of Andrei Tarkovsky and Yasujiro Ozu (and there's a little Chekhov, too, in his approach). Following the protracted tension between two lonely Turkish men, it at first seems to be about nothing, a minute-to-minute observation of two uneventful, frustrating lives.</br></br>Ultimately, it becomes a movie about the feeling of being alive, the sensation of existence. It's a movie, in a way, about everything.</br></br>One of the men is Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir), a bearded, quiet photographer in Istanbul who has divorced his wife. He has a job, taking shots of objects for a commercial business. But he's essentially alone and lonely. There is a woman with whom he spends time on occasion; and he reaches for the odd porn video, too. Surrounded by books and photographs, he keeps a clean house. He's set in his ways and heading nowhere.</br></br>When his younger cousin Yusuf (Mehmet Emin Toprak) comes to visit, Mahmut's comfortably self-contained routine is broken. The visitor, who hails from the same village as Mahmut, has lost his factory job. He hangs around the port, looking for any kind of work. His hope is to find a job on a luxury cruiser that travels around the world. He has no luck. There's a nationwide recession.</br></br>Yusuf, not a particularly attractive man with an ungainly bump on the side of his face, is a slob who smokes all over the house, leaves food lying around and, when he's not looking for a job, starts following a woman around town who strikes his fancy.
NEW YORK -- Currency traders returned to a strategy that some say is the only clear bet they can make: buy Europe, sell Japan.</br></br>What that amounted to was the same market pattern repeated on numerous occasions in recent weeks -- the dollar falling against the mark, but rising against the yen, alongside a healthy rally in mark/yen.</br></br>Analysts said Tuesday's quarter-percentage-point cut in the U.S. Fed funds rate suggests the Federal Reserve will make additional easings before year end, a process many believe will weigh on the dollar. Lower U.S. interest rates make dollar-denominated assets less attractive.</br></br>Notwithstanding recent signs that German Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder favors softer monetary policy, the Bundesbank is believed to be adamantly opposed to German rate cuts. Add to this situation some additional bad news on Japanese banks yesterday and mark/yen looked like a strong buy, traders said.</br></br>"Mark/yen has been the favorite play of the past few weeks. If [the mark] gets through the 82/83 yen level, it will look like people are really coming back to start selling yen again," said John McCarthy, vice president, foreign exchange, at ING Barings Capital Markets in New York.

He thought that represented a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½flattening of the curve,ï¿½Û and showed the effects of the many measures taken to stabilize the economy.</br></br>He said there was some disappointment in fall buying. He acknowledged, too, that there has been an increase in unemployment. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½On the other hand,ï¿½Û he continued, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the demand for money is just as great as ever, and every day I have complaints brought to my office (as to) why donï¿½Ûªt 1 print some money or do anything else and get it to the public.ï¿½Û
NEW YORK, July 9ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock market prices tumbled to new lows for the year today amid continuing concern over the fate of the income tax surcharge and the even stronger anti-inflation steps that might be taken if the surtax is permitted to expire.</br></br>Without any rush of trading ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½brokers said there were no signs of panicky sellingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½prices fell steadily from the opening bell. Major market indicators were near their lowest levels of the day at the close.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished with a loss of 8.75 points at 561.62, well below the previous bottom of 869.76 touched on June 27. It was the Dowï¿½Ûªs lowest close since April 1, 1968, when it finished at 861.25. Only one of the 30 stocks in the average was able to gain ground, one was unchanged and 28 fell. At that, it was better than on Tuesday, when all 30 stocks dropped.</br></br>Standard and Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock composite was down 0.75 point to 968 and the New York Stock Exchange index lost 0.42 point to 53,70.</br></br>For the second day in a row, the Exchangeï¿½Ûªs ticker tape was able to keep pace with trading throughout the day. At the close, 9.32 million shares had changed hands, exactly the same total as on Tuesday. Brokers were mixed in reaction to the relatively low turnover. Some saw it as a sign that the selling may be running out, while others are hoping for a technical ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½selling climaxï¿½Û to clear the way for a rebound.
Ordinarily when Fannie Mae announces its quarterly earnings, chief financial officer Timothy Howard has a conference call with analysts and talks for the better part of an hour about the numbers that drive the performance of Washington's biggest business.</br></br>Interest rate trends; comprehensive net interest margins; what it costs Fannie to borrow money, compared with what it costs the U.S. Treasury; LIBOR rates; T-bill spreads--it adds up to billions of dollars measured off in basis points, each of which is one one- hundredth of a percentage point.</br></br>But this month, when Fannie put out its second-quarter financials, the conference call was dominated not by the jargon of Wall Street, but the spin control of Washington. Thomas E. Donilon, Fannie's executive vice president for law and policy, took over the teleconference and made a point of introducing Arne Christenson, senior vice president for regulatory policy. Christenson was, Donilon reminded the Wall Streeters, chief of staff to Newt Gingrich when he was House speaker.</br></br>When your chief executive, Franklin Raines, used to be President Clinton's budget director and your vice chairman, Jamie Gorelick, is Clinton's former deputy attorney general, it's important for the politically naive numbers nerds on Wall Street to understand that you have a balanced offense. Because from that point on in the call, it was pure politics.</br></br>"We manage our political risk with the same intensity we manage our other risks," proclaimed Donilon, assuring investors they do not have to worry about all the bad things being said in Washington about Fannie Mae.
Benchmark Treasury bonds strengthened on Monday, underscoring the appeal of highly-liquid assets as the end of the year approaches.</br></br>In late-afternoon trading, the yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell to 2.157% from 2.178% Friday.</br></br>When bond yields fall, their yields rise.</br></br>Traders said the buying reflected some tweaking of bond portfolios and that the price moves might have been exaggerated by thinner trading before Thursday's Christmas holiday.</br></br>"It just shows a continuation of demand for longer-dated Treasury bonds'' which have rallied during the course of 2014, said Scott Buchta, head of fixed-income strategy at Brean Capital LLC. "Trading volumes have begun to settle down as many accounts begin to close out their books for 2014."
MIAMI -- Even wealthy, fugitive bankers get the blues.</br></br>"Bankers might be thought to have souls of glass and hearts of stone, but we are human beings," says Gustavo Gomez Lopez in a telephone call from an undisclosed location in Europe. A Venezuelan judge wants to extradite Mr. Gomez Lopez, 44 years old, back to Caracas, where he is wanted on charges of fraud connected to the spectacular failure of Banco Latino, the country's second-largest bank.</br></br>Like most of Banco Latino's directors and top officials, Mr. Gomez Lopez, the bank's former chairman, hurriedly left Venezuela weeks before an arrest warrant was issued for him after the bank's collapse in January 1994. The bank's failure sparked a run on Venezuela's currency that plunged the nation into its worst economic crisis.</br></br>Since then, Mr. Gomez Lopez has been followed abroad by a grab-bag of presidents, top executives and directors from the 17 banks that eventually tanked in the financial panic that followed the government's 83-day closing of Banco Latino. Ultimately, Venezuelan judges issued arrest warrants for 322 bankers and leading businessmen blamed for the debacle that cost the Venezuelan government some $7 billion.</br></br>About half of those facing arrest warrants have scattered into exile of varying degrees of comfort in London, Madrid, and other European capitals, and a good number settled in the U.S. Many are in the Miami area, less than three hours from Caracas by jet and a long-favored playground for Venezuelans.
AIRLINES ARE INCREASINGLY paying other companies to do their maintenance for them. But it has become painfully clear that the Federal Aviation Administration doesn't spend enough time checking up on these outside repair shops.</br></br>Last week, the National Transportation Safety Board cited sloppy maintenance and lax federal oversight as contributors to last year's fatal crash of a US Airways commuter flight in Charlotte, N.C., operated by Air Midwest. It's not the first time: The safety board has also said federal maintenance oversight was an issue in the 2000 Alaska Airlines crash off the coast of California, which killed 88 people.</br></br>Aircraft maintenance matters -- a lot. And while great safety strides have been made in many areas of aviation, the recent track record of maintenance oversight is a troubling one for travelers.</br></br>In an effort to hold down costs, airlines now spend an average of 30% of their maintenance dollars at outside vendors. But the FAA has done little to keep tabs on all this work, according to a report last summer from the Department of Transportation's inspector general. Some 97% of inspections done by FAA officials who oversee specific airlines were of the carriers' in-house maintenance shops -- not third-party facilities -- in fiscal year 2002, the report said. While regional inspectors (as opposed to airline-specific staff) do get out to see more of the independent shops, they often have time for only cursory looks, the report said.</br></br>Overall last year, the FAA says 16% of all its maintenance "surveillance activities" -- anytime an inspector looked at something -- were done at outside repair stations.
CHRYSLER HOLDING</br></br>'Old Chrysler' Pays Back</br></br>$1.9 Billion of U.S. Loan</br></br>The U.S Treasury Department said Monday it received a $1.9 billion payment from the bankrupt assets of Chrysler Holding to cover a loan given to the company's former main lending arm, Chrysler Financial.</br></br>"This repayment, while less than face value, is significantly more than the Treasury expected to recover on this loan, and is greater than an independent valuation of the loan . . ." the Treasury said in a statement. The Treasury, then under the Bush Administration, originally made a $4 billion loan to the company in January 2009.
There, in the Ritz-Carlton ballroom Monday, stood Vernon Jordan -- the political insider, corporate networker and financial rainmaker, tall and impeccably turned out -- presiding over his last meeting as head of the Economic Club of Washington.</br></br>During his four-year tenure, Jordan had used his incomparable connections to bring the heads of J.P. Morgan Chase, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, American Express, Pfizer and General Electric, along with the secretary of the Treasury, the chairman of the Federal Reserve and the president of the United States, to speak to 400 of the city's top business executives.</br></br>Now, for his final act, Jordan had reached beyond the Old Economy establishment and snared the chief executive of Google, the hottest company on the planet. Jordan had met Eric Schmidt the year before at Bilderberg, the super-secret gathering that falls between Davos and Bohemian Grove on the calendars of the global elite. By the end of that three-day meeting in Istanbul, Jordan had snared his final speaker.</br></br>Depending on your point of view, Jordan represents everything that is right or wrong with Washington.</br></br>To the cynical and conspiratorial, Jordan epitomizes the clubby and back-scratching Washington power broker, an amoral fixer who uses his web of connections to enrich himself and his clients while corrupting the political process.
President Clinton and his allies in Congress are calling for another increase in the minimum wage. But they should consider the experience of small-business owners like me, who struggled through the last increase. I own and manage a small cafe. I have had as many as 16 employees; I now have nine. Most of them are teenagers; the rest, working mothers.</br></br>Before the last increase I wrote letters to the president and my congressmen. I explained that the mandated wage increase was only the tip of the iceberg. To maintain the wage increment for senior employees, I would have to raise their wages above the new minimum. My monthly payroll would increase by $570 -- and that didn't include the payroll taxes for Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance and workman's compensation. For my efforts I received nicely worded form letters about the benefits of the wage increase.</br></br>When the increase passed, I had to reduce staffing hours. Result: I am working harder to earn my money. I already worked six days a week, every week. The staffing cutbacks increased my workload by 15 hours a week. I also cut back on outside services, so I am now mopping my own floors two weeks each month and doing all my own accounting, the weekly laundry and as many of the repairs as I can.</br></br>When Mr. Clinton signed the wage increase into law, he had by his side a minimum-wage worker who stated that now she did not have to choose between paying her electric bill or her gas bill. The same evening, our local news interviewed a woman who said she would now be able to buy her daughter a compact disk player for graduation. I do not begrudge either of these women their good fortune. But business owners work hard too, and we also have to make tough choices. I suffer from several chronic illnesses, and the wage increase has forced me to cut back on medical care.</br></br>Money for minimum wage increases has to come from somewhere. Mr. Clinton's proposed increase would raise my annual payroll by $7,200, forcing me to close my doors. To the politicians I say this: You have the power to destroy the American Dream for thousands of small-business owners. If you pass another increase in the minimum wage, you can tell the teenagers and working mothers I employ why they no longer have jobs. Then try asking for their votes.
Author: Kenan Machado, Romit Guha; Satish Sarangaraja</br></br>HYDERABAD -- Satyam Computer Services Ltd., which is recovering from India's biggest-ever corporate scandal, said Wednesday its net loss for the fiscal year ended March 31 narrowed to 1.25 billion rupees ($27.8 million) from 81.77 billion rupees a year earlier, as the company's one-time costs fell sharply while it reduced staff and administrative expenses.</br></br>Satyam Computer hadn't reported results since the July-September quarter of 2008, as in January 2009 it was plunged into turmoil after its founder and then chairman, B. Ramalinga Raju, confessed to overstating profits for years, using a fictitious cash balance of more than $1 billion.</br></br>The Hyderabad-based company was taken over by software company Tech Mahindra Ltd. following a government auction in April 2009 and re-branded Mahindra Satyam, though it is still listed as Satyam Computer Services.</br></br>Satyam said Wednesday it posted revenue of 54.81 billion rupees last fiscal year, down from 88.13 billion rupees the previous year, but in line with expectations. The average view in a Dow Jones Newswires poll of five analysts was for revenue of 54.74 billion rupees. The analysts' net profit estimates ranged from 1.80 billion rupees to 6.57 billion rupees.
BOISE, Idaho -- Before the recession hit, Idaho, Nevada and Utah had some of the lowest rates of food stamp use in the nation. It was a boom time in a region that has always prided itself on self-reliance and a disdain for government handouts.</br></br>But since the recession began, these three states have the fastest growth rates in the nation of participation in the federal program, recently released figures show. Utah saw a nearly 34% jump in food-stamp participation in December from the same month a year earlier, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Nevada had the second fastest growth rate at 25%, followed by Idaho at 24%.</br></br>For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, those three states plus Wyoming ranked among the top 10 in food-stamp growth, with Idaho leading with a 42% jump from 2009, according to USDA figures.</br></br>It's a striking shift for the area, reflecting a post-boom fallout that has been compounded by the many new residents drawn to the region by a hot economy who lacked a support network when jobs disappeared.</br></br>"This is a pick-you-up-by-the-bootstraps type of state, which is why the food-stamp participation has [historically] been low," said Rose Andueza, program manager of Idaho's Division of Welfare. "But I think now people have just run out of options."
COBLESKILL, N.Y. -- Here in rural upstate New York, Tom Putnam heads an increasingly endangered species in the booming mutual-fund business: an independent fund company that wants to stay that way.</br></br>Mr. Putnam is chairman, chief executive officer and portfolio manager of Fenimore Asset Management, which runs FAM Funds, a family of two mutual funds with about $380 million in assets. The company, named after author James Fenimore Cooper, traces its roots back to the early 1970s, when Mr. Putnam's father sold the family textile business and invested the proceeds in the stock market.</br></br>Having survived almost 25 years, (the company managed private money before opening the first of two mutual funds in 1987) Mr. Putnam says he's laying the groundwork to survive solo the next 25 years, and hopefully longer -- despite a growing consensus that small fund companies can't make it on their own in the highly competitive mutual-fund business.</br></br>Recently, mutual funds have been a hot commodity in the takeover game. They're commanding billion-dollar price tags amid an unprecedented wave of consolidation, spurred in large part by the theory on Wall Street that fund companies will need to gain size and name recognition to attract the attention of an increasingly fund-savvy investing public.</br></br>The fund merger wave began several years ago and now even the most independent fund proprietors -- such as Dick Strong of the Strong Funds -- are for the first time weighing their options. It is no coincidence that Goldman, Sachs & Co. -- one of the biggest investment-bank players in mutual-fund merger business -- is set to release a new study this week to support a somewhat self-serving theory that smallto midsize fund firms must consolidate in order to remain competitive.
NEW YORK -- Under attack by its own listed companies and powerful floor traders, the New York Stock Exchange is considering reinstituting a "collar" on program trading that it abandoned last year, according to people familiar with the Big Board.</br></br>The exchange also may step up its disclosure of firms engaged in program trading, these people said.</br></br>Big Board officials wouldn't comment publicly. But in an interview in which he called the stock market's volatility a "national problem," Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. said, "We are going to try to do some things in the short intermediate term" to help the situation.</br></br>Mr. Phelan has been viewed by many exchange members as being indifferent to stock-price swings caused by program trades. He said he is "very surprised" by the furor over program trading and the exchange's role in it that has raged in recent days.</br></br>Mr. Phelan said that the Big Board has been trying to deal quietly with the issue, but that banning computer-assisted trading strategies entirely, as some investors want, would be like "taking everybody out of an automobile and making them ride a horse."
LONDON, Fob. 27 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Bank of England raised the British bank rate today in an apparent bid to clamp down on consumer spending and enforce the government's credit-squeeze program.</br></br>The rate, which Is the basis for all the countryï¿½Ûªs Interest rates, was moved forward to 8 per centï¿½ï¿½ï¿½an increase of one per cent. The move puts the bank rate at the same level established during the crisis of 1967 when the pound was devalued.</br></br>In effect-the rate is the equivalent of the discount rate in the United States, except that it is set by the Bank of England instead of the Federal Reserve Board. All the countryï¿½Ûªs interest rates are set according to it.</br></br>The increase came as a shock to financiers in London who viewed it as a savage move to tighten the nationï¿½Ûªs economy.	.	v	'</br></br>The decision was taken because figures, due to be published Friday, show that the big banks increased lending in the four weeks to mid-February instead of gradually decreasing as the government planned, A target reduction of $360 million by mid-March
HANOVER, N.H.--An increasingly confident Mitt Romney is looking beyond his Republican rivals and again focusing his attacks on President Barack Obama, using a three-day swing through New Hampshire to frame his candidacy as a choice between the president's "entitlement society" and the "merit society" Mr. Romney envisions.</br></br>In an interview late Wednesday, Mr. Romney reflected a new tone--a more biting version of his earlier rhetoric against the president--predicting Mr. Obama will resort to "a politics of envy and divisiveness and demonizing of business and business people that will shock" voters.</br></br>"A campaign of envy and class warfare, I think, will ultimately be unsuccessful, whether in the primary or in the general election," he said. "I can surely tell you that Republicans will not warm to a campaign that is attacking success."</br></br>In what amounts to his closing argument before voters decide early next month in Iowa and New Hampshire, the former Massachusetts governor is hoping to transcend the recent squabbles of the primary race and train his sights on a general election that he and his aides now believe is within reach.</br></br>Many Republicans remain ambivalent about Mr. Romney, and polls still show a tight national race. But Mr. Romney's position has improved in recent days as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has seen his support weaken in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
THE STOCK MARKET's three-day rally slowed on profit-taking and weakness in the bond market. Volume, however, reached 203 million shares. Bond prices slid on investor worries over the interest-rate outlook and U.S. borrowing needs.</br></br>Some brokerage firms are posting increases in stock business of 50% to 100% from a week ago, but are divided over advice to investors.</br></br>---</br></br>Merrill Lynch agreed to acquire Becker Paribas in a stock transaction valued at $100 million. Cie. Financiere de Paribas apparently decided to divest the unit partly because of fixed-income securities trading losses, said to exceed $60 million.</br></br>---
THE U.S. STOCK MARKET is showing some signs of recovery, but there is a problem lurking in the background: foreigners.</br></br>Foreign investors, whose purchases in 2000 almost equaled those of U.S. equity mutual funds and who were steady buyers even last year, have pulled their horns in. They aren't quite net sellers yet, but their net buying has almost dried up.</br></br>That helps explain why the market has been soft -- especially the stocks of big, well-known companies favored by foreign investors -- and why the dollar has been under pressure.</br></br>The risk is that the disenchantment with U.S. stocks could continue and that foreign investors could even become net sellers, further hurting the U.S. market. "Foreign demand for U.S. assets is coming under strain," says Paul Meggyesi, a senior foreign-exchange analyst at Deutsche Bank. "With little sign of improvement in the U.S. asset market this is a problem which we believe will continue for some time to come.</br></br>Last week, stocks rose led by continued demand for technology shares in particular. The Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 8.8%, or 140.54 points, to 1741.39 following five straight days of gains. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, meanwhile, was up 4.2%, or 413.16 points, from a week earlier to 10353.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index also gained 4.9% for the week.
NEW YORK -- Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. sought to restructure $624 million of debt at its Jim Walter Corp. unit to head off potential troubles stemming from turmoil in the junk bond market and from asbestos-related lawuits.</br></br>Hillsborough Holdings Corp., a company that KKR set up when it bought Jim Walter in a $3.3 billion leveraged buy-out in January 1988, began an exchange offer for $624 million of junk bonds whose interest rate is scheduled to be reset by Dec. 2.</br></br>Hillsborough is offering to pay bondholders about $3 million in cash and increase the interest rates paid on the bonds by about a percentage point, in order to avoid a reset procedure that might result in interest rates above 20% because of the current slump in the junk bond market. The Hillsborough bonds now have interest rates ranging from 14.5% to 16.625%.</br></br>In addition, officials of Hillsborough said the company is seeking to extend the repayment terms of some of its $257 million of bank debt, of which about $200 million is currently scheduled to be repaid in 1991. In exchange for a longer repayment schedule, Hillsborough would agree to pay off some bank debt early with some of the proceeds from an expected financing of the company's coal mines.</br></br>The potential troubles at Jim Walter follows several months of debt restructuring at Seaman Furniture Co., a much smaller company that KKR also bought last year. In addition, the difficulties with the Hillsborough reset bonds could presage similar troubles next year with reset securities issued in its acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc., if the junk bond market doesn't recover.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices edged higher yesterday. But trading volume was light as dealers and investors awaited a large supply of new U.S. government securities this holiday-shortened week.</br></br>The Treasury today is scheduled to auction $5.5 billion of new seven-year notes. On Thursday, it plans to sell $4 billion of new 20-year, one-month bonds.</br></br>That will complete the government's $15.5 billion midyear financing operation, which began last Tuesday with the sale of $6 billion of four-year notes at an average yield of 13.69%. Some analysts contend that yields will have to rise in order to attract investors to the new Treasury notes and bonds.</br></br>Yields on both issues "need to move closer to 14% before we get any significant investor" demand, said Samuel Kahan, a vice president of Heinold Commodities Inc., Chicago.</br></br>Late yesterday, the seven-year Treasury notes were trading in the when-issued market to yield about 13.85%. The 20-year, one-month bonds closed at about 13.75% in when-issued trading.
NEW YORK, Sept. 26ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock prices were mixed today as investors waited for Tuesdayï¿½Ûªs meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which may decide to boost interest rates for the sixth time this year.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 17.49 points to 3849.24. But declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 7 to 6 on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading volume fell to 270.8 million shares from 297.6 million shares Friday.</br></br>Other market indicators heavily weighted with NYSE listings advanced: The NYSE composite index rose 0.58 points to 254.39, and the Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock index gained 1.15 to 460,82. But the Nasdaq index ended down 1.83 to 755.63, and the American Stock Exchange index declined 1.45 to 453.78.</br></br>Blue-chip stocks were boosted by speculation that the market would rally on Tuesday, whether or not the Fed raises short-term interest rates.</br></br>Analysts said the consensus on Wall Street was that the central bank would not raise rates Tuesday but rather would wait for further data on inflation and the strength of the economy.
It's been difficult to pin an ideological tail on the nascent Bush White House. One day the president is called a staunch conservative for nominating John D. Ashcroft to run the Justice Department and acting to restrict U.S. funding to overseas groups that support abortions. The next he's labeled a bleeding heart for helping prisoners' children and promoting literacy programs.</br></br>The problem, some Bush advisers and friends say, is that conventional political definitions do not adequately explain what the president is trying to do. His actions have less to do with the left vs. right, they say, than with his embrace of many of the ideas contained in the movement known as "communitarianism," which places the importance of society ahead of the unfettered rights of the individual.</br></br>"This is the ultimate Third Way," said Don Eberly, an adviser in the Bush White House, using a favorite phrase of President Bill Clinton, who also sought, largely unsuccessfully, to redefine the debate with an alternative to the liberal-conservative conflict. "The debate in this town the last eight years was how to forge a compromise on the role of the state and the market. This is a new way to rethink social policy: a major reigniting of interest in the social sector." "Communitarianism," or "civil society" thinking (the two have similar meanings) has many interpretations, but at its center is a notion that years of celebrating individual freedom have weakened the bonds of community and that the rights of the individual must be balanced against the interests of society as a whole. Inherent in the philosophy is a return to values and morality, which, the school of thought believes, can best be fostered by community organizations. "We need to connect with one another. We've got to move a little more in the direction of community in the balance between community and the individual," said Robert D. Putnam of Harvard University, a leading communitarian thinker.</br></br>Many of Bush's early proposals fit this approach. This week, Bush moved to make it easier for the government to fund religious groups that cater to the poor and disadvantaged. He also gave a boost to AmeriCorps, the national service program that sends volunteers to help community initiatives. Last week, Bush rolled out an education plan that gave localities more authority over their schools. A week earlier, he spoke of the need for character education in schools. Even his tax plan, due next week, has what are touted as community- building elements: a new charitable tax credit, a charitable deduction for those who don't itemize, and a reduction of the marriage penalty.</br></br>Bush's inaugural address, said George Washington University professor Amitai Etzioni, a communitarian thinker, "was a communitarian text," full of words like "civility," "responsibility" and "community." That's no accident: Bush's advisers consulted on the speech with Putnam. At the same time, Bush has recruited some of the leading thinkers of the "civil society," or "communitarian," movements to his White House: former Indianapolis mayor Stephen Goldsmith, University of Pennsylvania professor John DiIulio, fatherhood advocate Eberly, speechwriters Michael Gerson and Peter Wehner. Even Lawrence B. Lindsey, long before becoming Bush's economics adviser, was a Federal Reserve governor who explored ways to lure capital to rebuild poor urban communities.
A $910 million settlement of an investor class action lawsuit alleging that 30 brokerage firms conspired to rig prices on the Nasdaq Stock Market has been given preliminary approval by a federal judge. In New York, U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet allowed attorneys in the case to place newspaper advertisements notifying investors of their eligibility to collect money under the settlement. The judge is expected to hold another hearing next year before deciding whether to give the settlement final approval.</br></br>Sales of existing homes edged 0.2 percent lower in November from a record level the month before, a trade group said. Existing single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.38 million units last month, down from 4.39 million units in October, the National Association of Realtors said. The drop was the result of declines in the Northeast and Midwest.</br></br>The Justice Department sued to block Alcoa's $250 million purchase of Reynolds Metals' aluminum mill and other property in Alabama. The department, in a suit filed in federal court in Alabama, alleged that the acquisition would lead to higher prices for aluminum used to make beverage cans. It noted that Alcoa doesn't plan to reopen a Muscle Shoals aluminum rolling mill that Reynolds will close before selling the plant to Alcoa. Richmond-based Reynolds said its legal team will review its options before it comments further. Alcoa officials were not available for comment.</br></br>Bethlehem Steel, unable to turn its coke plant in Bethlehem, Pa., into a profitable operation, said it intends to close the plant by March 31. The nation's second-biggest steelmaker said it would try to sell the plant, which employs 800 workers, but that no buyers have emerged. Coke is used in making steel.</br></br>Shaw Industries, a carpet manufacturer and retailing giant, said it plans to close 100 stores in a move affecting 600 employees. Shaw has about 24,000 employees. The Dalton, Ga.-based company said it would take a special fourth-quarter charge of $36.3 million -- roughly 17 cents a share, or $22.8 million after taxes -- to cover the costs.
REMEMBER THE BEST-SELLING book, "Dow 36,000: The New Strategy for Profiting From the Coming Rise in the Stock Market"?</br></br>With stocks plunging, and many giddy investors who swore by the book now burning it, the authors must be sheepishly admitting how foolish and wrong they were, right?</br></br>Well, no.</br></br>Even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 24% below where it was when "Dow 36,000" was published in September 1999, the two authors -- financial writer James K. Glassman and economist Kevin A. Hassett -- insist the stock market will prove them right. Someday. They're just not saying when.</br></br>"Oh, yeah, definitely. I'm just not going to give you a date," responds an unapologetic Mr. Glassman, when asked whether Dow 36000 is still on the horizon, even though it topped out, on a closing basis, at 11722.98 on Jan. 14, 2000.
WASHINGTON--Bruce Reed, a former Clinton administration official who now heads the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, has been tapped to be executive director of President Barack Obama's fiscal commission.</br></br>Mr. Reed's appointment, announced Thursday in a statement by panel co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles, rounds out the bipartisan commission, whose 18 sitting members have already been named by Mr. Obama and congressional leaders from both parties.</br></br>The group, created in an executive order last month, has been given the task of finding ways to bring down the U.S.'s soaring deficit, with a goal of slashing the budget gap to around 3% of gross domestic product from its projected level of around 11% this year. The panel will send its recommendations, likely to be a mix of tax increases and cuts to federal benefit programs Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and other federal spending, to Congress by Dec. 1.</br></br>Mr. Reed was President Bill Clinton's top domestic-policy adviser, helping to write the 1996 welfare-reform bill and enact the administration's education agenda. More recently, he co-authored a book with Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff.</br></br>"The Commission will benefit from Bruce's years of experience in public policy to help us complete our challenging and crucial work," Mr. Simpson said.
The U.S. housing market, which helped buoy a sagging economy earlier this winter, took it on the chin in December as home sales tumbled.</br></br>Sales of existing homes fell 7.4% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.87 million units, 5.3% below the 5.14-million-unit pace in December 1999. Most economists had expected sales in the range of five million to 5.1 million units. For the full year, home sales totaled 5.03 million units in 2000. That was down 3.2% from 1999, which was a record year for home sales.</br></br>Economists found the December data troubling, especially when taken with other reports suggesting the market slowed down at year's end. The Commerce Department said last week that while housing starts were up slightly in December, permit applications fell 6.6%. Also, the most recent monthly survey by the National Association of Home Builders found builders are less optimistic about the market than before.</br></br>While all that doesn't add up to a major slowdown, the latest sales data "suggest there is a yellow flag for housing," says David Lereah, the realtors' chief economist. "Not a red flag yet, but a yellow flag." He says the numbers should help assure that the Federal Reserve will lower rates by at least one-quarter of a percentage point when it meets early next week.</br></br>Many economists, however, cautioned against placing too much stock in the December data. For one thing, weather was extremely bad, and even though the data are adjusted for that, the formulas used rely heavily on data from recent years when weather was unseasonably warm.
Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), the incoming House Banking Committee chairman, praised the Federal Reserve's monetary policies yesterday and said he hopes to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½keep a very powerful roleï¿½Û for the agency in regulating tanks.</br></br>Leachï¿½Ûªs comments are in stark contrast to steady criticisms leveled at the Fed by the current committee chairman, Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.). Gonzalez has been sharply critical of the Fedï¿½Ûªs interest rate increases this year and has pressed it to be more open about its policy deliberations.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think the Fed is moving in the right direction" on interest rates, Leach told reporters yesterday after speaking to an investors' conference.</br></br>In his speech. Leach also praised the Fed in its role as bank regulator. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½1 have a very strong personal desire to keep politics out of bank supervision," Leach said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and the Fed of all institutions in American politics is above politics. ... It is the place</br></br>Last year, the Clinton administration proposed consolidating federal banking regulators in a single agen-
An early-retirement program set up four years ago has cost Virginia's government far more money than it saved, a new audit says, raising concern among some officials that the state may be heading down the same road this year with a round of worker buyouts.</br></br>The 1991 retirement plan pared the state's work force by 3,535 employees and saved $37 million at a time when Virginia was hard-pressed to balance its budget because of the recession. But the state's independent auditor reports that so many of the jobs were refilled that savings in future years were negated.</br></br>The report said that as many as two-thirds of the workers who left some of the state's largest agencies were replaced later, meaning that the state wound up paying for the positions even as its retirement system was saddled with $238 million in additional liability.</br></br>The report comes at a time when Gov. George Allen (R) has embarked on an even more ambitious program to slash state government, not because of economic troubles but because of his belief that Virginia's bureaucracy has become too large and unwieldy.</br></br>A buyout program that took effect this month will result in the voluntary departures of 5,470 employees -- about 5 percent of the state's payroll -- and Allen administration officials predicted today that the state would save $368 million during the next four years as a result.
WASHINGTON -- The Conference Board's composite index of leading indicators slipped in September for the fourth straight month, signaling that the economic soft patch will persist.</br></br>Separately, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the number of workers filing first-time applications for unemployment benefits dropped by an unexpectedly steep 25,000 last week, a decline that may have been skewed by the holiday-shortened week.</br></br>The Conference Board, a private research group in New York, reported that its composite index of leading indicators fell by 0.1% to a reading of 115.6 in September, after August's 0.3% decline. The slightness of the declines in the past four months seems to argue against invoking the economists' rule of thumb that three consecutive declines in the index signal a recession.</br></br>"While the leading index is not yet signaling a downturn, the growth rate of the leading index has slowed," said Ken Goldstein, an economist with the Conference Board. Economic growth should continue, but more slowly than expected, he added. The index is designed to predict the economy's path during the next three to six months.</br></br>Oil prices have had a negative impact on the economy, but not enough to produce a broad spike in inflation. Recent hurricanes may also have held down economic activity, the Conference Board said.
^President Ford went W Kansas City three weeks, ago to talk about the economy and list 10 ways to beat inflation. A key recommen: dation was energy conservation.</br></br>According to the White House, the President flew 16,685 miles campaigning for Republican candidates at 26 stops.</br></br>C Financed by the Republican National Committee, Mr. Ford visited such widely scattered spots as Burlington, Vt., Portland, Ore., Greenville, S.C., and Los Angeles.</br></br>an hour traVeling~at its "new speed of 475. miles ' an .hour, instituted during last yearï¿½Ûªs energy crisis.</br></br>A back-up ï¿½Û¢ plane, a C-141 carrying equipment and support personnel, uses 1,800 gallons of fuel an hour fly-* ing at about the same speed.
THEY HAVE BEEN thinking the unthinkable again in certain quarters of government, and the question now is whether they are also going to try to do the non-doable. Some time in the next few days, the president is expected to decide just how much money he will ask from Congress for a stepped-up program of civil defense. Around $95 million annually has already been dished out for this confused and wasteful program; and only recently has the government arranged to free up those funds for expenditure on more manageable and familiar, if less exotic, emergencies than those likely to attend nuclear war. Now there are pressures on Mr. Carter to add substantially to these funds for the purpose of getting a civil-defense evacuation project under way. The current scuttlebutt has it that he is resisting. We fervently hope this is the case.</br></br>Since the advent of nuclear explosives and of missiles that can hurl them halfway around the world in a matter of minutes, the subject of civil defense has been transformed, although some of the advocates of an enlarged American program do not acknowledge that fact. When you talk of protecting civilian populations and industrial plants against destruction in nuclear war, you must be talking either of a gigantic and gigantically expensive burrowing and dispersal processï¿½ï¿½ï¿½or of nothing. The much written- and wor-ried-about Soviet civil-defense efforts, for example, that are regularly cited as evidence that the Russians are developing a decisive advantage over us for any future nuclear confrontation, could all be confounded or overcome by various adjustments of a nuclear offense. And the literature that holds otherwise, spinning out its clinical we-do-this-then-they-do-that scenarios is just that: literatureï¿½ï¿½ï¿½tidy imaginings of how the thing might go on paper, but surely not in bloody, rubble-strewn, irradiated, wires-down and switchboards-out reality.</br></br>All right, the unconvinced reply, but whatï¿½Ûªs wrong with trying to do what we canï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that which is at least feasibleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½by way of protecting what we reasonably can from possible obliteration? The answer is that except for a few really rock-bottom, minimal steps, there is just no civil defense possible that, in practical terms, would not require ever greater and greater expenditures and exertions and distortions of the peacetime civilian life we live to have any prospect of war-worthiness at all. And even then, it couldnï¿½Ûªt work, and would thus constitute a cruelly deceptive promise of substantially cutting down civilian casualties. Where is it exactly that all those Soviet citizens are meant to be trudging to for the several days it is expected to take them to evacuate their cities? What exactly is- it that they are going to build to shelter themselves in when they get there? And with what materials? Who will be carrying the food and water and from whereï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and over what kind of terrain and clogged (with people and vehicles) roads? What we should be telling the Soviets, again and again and in every way we know, is that itï¿½Ûªs a rotten enterprise and canï¿½Ûªt be expected to workï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not: Hey, you seem to have a terrific idea there; but you canï¿½Ûªt get the better of us; weï¿½Ûªre going to do it too.</br></br>If anything, the Soviet pursuit of a civil-defense program has illustrated precisely one of the dangers that go with it: digging in (no matter how ineffective) or even seeming -to, will never look defensive to the other side; rather, to those charged with protecting a nationï¿½Ûªs security it will always project the image of an enemy preparing to fight a war. Thus, it is likely to alarm and provoke an opponent; and it may also generate a false and dangerous sense of confidence, bordering on arrogance, on the part of those who construct some kind of civil-defense capability. You can see some of the psychological harm in the very reaction of this country to the Sovietï¿½Ûªs activities in the field. But that at least is in a relatively tension-free, long-term planning context. Only consider what the impact would be on a different time and danger scale ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½at a moment of high-tension during a superpower confrontation that engaged each countryï¿½Ûªs vital interestsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½if one side or the other started evacuating its cities. Do you think the evacuees would get very far? How would you assess the contribution of their mass exodus to the triggering of actual warfare?</br></br>It is occasionally said that those who oppose the development of a civil-defense capacity in this country are arrogant themselves and unfeeling,, in that they, seem eager to will total doom in a nuclear exchange and evince no concern for the millions of lives that might be saved by some prudent advance-planning. Baloney. If there is arrogance afoot, it is the cosmic, Faustian arrogance of those who believe that nuclear warfare can be tamed and made manageable, who in-tellectualize and make antisceptic the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½scenariosï¿½Û of what it'would be like and who now suggest to the rest of us that it will be our own fault if we end up casualties. Never mind that all this is dressed up in humanitarian, let-us-save-what-we-can garb. Embarking on a civil-defense program in a nuclear-missile age is one of the worst ideas ever tossed into public discussion. The president should toss it out.
More Travelers</br></br>Hitting the Road</br></br>AMERICANS ARE TAKING to the family car for vacation this summer, and road-trip specialists are in hot pursuit.</br></br>Eighty percent of vacationers will travel by car this year, up 4% from 1993, according to the American Automobile Association. By contrast, 16% will go by airplane, and 3% by bus and train. The price of an auto vacation has run well behind the pace of inflation over the past 10 years, says Graeme R. Clarke, an AAA vice president. "It continues to be a fantastic bargain."</br></br>Small businesses are hoping to take advantage of the boom. In Darien, Ill., 52-year-old Ken Reinhart has started a one-man company, called 48 States by Car, which creates a personalized itinerary for road trips -- with hotel reservations, restaurant recommendations and a list of radio stations along the way. The itinerary, which costs $70, takes about three weeks to develop and comes with travel brochures. "I'll give you recommendations for everything," says Mr. Reinhart, a retired physical education teacher. "I really try to make the vacation mine."
Inflation is no bogeyman. It is a destructive force that hits the rich and poor, the prudent and the extravagant, the wise and the foolish. But that is no reason for us to give blind allegiance to all the soothsayers and pessimists who would deny the progress we are making in raising the living standards of the people and in strengthening the United States against economic shocks.</br></br>The scaremongering ads and inspired articles of the American defeatists conclude that in this process we are being ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½robbed of our savings.*ï¿½Ûª Undeniably the $25 income from the S18.75 United States Saving Bond purchased in 1941 and cashed at maturity in 1951, cannot buy in groceries, clothes, etc., as much as the $18.75 did when you laid it away so confidently 10 years ago.</br></br>Butï¿½ï¿½ï¿½there is a very close relationship between income and ability to save. Thus, when income and employment arc low, people have to spend almost ail of what they earn for living expenses. At the depths of depressions such as 1931-33, not only didnï¿½Ûªt we save but many had to use past savings and even go into debt. On the other hand as incomes and employment expand, total savings increase and the proportion saved out of income rises.</br></br>All during these past 10 years when consumer prices were rising, employment was increasing and incomes were mounting. People were more able to save, more people were saving more. In fact, the United States Treasury figures show that the average ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½liquid assetsï¿½Ûª* held per family (in the form of currency, de-mand deposits and securities)</br></br>The Federal Reserve Board Survey of Consumer Finances shows that 60 percent of all positive savings in 1950 were made by the top 20 percent of our income receivers. Down at the other end of the scale the bottom 20 percent accounted for 3 percent of positive savings. This compares with 66 percent and 2 percent, respectively, for the proportion of savings made by these income groups in 1947.
They laughed here in Washington the other day at a sarcastic scenario for making Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, president of the United States. Now the joke has turned serious.</br></br>For Volcker emerges from his bold move to tighten credit as the dominant figure in economic policy. Jimmy Carter and his advisers have missed an opportunity to develop a broad, comprehensive strategy for the most serious problem facing' the country.</br></br>Volcker, to be sure, has addressed a big part of a big problem. He has changed the way the Fed does business so as to increase interest rates, and make it uncertain as to how high they will eventually go. Those who borrow money to buy goods or finance inventories or speculate in commodities must now. reckon they can be wiped out. Hence the wild fluctuations that characterized markets last week.</br></br>The theory is that by talking very tough the Fed can create uncertainty and thus shatter the expectation of steadily rising prices, which has been at the heart of persistent inflation. It is possibleï¿½ï¿½ï¿½even likelyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that the inflationary surge will taper off in the next few months. But even if the Volcker policy works, it does not pro-</br></br>One is the danger of deep recession. Consumer demand has been faltering for months now, and most economists believe that the latest shot virtually guarantees a prolonged slowdown with high unemployment. Many thoughtful officials inside the administration want to design a program of tax cuts for business that work against both recession and inflation.
As the housing slump caused stocks to slide yesterday, Safeway slipped on a sell rating, Onyx Pharmaceuticals surged on a clinical trial triumph and Altria Group advanced on the prospect of a spinoff.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 56.74, or 0.4%, to 13322.13. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index lost 15.44, or 0.6%, to 2561.25, having fallen back in just two of the past seven sessions. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 12.58, or 0.9%, to 1466.79. The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 78.11, or 0.8%, to 9528.93.</br></br>Investors wanted little to do with stocks after word that existing- home sales fell during July, a fifth-straight decline, while inventories of unsold property climbed and prices dropped. "This showed us how fractured and uncertain the housing market still is," said John Twomey, managing director for institutional equities trading at Merriman Curhan Ford. "Until there are signs of stabilization, what goes on in the housing market will remain an important factor in traders' and investors' decision making."</br></br>Safeway lost $1.05, or 3.2%, to $31.89. Merrill Lynch downgraded the supermarket chain's shares to sell from neutral, expecting them to underperform through the rest of 2007 and likely into 2008.</br></br>Altria Group rose 89 cents, or 1.3%, to 70.08. The tobacco company is expected to announce a spinoff of its Philip Morris International arm after a board meeting tomorrow.
WASHINGTON -- For months, market-watchers and analysts have been on the lookout for any sign that inflation -- largely dormant for years -- may be stirring.</br></br>But the latest gauge, the Labor Department's February producer-price index, which measures prices paid to the nation's farms, factories and refineries, proved inconclusive.</br></br>Inflation hawks could cite the index's larger-than-expected 1% increase, the largest monthly advance since October 1990, as evidence that a broader resurgence may be on the horizon. As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5%, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4% higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months.</br></br>On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3% for the month, with a 6.3% surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1%, the lowest year-over-year change since last November.</br></br>Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 499.19 points -- a record rise when measured by points gained -- to close at 10630.60 as investors poured cash into blue-chip stocks. Bonds, which tend to fall in price on any sign of inflation, actually rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury bond rose 10/32 point, about $3.125 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The issue's yield eased to 6.238%.
After improving in September and early October, markets in a wide variety of debt -- including for home mortgages, consumer loans, and corporate buyouts -- have sharply deteriorated in recent weeks. Investors view much of this debt as riskier than they did even at the height of the August credit crisis and are requiring higher interest rates as compensation.</br></br>While markets are behaving in a more orderly fashion than they were in August, many on Wall Street fear that the situation will get worse before it gets better. "This is just dragging on longer," said Axel Merk, a portfolio manager for Merk Hard Currency Fund. "We're very early in this."</br></br>Economists increasingly worry that banks are suffering such massive losses that they will be forced to cut back their lending to consumers and businesses. That would slow the economy, much as the savings and loan crisis did in the early 1990s. Yesterday, an analyst predicted that Citigroup, the world's biggest financial services company, would suffer another $15 billion in losses in the coming six months from its exposure to exotic types of debt.</br></br>That prediction, along with fresh negative data about the housing market, drove the Dow Jones industrial average down 218 points, or 1.7 percent. Financial markets are pointing to a strong possibility of even more bad news.</br></br>For example, futures markets indicate that there is a 20 percent chance that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by half a percentage point or more at its next policy meeting Dec. 11, even though it is widely understood that the central bank would do so only if there were highly negative economic news between now and then. An index measuring the cost of insuring against credit losses on 125 financially sound companies reached an all-time high yesterday. And the market for securities backed by commercial real estate loans, which had been little affected through the August crunch, is showing strain.
WASHINGTON -- Congressional Democrats have big ambitions but little room to maneuver in this year's restrictive budget climate.</br></br>Lawmakers are hoping to improve health insurance, create new child-care programs and even spend more money on the military, particularly for veterans. But they are hemmed in by the rising cost of the war, the ballooning budget deficit and a law passed last year that strictly limits new spending.</br></br>"There's more and more evidence of social decay, and less and less money to cope with it," says Rep. Thomas Downey (D., N.Y.). "It's tremendously frustrating."</br></br>This strain is largely the product of last year's budget agreement. The new budget law sets strict spending ceilings on all domestic, military and foreign aid appropriations. If one program expands significantly, another program in the same general category must be cut. Lawmakers who want to raise spending in an entitlement program, such as Medicare, must increase taxes or reduce benefits elsewhere.</br></br>Making these constraints even tighter are the costs of the Mideast war, which are estimated to be as much as $1 billion a day. "The war will cost on an annual basis as much as national health insurance would cost," says Rep. David Obey, a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin. "We'll be paying for one and not the other."
After employers greet Gulf war veterans, it won't be business as usual.</br></br>Instead, companies probably will have to wrestle with a host of re-entry adjustments by returnees to the workplace. And, given the brevity of the war, many employers aren't prepared.</br></br>There is still time to get ready: Although a cease-fire has been declared, reservists may not be home for weeks, and in some cases months. But up to now, companies "haven't made adequate preparations for people coming back," says Dee Soder, president of Endymion Co., an executive-advisory firm.</br></br>For example, employers may not have adequate counseling and re-entry programs in place, or low-interest loan programs for cash-squeezed reservists who didn't get supplemental pay. And many companies haven't yet figured out what to do with replacement workers who thought they had a job for at least six months.</br></br>For the most part, employers relied on co-workers to fill in for reservists sent overseas. "A lot of companies were in a recession and felt overstaffed anyway," says Susan Koralik, a partner with Hewitt Associates, an employee-benefit consulting firm. In a Hewitt survey of large companies, 22 said they had spread work out among co-workers, while only three hired temporaries.
The governmentï¿½Ûªs joint effort with business to hire and train the poor ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½may simply be shifting the burden of unemployment from the disadvantaged to other persons not so categorized,ï¿½Û the General Accounting Office said yesterday.</br></br>The GAO, the governmentï¿½Ûªs watchdog over its own spending, also cited ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½strong indications" that the Labor Department is not monitoring Job Opportunities in tlie Business Sector (JOBS) adequately.</br></br>It said some JOBS contracts between the department and private employers appear to' contain unreasonably high costs, to be subject to errors of billing, to commit the companies to hire more persons : than needed, to fail to supply trainees with required serv-i ices and to enlist some work-i ers well above poverty levels.</br></br>In presenting testimony for i the GAO, associate director i Henry Eschwege of the civil I division said ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we are not sur-i prised that it (JOBS) is experi-ï¿½Ûª encing the problems and grow-i ing pains that typically go with a new program.ï¿½Û</br></br>GAOï¿½Ûªs general impression is that the program ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½has served jto focus the attention of businessmen on the need to hire and train the disadvantaged and that it has undoubtedly helped some disadvantaged persons obtain gainful employment,ï¿½Û Eschwege said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We would hope that the results of our review efforts currently under way will serve to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the JOBS program.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½	cials of the business arm of the JOBS program charged that a subcommittee staff and the handling of it in the press had done their efforts irreparable harm.
The House Democratic leadership, fearing defeat by rebellious Democrats in league with Republicans, yesterday reluctantly embraced a plan to add $1 billion to this yearï¿½Ûªs budget to help the crippled housing industry by subsidizing mortgage interest rates.</br></br>Since the Senate Banking Committee has also approved such a plan and the full Senate seems poised to follow suit, the House endorsement makes early congressional approval of some form of mortgage subsidy almost certain.</br></br>Yesterdayï¿½Ûªs agreement by the leadership was reached after it appeared likely that the House would instead approve a bipartisan proposal to take $2 billion in synfuels funding to put into housing, despite the leadershipï¿½Ûªs opposition, congressional sources said.</br></br>Faced with choosing between the devastated but politically powerful housing industry and the ably represented oil industry, the leadership followed a time-honored tradition: it chose both. At the insistence of House Majority Leader James C. Wright Jr. of Texas, all funding is to be retained for the Synthetic Fuels</br></br>Corp., and the $1 billion will be added to the fiscal 1982 urgent supplemental appropriations bill, to go to the House floor next week.
NEW YORK, Fob. 14 fAP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Stock market prices took a pounding today as investors apparently lost their enthusiasm over efforts to resolve international monetary troubles.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 1685 points, declining steadily throughout the day to a 979.91 close. Declining issues far outpaced gainers, 1.202 to 306. among the 1.807 issues traded on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The Amex price-change index fell .14 to 25 47, while losers topped winners by 646 to 263 among the 1.185 Amex issues traded. Volume sank to 2.96 million shares, versus 4.45 million Tuesday.</br></br>In Over-the-Counter trading, the NASDAQ composite index fell 1.77 to 125.42, while the industrial index dropped 1.56 to 124.41.</br></br>CN'A Financial was the Big Boardï¿½Ûªs volume leader today, losing 54 to 16% after a giant 911.400-share block changed hands at 16Vi. It was the 15th-largest block transaction ever recorded at the exchange.
The minister of finance needed a shave. His blue eyes spoke of exhaustion. And when a visitor joked that his open-necked shirt made him look like an Israeli official, he replied that doffing his tie was not just a matter of hot weather.</br></br>"It's because of the people outside!" said Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi, pointing to his door. "Daily, I have 30 to 40 people coming to me to solve their problems. So I have to be nervous!"</br></br>The transition from exiled revolutionaries to home-bound administrators has not been easy for Nashashibi and other members of the Palestinian Authority, sworn in a month ago. But both Israelis and Palestinians say that self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho has gone more smoothly than they had expected.</br></br>"So far, it works," said Israeli Health Minister Ephraim Sneh. "Not 100 percent well, but it's not a failure as some of our opposition people warned us would happen. There is a serious effort on the part of the Palestinian Authority."</br></br>Still, the jubilation with which Palestinians greeted their new government has shriveled in the face of a stubbornly weak economy that has failed to show a "peace dividend." Many shops along Gaza City's main thoroughfare are still closed, and a cleanup of Gaza's rubbish-strewn streets, soon to be launched with a grant from Japan, is sorely needed.
Today, the boomer generation worries about amassing enough money for retirement. Tomorrow will bring another worry: how to make a limited pool of savings last for life.</br></br>That's where annuities come in--the type known as "immediate pay." These annuities guarantee you a permanent income, no matter how long you live.</br></br>They have some drawbacks. But insurers are starting to rethink immediate-pay annuities to make them more salable--especially annuities linked to the performance of stocks.</br></br>You buy an immediate-pay annuity with a lump sum of money. The funds might come from regular savings, stock market gains, a retirement plan, even the cash in a life insurance policy.</br></br>The insurer will turn that money into a lifetime income. The income could also cover the joint lifetimes of you and your spouse. Neither of you would ever run out of cash, no matter how long you lived.
NEW YORK, June 30ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With traders, brokers and analysts deserting Wall Street in droves to start on a four-day weekend, the stock market meandered to a mixed and quiet close today.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial* average padded about with a small gain most of the session, but slid lower in the last hour to finish at 860,26, off 1.68 points. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock composite was down 0.21 point to 90.64 and the New York Stock Exchange index lost 0.08 point to 50.27.</br></br>For most of the day, the market seesawed between traders trying to lighten their load before the weekend and mutual funds intent on dressing up their six-month reports to shareholders. In the end, the forces of caution won a small overall victory.</br></br>7.86	million shares from 9.94 million on Thursday. Rising stocks held on to a small, 603 to 574 margin over losers, compared with the previous dayï¿½Ûªs showing of 446 up and 787 down. New highs dropped to 53 from 81 and new loss rose to 40 from 31.</br></br>Glamor stocks took it on the chin again. Xerox, which has been leading the group down, tried to recover but stumbled and finished with a Y4-point loss at 273 !/4. Polaroid closed down five points at 201V4, its lowest price of the day, Itek was down 1% to 123%, Teledyne was off 2% to 189% and Texas Instruments eased half a point to 114%.
Stocks shot higher today as a late surge gave the Dow Jones industrial average another triple-digit increase and left the blue-chip index just 178 points off its record high.</br></br>The Dow rose 103.50 to 9159.55, giving it a 239.96-point increase for the week, which was dominated by the Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday to lower interest rates by one-quarter percentage point.</br></br>Just six weeks ago, the market had slid below 7500 as investors worried about the world economy. The Dow is now up about 1,275 points for the year, and within sight of its 9337.97 record high reached July 17.</br></br>Stocks pushed higher in many sectors, from drugs to the Internet to telecommunication services. The technology-laden Nasdaq index and broader stock indicators also rose.</br></br>Banks and financial services stocks were among the front-runners as investors grew more confident that lower interest rates will boost the economy with more borrowing and spending.
Is the bond bear market here? Last week's sudden selloff in U.S. Treasurys, which dragged U.K. gilts and German bunds in its wake, has jolted the market. The driving force is a belief the U.S. and global recovery may be becoming self-sustaining.</br></br>Some are recalling the events of 1994, when an unexpected U.S. rate increase caused bond-market carnage. But so far, a rerun looks unlikely given that a sharp rise in rates would in itself put pressure on the nascent recovery. That should reassure investors in risky assets like stocks and junk bonds.</br></br>Ten-year Treasury yields have risen 0.36 percentage point in a week to 2.38%--in bond-market terms, a big move. That came after healthy U.S. employment growth, the majority of U.S. banks passing a severe "stress test" and the market dialing back expectations for more quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.</br></br>The crucial question is how far yields might rise. That depends in large part on U.S. economic data. Further evidence that the U.S. recovery is gaining traction--in particular corporate spending, further job creation and rising household incomes--is bound to push yields higher. By one measure, they could rise sharply: Ten-year Treasurys were well above 4% the last time the S&P 500 was at its current level in mid-2008. That steep a rise would rival 1994's selloff--when 10-year yields rose to 8% from 5.9%--and could threaten the recovery in housing and the economy.</br></br>But many investors, disappointed by false dawns in recent years, may be slow to unload bonds. The euro zone and Middle East in particular still pose risks to the global economy. Interest rates are at zero, anchoring short-dated yields. Policy makers have expended much effort driving down long-term yields, and may yet seek to contain them. That may mean 10-year Treasury yields are just moving from panic levels to a new range between 2.10% and 2.60% for now. German bunds, meanwhile, look more insulated because of the lingering euro-zone crisis. Even after rising to 2.03%, 10-year bund yields remain well within their recent trading range. So investors could bet bunds outperform Treasurys.
FOR A TIME, there was a reassuring story to tell about the stock market and the economy. Stocks rose in a speculative frenzy, and then fell. But the U.S. economy recovered surprisingly quickly from Sept. 11, aided by the irrepressible American impulse to shop, plus a round of interest-rate cutting. The market was sick. The economy wasn't. Silicon Valley paper millionaires stopped buying Porsches. The rest of us kept buying Chevrolets.</br></br>The magnitude, the speed and the circumstances of the stock-market decline are threatening that comforting story. Unless the market touches bottom soon -- and despite yesterday's spectacular bounce in stock prices, there is no assurance of that -- it is going to yank the economy down with it.</br></br>We may not sink back into recession. But if we have a few more bad weeks on Wall Street, you can rip up those forecasts about the economy growing at a 3.5% annual pace in the second half. Instead, the economy will slow so much that unemployment starts climbing again and the much-delayed resumption of business capital spending will be delayed still further.</br></br>History offers lots of lessons at a time like this. It's just hard to tell which ones to apply. After the 1987 stock-market crash, consumers paused for a bit, but the economy barely faltered. In 1998, the stock market dropped, and two fantastic years followed. Seven of the 14 bear markets since 1929 didn't coincide with recessions. But seven did, and the damage that a bursting bubble did to Japan is a reminder of how badly things can go awry even in a wealthy, modern economy.</br></br>The economic fundamentals in the U.S. are still strong. The White House and Alan Greenspan are right about that; they aren't mindlessly reciting Herbert Hoover's memoirs. The very resilience of the U.S. economy, so far, has been impressive. And technology's productivity-producing benefits haven't evaporated with all those dot-coms.
Stocks in the U.S. fell, but they mostly shook off a global selloff sparked by worries over Federal Reserve action and weak growth in China.</br></br>The Dow edged down 12.67 points, or 0.1%, to 15294.50. The blue chips fell sharply immediately after the opening bell, but they drifted into positive territory for much of the afternoon. Hewlett-Packard led the nine gainers in the 30-stock average, rallying 17% after reporting core profits that beat Wall Street expectations after Wednesday's close.</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 4.84 points, or 0.3%, to 1650.51, and the Nasdaq Composite Index edged 3.88 points lower, or 0.1%, to 3459.42.</br></br>Global stock markets dove Thursday, following a whipsaw Wednesday session in the U.S. sparked by conflicting messages from the Federal Reserve on when it might roll back bond purchases. But U.S. shares were ultimately insulated from the worst of the losses.</br></br>The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% over two days--its first string of declines since April 18--a fall overshadowed by Thursday's 7.3% selloff of Japanese stocks and 2.1% decline in European shares. The S&P has gained 3.3% this month.
President Reagan is proposing an $848;5 billion budget for fiscal 1984 that would barely keep pace with inflation, make deep new domestic spending cuts while increasing military outlays and leave a deficit of $189 billion, congressional leaders were told yesterday -by administration officials. ,</br></br>Under the plan that Reagan will submit to Congress Monday, overall spending in the fiscal year to begin next Oct. 1 would rise by $43.3 billion. Defense would account for roughly $30 billion of that even though the defense request was cut $8 billion earlier this year.</br></br>The anticipated $189 billion deficit for the 1984 fiscal year would follow a deficit of $208 billion now projected for the current fiscal 1983 and a deficit of $110.7 billion for 1982, which was a record-setter at the time.</br></br>The new budget envisions about $43 billion in cuts from the levfels to which spending would rise under current law, including savings from a 6-month delay in cost-of-living increases for Social Security and other federal programs that are tied to inflation, a 12-month freeze of federal pay and retirement benefits and an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½aggregate,ï¿½Û or unevenly applied, freeze of many other domestic programs.</br></br>Some of the largest cuts would be in health programs, mainly Medicare. Medicare recipients would have to pay more of the cost of routine care. There would be a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½workfareï¿½Û requirement for food stamp and welfare recipients, and there would be a freeze on farm price support levels.
VIENTIANE, Laos, April 19 (UPI)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Royal Government of Laos intends to ask other anti-Communist Asian nations for help in the economic crisis brought on by suspension of American financial aid, informed sources said today.</br></br>The report coincided wth a disclosure that Royal Laotian army troops were trying to track down pro-Communist guerillas who struck in a bold surprise attack only seven miles from the Vientiane airport Monday.</br></br>Informed sources said Prince Boun Oum, the Premier, wil leave here next week to plead personally with the governments of Thailand and South Viet-Nam for financial aid. They said the Government wants technical and economic assistance, not military aid.</br></br>come to terms on a coalition government headed by ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½neutralistï¿½Û Prince Souvanna Phou-ha and including the pro-Communist Patthet Lao rebels.</br></br>The war between the Government forces and the rebels appears to have settled into a guerilla pattern of small skirmishes.
NEW YORK -- What a difference a day makes, not to mention a meager quarter of a percentage point.</br></br>That is what bullish gold traders discovered yesterday as they watched the recent gains accrued by the yellow metal wash away in a tide of disappointment. That followed the Federal Open Market Committee's opting to trim interest rates by a conservative quarter of a percentage point instead of the half-point some expected.</br></br>August gold futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange plunged more than $4 before bouncing to end the session at $270 a troy ounce, $2.80 lower than Wednesday.</br></br>To be fair, it wasn't the Fed decision alone that pulled the legs out from under gold prices. Even ahead of the announcement Wednesday afternoon, gold had begun to weaken on a selloff in the oil sector.</br></br>Market watchers are increasingly "looking at energies as leaders for other inflation-geared commodities," according to George Gero, first vice president at Prudential Securities.
WASHINGTON -- Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, warned that U.S. efforts to retaliate against its trading partners could cause a "world-wide recession."</br></br>Mr. Boskin's strong comments, coming in the midst of an administration debate over trade policy, seemed to be aimed at other administration officials as well as at members of Congress and business groups pushing for tough trade action.</br></br>"While there are some unfair trading practices out there and those need to be rooted out," Mr. Boskin said, "they are not the cause of our trade deficit, other than a small part of it. And it is my view that if we wind up with a series of these retaliatory measures with our trade partners . . . it will not only cause a recession in the United States, it will cause a world-wide recession."</br></br>Trade Representative Carla Hills announced on Friday that the U.S. may retaliate against Japan for limiting U.S. access to its telecommunications market. In addition, taking the first step in a new trade process that eventually could lead to retaliatory action against a number of major U.S. trading partners, the trade representative released a review of foreign trade barriers.</br></br>Mr. Boskin has argued within the administration to tone down attacks against foreign trading practices. "I think we are starting to see an immense amount of bashing of our allies and trade partners," he said yesterday. "I think far and away the biggest danger to the economy is the incredible gathering momentum that could well produce a trade war," he said.
DAVENPORT, Iowa -- The lush red strawberries caught the attention of Rachel Patrick, a mother of five shopping at a farmers market along the Mississippi River here. She selected two cartons and ignited a little-noticed chain reaction that is an important part of President Barack Obama's economic stimulus plan.</br></br>Ms. Patrick handed a plastic card loaded with her monthly food-stamp allocation to farmer Ed Kraklio Jr., who swiped it through his electronic reader. Mr. Kraklio now regularly takes in several hundred dollars a month from food-stamp sales, a vital new revenue stream that has allowed him to hire another assistant to help tend a cornucopia of fruits and vegetables. The new worker, in turn, spends her income in nearby stores, restaurants and gas stations.</br></br>The president's stimulus plan has been aimed primarily at the top of the economy, pumping money into banks and car companies and state and city governments. But it also has put more money into the hands of the poorest Americans by boosting monthly food-stamp allocations. Starting in April, a family of four on food stamps received an average of $80 extra.</br></br>Money from the program -- officially known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- percolates quickly through the economy. The U.S. Department of Agriculture calculates that for every $5 of food-stamp spending, there is $9.20 of total economic activity, as grocers and farmers pay their employees and suppliers, who in turn shop and pay their bills.</br></br>While other stimulus money has been slow to circulate, the food-stamp boost is almost immediate, with 80% of the benefits being redeemed within two weeks of receipt and 97% within a month, the USDA says.
WASHINGTON -- July's 0.5% rise in producer prices suggests inflation could increase sharply in coming months, many analysts said.</br></br>Excluding the often volatile food and energy components, the Labor Department said, producer prices jumped by 0.6% in July, double the 0.3% increase in June. This measure hasn't climbed more in a single month since a 0.7% rise in October 1986.</br></br>In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that business inventories in June rose 0.7% while business sales were up a sharp 1.5%. The ratio of inventories to sales fell slightly to 1.50 from 1.51.</br></br>The Labor Department also reported a 0.7% increase in prices of semiprocessed, or intermediate, goods. These materials have risen by 0.6% or more in each of the past four months.</br></br>Some analysts said that the price increases in finished goods indicate the increases in raw material and intermediate goods prices of earlier months had passed on to higher prices in final goods. And the continuing increases in the price of intermediate goods suggests further rises in consumer prices, they said.
Frenzied securities trading tied to the recent, robust stock market, as well as a surge in new-customer accounts, helped online broker E*Trade Group Inc. post a narrower-than-expected loss for its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31.</br></br>And even though analysts expect E*Trade to continue to lose money well into this year, shares of the Palo Alto, Calif., company leapt on the news: In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, E*Trade soared $20.875, or nearly 31%, to $88.50, a new 52-week high. E*Trade, which analysts say is trading like an Internet stock instead of a financial-services company, has seen its shares skyrocket 217% during the last three weeks.</br></br>E*Trade said it had a loss of $13.2 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, compared with profit of $5.1 million, or 12 cents a share, for last year's fiscal first quarter. The Wall Street consensus estimate was for a first-quarter loss of 30 cents a share.</br></br>Core transaction revenues, mainly stock commissions, increased 60% from last year and 40% from the last, sequential quarter as investors clamored for hot Internet stocks and other technology issues. "It's existing customers trading more . . . coupled with new customers coming online faster," E*Trade Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos said.</br></br>But the flurry of trades couldn't make up for the $41 million E*Trade poured into marketing to promote its new Web site, analysts said. E*Trade, which is spending heavily to compete with scores of other low-priced Internet trading houses, could devote a staggering $50 million to $60 million to marketing this quarter, said Bill Burnham, who follows the company for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.
Every weekday at the Erie Neighborhood House on this city's North Side, feisty 4- and 5-year-olds file into classrooms that bear names such as Sunflower and Daffodil to play with Legos and dinosaurs and receive their daily lessons in Spanish and English.</br></br>Their parents, depending on the family income, pay as little as $4.33 a month for the all-day child care that costs as much as $250 a week on the open market, an enormous sum for the many who are recent immigrants working two or three jobs to survive.</br></br>But the sounds of children playing and learning in these classrooms may soon be silenced as part of a belt-tightening proposal by Gov. George Ryan (R) that would do away with a $184 million early childhood grant that subsidizes pre-kindergarten classes for 220,000 low-income children around the state.</br></br>Illinois, like nearly every other state, is facing lean times for the first time in years. Tax revenue is well below expectations, the cost of health care is exploding and higher costs for unemployment claims and new security initiatives are taxing already thin budgets. Everything is on the table -- including tax incentives for businesses, public education money and programs aimed at the poor, disabled and elderly -- as governors and state lawmakers try to make up more than $40 billion worth of budget shortfalls.</br></br>In Maryland, the state Senate yesterday gave preliminary approval to a new austerity budget that would slow spending after years of dramatic increases while preserving a scheduled 2 percent income tax cut. Virginia, with an annual budget of about $25 billion, approved new spending plans last week that cut social programs and other services while increasing fees and college tuitions to close a budget gap estimated at $3.8 billion for the next 2 1/2 years.

For investors seeking strong and steady returns, one commodity stands tall in terms of recent performance: exchange membership seats.</br></br>The price of doing business on most major U.S. futures exchanges has jumped this year, reflecting a 15% rise in futures trading and a 30% rise in options volume compared with the first half of 1986.</br></br>The seat-price surge continues a pattern that began nearly two years ago, when the weakening of the U.S. dollar started to cause some concern about a renewal of inflation. That concern triggered brisk activity on the commodity exchanges, and now many commodity prices, after sluggish activity stemming from a 6 1/2-year bear market, appear to have bottomed out.</br></br>Many investors "are convinced commodity prices have begun to move," John Urbanchuk, an economist for Wharton Econometrics in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says. "People see an opportunity to make money in the markets to a much greater extent" than in recent years, he says.</br></br>Moreover, the consolidation of futures brokerages that had led to a glut of available seats in recent years has abated, industry officials and exchange executives say.
WINCHENDON, Mass. -- Money still grows on trees.</br></br>Timberland, which a few years ago became a popular investment among institutions and wealthy folks, has held up amid market massacres for most other assets lately.</br></br>Through Sept. 30, the value of timberland rose 5%. When the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries reports 2008's final quarter this week, this number is unlikely to move much. That marks a slower pace of growth, yet it is growth nonetheless. In 2007, timber appreciation was a towering 15%.</br></br>How can positive returns exist in these dark days of shrunken prices for everything ranging from real estate to commodities to stocks? Oil, after a summer price spike, was down 54% in 2008, while corn lost 11% and copper 54%. (Gold, as a refuge commodity, rose 6%.) Prices for lumber, a key forest product, have fallen by 34% over the past year as housing construction has ebbed.</br></br>The answer to this riddle is that timberland is the ultimate long-term investment, with relatively little bought and sold each year -- and demand still respectable for what does change hands. "As long as the sun shines, the trees will grow," says Jeremy Grantham, chairman of Boston money manager GMO and a long-time fan of timber investing. "Timber will never be an orphan."
The worst recession since the Great Depression will weigh on the labor market and the broader economy for years to come, economists in a Wall Street Journal forecasting survey said. On average, economists don't expect unemployment to fall below 6% until 2013. Meanwhile, new jobless claims fell last week.</br></br>Shoppers snapped up school supplies and apparel in September, resulting in the first overall rise in retail sales in more than a year.</br></br>The federal government said it had met its goal of beginning trial loan modifications for 500,000 financially troubled homeowners.</br></br>---</br></br>Stocks gained as investors welcomed Alcoa's earnings and retail-sales data. The Dow industrials rose 61.29 points, or 0.6%, to 9786.87.
TOKYO -- Investors unsettled by the yen's weakness and signs of tighter credit in Japan sent share prices plunging Thursday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</br></br>The Nikkei index plummeted 431.69 points to close at 26934.26, its first move beneath the 27000 level since May 28 and its second-biggest drop of the year. The only bigger decline occurred Aug. 10, when the index lost 615.49 points, in reaction to the U.S. Federal Reserve's discount rate boost.</br></br>Share prices were fluctuating early Friday in Tokyo. At the close of the morning session, the Nikkei index was up 70.38 points to 27004.64. Earlier during the morning, the Nikkei was down.</br></br>The Tokyo stock price index of all issues listed in the first section dropped 34.82 points to 2093.20 on Thursday. First section volume was estimated at a modest 480 million shares, compared with 400 million Wednesday.</br></br>The Tokyo market recorded its steepest intraday loss of the year, sinking more than 664 points at midmorning before rebounding somewhat in the afternoon.
Continuing jitters about Europe ensured that Monday was a down day for financial markets. But perhaps the bigger news is that it was not a disastrous day, even as a significant broker-dealer filed for bankruptcy.</br></br>The Chapter 11 filing by MF Global was in part reassuring news that failure is still allowed on Wall Street. With $41 billion in assets, MF is much smaller than Lehman Brothers but still among the largest bankruptcies of the last decade.</br></br>Yesterday also offered a chance for market participants and taxpayers to reflect on their good luck that MF Global Chairman and CEO Jon Corzine was not running a bigger firm -- or the U.S. Treasury. While the collapse of his company was big enough to cause major headaches in the futures market where MF provided clearing services for a long client list, almost nobody considered it too big to fail. Similarly, although MF Global this year became one of the 22 "primary dealers" for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to buy and sell Treasury debt, bond markets shrugged off the bankruptcy filing.</br></br>These facts allow policy makers who are paying attention to glean some relatively painless lessons from the firm's demise. For example: As ever, regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission does not prevent reckless risk-taking and financial trauma.</br></br>In a document related to its bankruptcy filing, MF Global said its regulators "expressed their grave concerns" after a series of negative headlines about the company last week, including news of a large quarterly loss and a credit downgrade.
Unlike his hero, the pensive intellectual St. Thomas More, Mario M. Cuomo may not be a man for all seasons.</br></br>Often at his most contentious during the best of times, the governor is being watched eagerly here to see whether he can remain serene during the dark winter that surely lies ahead for New York.</br></br>The giddy era of expansion and growth that marked much of Cuomo's first two terms has come to a shuddering halt. And as he gravely warned legislators when they convened here last week, New York faces fiscal pain so severe that it "will jar even the most experienced" among them.</br></br>"This is a wonderful year for raw truth," he told them. "We don't have any money." He told a hushed and nervous opening session of the Legislature that 1991 would have a pivotal effect on the state's history. He did not need to add that it surely will have a pivotal effect on his history as well.</br></br>Clearly, this be the most arduous, painful and highly publicized year of Cuomo's eight-year tenure, in part because the 58-year-old Democrat must decide again whether to run for president. The blame for New York's dizzying economic freefall - a widening recession, a budget gap of nearly $4 billion and a credit rating better than that of only two other states - has increasingly been laid at the doorstep of the executive mansion.
WASHINGTON -- After four months of unproductive talks, White House and congressional budget negotiators finally narrowed their differences and say they could reach a deficit-reduction compromise by late today or tomorrow morning.</br></br>"I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not always seemed so smooth," President Bush said in a televised address to Congress last night.</br></br>"But with or without an agreement from the budget summit, I ask both houses of Congress to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500 billion deficit reduction package not later than Sept. 28."</br></br>The Republican and Democratic sides are converging on a compromise that would raise taxes about $130 billion net over the next five years -- including an energy tax of some sort, a new tax on luxury goods and higher taxes on alcoholic beverages.</br></br>Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and $200 billion from projected levels, based on proposals offered by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with both sides now proposing to make the elderly pay a bigger share of the cost of the rapidly growing Medicare program. Savings on interest costs would account for the balance of the $500 billion package. Even if negotiators agree to cut the deficit $50 billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. and the package is enacted, the federal deficit will still approach $200 billion, the White House budget office estimates. As a result, any pact will have to waive the $64 billion deficit target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz told Congress yesterday that the Nationï¿½Ûªs annual loss from unemployment is equivalent to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½shutting the country downï¿½ï¿½ï¿½with no production, no services, no pay ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for over three weeks.ï¿½Û</br></br>Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz told Congress yesterday that the Nationï¿½Ûªs annual loss from unemployment is equivalent to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½shutting the country downï¿½ï¿½ï¿½with no production, no services, no pay ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ for over three weeks.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If that actually happened, we wuld do something about it,ï¿½Û Wirtz said.

Spending this fiscal year is running so much lower than expected .for medical care, deposit insurance losses, interest on the debt and some other programs that budget experts said the 1993 deficit is apt to be $35 billion or so less than the Clinton administration estimated only a few weeks ago.</br></br>A number of Wall Street budget: watchers now expect that the deficit, for all of 1993 will be around $280r billion, about $10 billion lower than 1992's $290 billion and well below the $316 billion administration estimate.</br></br>drops off unexpectedly, the Wall Street projections could be correct. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Right now, if I were a betting person, I would bet on a deficit lower than last year's level."

CORPORATE EARNINGS rose 5% in the third quarter, but the pace of growth was the slowest in more than two years.

The Federal Reserve's quantitative-easing program is unpopular across most emerging markets, but the latest round should prove far less contentious than earlier ones.</br></br>Looking beyond the Fed-bashing rhetoric that has become a habit as much in Brasilia and Beijing as in some corners of Washington, today's global economic fundamentals suggest there will be a different outcome from the U.S. bond-buying program, known as QE3.</br></br>When the Fed launched an earlier bond-buying program in 2010, many of these emerging markets were preoccupied with controlling inflation and felt threatened by Fed efforts to spur growth. With these emerging markets now suffering their own growth ills, Fed stimulus has the potential to help, not hurt.</br></br>That isn't stopping complaints that the Fed's actions will flood the world with too much capital.</br></br>"The rise in global liquidity could lead to rapid capital inflows into emerging markets including South Korea and China and push up global raw-material prices," said Bank of Korea governor Kim Choong-soo last week. "Therefore, Korea and China need to make concerted efforts to minimize the negative spillover effect arising from the monetary policies of advanced nations."
Panic buying hit the bond market yesterday as investors, apparently convinced that interest rates are down to stay, scrambled to purchase bonds before yields fell any further.</br></br>In the process, rates on intermediate- and long-term U.S. Treasury securities were driven down one-tenth to two-tenths of a percentage point in a single day.</br></br>Levy, chief economist at CRT Government Securities Ltd. in New York. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The whole fixed-income market has appreciated dramatically."</br></br>Levy said most financial market participants seem convinced that inflation will stay low and, perversely, that President Clinton's deficit reduction proposals will dampen rather than spur economic growth.</br></br>"Actually, the package does nothing to harm the economy in the short run,ï¿½Û Levy said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It is clear sailing for economic growth."
Stymied by concerns about interest rates and earnings, investors pushed stock prices lower today, focusing again on technology issues.</br></br>The latest blow for the high-tech sector was Merrill Lynch's downgrading of the fiber-optic industry, which had been seen as the last solid performer in the industry.

The other day I visited my local bank and bought $30 each of French francs, German marks and Italian lire. I have no immediate need for them or the Spanish pesetas, Greek drachmas or Dutch guilders that I might also have purchased. I just wanted some historic mementos, because after Jan. 1 the national currencies of 12 European countries with 305 million people are scheduled to disappear in favor of the euro. Although I have long doubted the euro's benefits, the moment is undeniably historic.</br></br>Never before have so many people in so many countries simultaneously adopted a new money. Since 1999 stores and banks have priced in both euros and national currency; now people get the real stuff. The conversion is a massive operation. The European Central Bank (ECB) has minted 52 billion new coins (170 for each person in the "euro area") and printed 14.9 billion bank notes (49 per person). The total value is 649 billion euros, which, at present exchange rates (1 euro equals about 90 cents), is about $584 billion.</br></br>Throughout history, money -- its creation or destruction -- has always been a political act. The euro has been controversial precisely because it engages vast political ambitions. To critics, it represents a step toward "a European super-state that will submerge the individuality of the European nations in an unwieldy federation, hobbled by bureaucracy [that imposes] a crippling burden of regulatory and other costs on Europe's economies," wrote one British commentator. Having reservations, three of the European Union's 15 members -- Britain, Denmark and Sweden -- have so far rejected the euro.</br></br>To its enthusiasts, the euro means economic vitality and political unity. Companies won't have to convert all those different currencies. Easier cross-border price comparisons will compel firms to become more efficient. As cross-border investment rises, money will increasingly go to the most deserving companies. Economic success will strengthen a European consciousness.</br></br>Let's hope so. But I'm skeptical, because I fear that (a) the euro won't create major economic gains and that (b) it will trigger a political backlash. So much economic power is being centralized in Frankfurt and Brussels -- the homes of the ECB and the European Commission -- that local and global economic discontent may focus increasingly on "Europe" as the villain.
Stock prices fell in London and across Europe as the dollar's decline in overseas trading worried investors.</br></br>Concern over the dollar affected early trading Wednesday in Japan. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 selected stocks stood at 23106.07, down 252.53, at the end of Wednesday's morning session. The Japanese market was closed Tuesday for a national holiday; other Asian markets were generally higher.</br></br>In London, share prices were sharply lower at the close Tuesday as participants remained concerned about the dollar's slide and the implications for U.S. interest rates. The U.S. currency bounced back after European markets closed.</br></br>The Financial Times 30-share index closed 56.6 points lower at 1286.1. Volume was 727 million shares, well above the 462.7 million shares a day earlier. The 100-share index was off 69.8 points at 1653.9.</br></br>Dealers said the market remained nervous all day about a further slide in the dollar. Some investors fear a tumbling dollar will prompt U.S. officials to raise interest rates, which in turn could add to recessionary pressure.
Treasury bills fell Tuesday, pushing up yields, as the government announced an unexpected increase in supply to fund a temporary borrowing program.</br></br>The fall in bills contrasted with the gains seen in Treasury securities that mature in more than a year, which benefited from renewed worries about the economic recovery in the U.S. and elsewhere -- concerns that helped attract buyers to the Treasury's sale of $44 billion in two-year notes.</br></br>The Treasury's increase in the size of its Supplementary Financing Program, or SFP, from $5 billion to $200 billion in the next two months, will come as relief to money-market funds, which have been stymied by a lack of supply and short-term yields near zero percent. These funds, which are required to buy financial assets maturing in a year or less, have seen outflows of more than $400 billion over the past year.</br></br>Tuesday's announcement will "help to put some air under short-term rates," said Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist within the fixed-income group at Jefferies & Co. "Short-term rates are so low that it is difficult for investors in short-term instruments, such as the T-bill sector, to make any money."</br></br>The Supplementary Financing Program was initially set up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis and was used to provide funding to the Federal Reserve to support its liquidity programs to rescue banks and the credit markets. Late last year, as the federal government's borrowing approached the debt ceiling, Treasury scaled back the program to $5 billion. Earlier this month, Congress raised the debt ceiling by $1.9 trillion to $14.3 trillion, allowing the program's resumption.
WASHINGTON -- The Senate voted to expand unemployment benefits for workers idled by the recession as House Democrats retreated on a nickel-a-gallon gasoline tax increase for highway and mass-transit improvements.</br></br>The jobless package, expected to cost $5.2 billion in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, fulfills a major pledge by the Democratic leadership. The format of the legislation, however, would give President Bush wide discretion over whether the program is implemented.</br></br>The concessions clear the way for Congress to adjourn for the August recess, and before leaving this weekend, back-to-back appropriations bills are expected to be sent to the White House, raising Senate pay 23% and providing $21.8 billion for federal energy and water programs.</br></br>As rushed through the Senate last night, the unemployment benefits bill would authorize as many as 20 weeks of federal unemployment compensation for workers who have exhausted their initial 26 weeks of state assistance. This compares with the 13 weeks in benefits now provided under current law, with costs shared by the federal and state governments. The measure also would lower the threshold unemployment rate that individual states must meet to qualify for federal benefits.</br></br>According to the Labor Department, 3.4 million workers will exhaust their state and federal benefits in the coming year, and under the current program, workers in only three states in July qualified for the maximum extended benefits. By comparison, under the Democratic proposal, 17 states would have gotten at least 13 weeks in July, including seven that would have enjoyed the additional seven weeks of benefits promised in the bill.
With the Dow Jones industrials on the brink of 10,000, you might think this would be a period of celebration and congratulation. But no. The gloomy financial pundit class is issuing more ultimatums than NATO and heaping scorn on those poor saps who have sextupled their money in America Online Inc.</br></br>The truth is, small investors have been right for the past five years. When stocks fell sharply in October 1997 and again during the summer of 1998, many pros panicked, but the little guys held their ground.</br></br>Still, the theme emerging in the press on the eve of quintuple digits is that dimwitted investors have forgotten the past. "After several years in which stocks do better than their long-term average- -as they have in the 1990s--there is a better-than-even chance that they'll underperform over the subsequent several years," wrote Mark Hulbert last week in the New York Times.</br></br>Hulbert quoted two economics professors, John Campbell of Harvard and Robert Shiller of Yale, as saying that stocks will drop by one- third--or worse.</br></br>But don't panic just yet. Campbell and Shiller have been bearish for a long time. It was Shiller who issued the influential dire warning at a Federal Reserve Board meeting in 1996 just before Chairman Alan Greenspan's "irrational exuberance" speech--with the Dow at 6437.

NEW YORK -- The euro bucked recent trends by gaining against the dollar even as weak euro-zone data and solid U.S. economic data pressured the common currency.</br></br>Traders generally shied away from dollar buying as U.S. stocks continued to sink on more profit warnings and little hope of immediate relief from monetary easing. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony Wednesday quelled talk of an intermeeting interest-rate cut, but still left a fog of uncertainty over the U.S. economic landscape.</br></br>The dollar was little changed against the yen as yen-negative implications of the Bank of Japan's surprise rate cut Wednesday and a 201.88-point drop in the Nikkei 225-stock Index yesterday squared off with yen-supportive continuing repatriation flows.</br></br>"Traders are building [euro] positions because they don't want to miss any abrupt move upwards," said Michael Donahue, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Fimat USA in New York.</br></br>There is "continued concern by overseas holders of U.S. equities," Mr. Donahue said, adding that if stocks couldn't find support soon, the euro could build momentum toward parity with the dollar.
A burst of selling in the final minutes of a volatile day of trading left stocks sharply lower yesterday as investors focused more on the deep strains in the economy than on a glimmer of optimism in a surprise gain in new-home sales.</br></br>Trading was light as investors awaited the beginning of the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting today in which the bank's policymaking committee will consider lowering interest rates again to try to head off a prolonged economic slump. The Fed is expected to cut rates tomorrow by a half-percentage point, to 1 percent.</br></br>Stocks got off to a negative start after a massive sell-off overseas, sending the Dow Jones industrial average down 170 points in early trading. The market reversed course on the housing news and on plans that the Treasury would start distributing much-needed money to nine major banks this week.</br></br>After the swift sell-off near the close, the Dow finished down 203.18 points, or 2.4 percent, to 8175.77, its lowest level in 51/2 years. By the end of trading, the Dow had slid more than 400 points from its high during the day. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 27.85 points, or 3.2 percent, to 848.92, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 46.13 points, or 3 percent, to 1505.90.</br></br>As part of the Treasury's plan for bank infusions, 15 banks added their names to the list.

Author: Jonathan Weisman; Damian Paletta</br></br>WASHINGTON--President Barack Obama's budget proposal is expected to give states a way to collect more payroll taxes from businesses, in an effort to replenish the unemployment-insurance program. The plan could cause controversy at a time when the administration is seeking to mend fences with corporate America.</br></br>The proposal would aim to restock strained state unemployment-insurance trust funds by raising the amount of wages on which companies must pay unemployment taxes to $15,000, more than double the $7,000 in place since 1983.</br></br>The plan, which would take effect in 2014, could increase payroll taxes by as much as $100 billion over a decade, according to a person involved in its construction.</br></br>By proposing to enlarge the pool of wages subject to unemployment taxes, the White House appears to be offering states a more politically palatable way to raise revenues than to boost tax rates. States could keep the tax rates they have, or even lower them somewhat, and still raise considerably more revenue than they are raising now.
GENERATIONS OF VISITORS to Disneyland have been thrilled by Circle-Vision, an immense circular theater with a 360-degree screen that surrounds the audience with you-are-there movies. Those who can't make the trip to the theme park might want to check out BeHere Inc., a Silicon Valley startup that has what might be the next-best thing.</br></br>BeHere sells a camera lens and software system that allows most sorts of cameras to take live 360-degree pictures. The company says these images can be put to any number of uses: on the Web, in building security systems, and in a new generation of interactive television to allow viewers to be immersed, for example, in a sporting event.</br></br>The five-year-old company was founded in Cupertino, Calif., by Ted Driscoll, 48 years old, a Stanford University computer science Ph.D., entrepreneur and inveterate tinkerer who developed its core technology. Last year, Andrew L. Thau, 35, a former senior vice president at Fox Sports International, came on board as chief executive. Mr. Thau set about boosting the company's ties to the broadcasting industry; he opened an office in Los Angeles, though the company will keep its research-and-development operation in Silicon Valley.</br></br>The idea of giving Web surfers and others a 360-degree view of something isn't new. Numerous sites afford a circle-style view of, say, the inside of a house that is for sale. A number of companies, such as Internet Pictures Corp. and RemoteReality Corp., are supplying the necessary technology to make that happen, though some of the companies currently sell only still cameras.</br></br>Mr. Thau says BeHere's system allows a camera to take a moving, rather than still, 360-degree picture that has a seamless image. There are no fissure marks where separate pieces of the circular scene are pieced together to form a whole. "What excited me about the company was that the technology was unique," Mr. Thau said. "I spent seven years at Fox Sports, and if I was still there, this is something I would be willing to use and pay money for."

WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is taking a harder line on the perils of rapid growth, signaling that the Fed will keep raising interest rates unless consumer spending and the stock market quickly cool down.</br></br>In his semiannual economic presentation to Congress, Mr. Greenspan dropped his assertion -- made a month ago -- that the Fed's attempts to rein in the economy with earlier interest-rate increases were "well advanced."</br></br>Instead, he said yesterday that investor optimism and a bullish stock market have "to date . . . more than offset" the effects of higher rates and that spending even in sectors of the economy normally considered sensitive to higher rates "has remained robust." There is, he said, "little evidence that the American economy . . . is slowing appreciably."</br></br>In a booklet presented to the House Banking Committee accompanying Mr. Greenspan's testimony, Fed staffers wrote that the continued surge in demand "implies that the level of interest rates needed to align demand with potential supply may have increased substantially."</br></br>Markets have long been expecting the Fed to boost its target for the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- by at least a quarter of a percentage point when policymakers next meet on March 21. Many investors have been expecting at least another half-point increase by the summer.
NEW YORK -- Short-selling, among the riskiest of all stock market strategies, is starting to win converts among the most conservative of all investors -- pension funds.</br></br>Unlike ordinary investors, short-sellers make money when a stock goes down, not up. They do this by borrowing shares from a broker and selling them -- betting that the stock will fall in value and that they can replace the borrowed shares later at a lower price.</br></br>Because short-sellers thrive on corporate disasters and financial foul-ups, they are often reviled by companies whose shares they short and are accused of spreading lies to send stocks plunging. "There's this feeling that it's un-American, and that you shouldn't be dumping on other people," says short-seller Russ Faucett of Los Angeles-based Barrington Partners.</br></br>Some pension funds and other institutional investors have expanded their use of sophisticated short-sale techniques to hedge against price drops hurting their stock holdings. But most funds have shunned short-selling as a money-making strategy in its own right.</br></br>Now that's changing. "We're seeing more institutional money on the short side of the market, and much more is interested in pursuing" the strategy, says Michael Minikes, managing director of Bear, Stearns & Co., which lends stock to short-sellers and handles many short-sale trades. Institutional short-selling activity is tiny so far, but this "is just the beginning," he says.
NEW YORK, Dec. 23 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Early leadership from a handful of blue chips failed to inspire a dull stock market today and the list went through another irregular decline. Trading was moderate.</br></br>The same pattern as yesterdayï¿½Ûªs prevailed except that the loss at the end was considerably-greater, although not really sharp compared with past records.</br></br>Several high-quality issues among the chemicals, mail orders and oils responded again to investment demand as the list moved irregularly in the morning. Later in the day losses widened in the over-all list and the market was definitely lower.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average declined 2.34 to 868.02 after showing a gain of 1.10 at the end of the first half hour.</br></br>The powerful weight of du Pont was thrown behind the early rise when stock of the big chemical was up as much as 4 points. Du Pont erased that gain, however, and closed with a net loss of l7/ï¿½ï¿½.
In the slow economic recovery, even banks that grow receive scrutiny. Of the four large regional banks that reported earnings on Wednesday, results were muddled by recent acquisitions at two banks and the other two reported clear progress in profitability and robust loan growth. Investor reaction was mixed.</br></br>Comerica Inc. and M&T Bank Corp. reported fewer new loans than expected and higher costs amid acquisitions, sending shares of the banks near their 52-week lows.</br></br>In contrast, their larger rivals--U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc.--reported strong demand from commercial borrowers and managed to keep their profit margin in the lending business from deteriorating amid low interest rates. Their shares were flat to lower, but still a way off their 52-week lows.</br></br>Banks improved capital and reported fewer losses from bad loans in recent quarters, factors that lifted bank stocks. But now that loan demand has picked up and the economy is slowly improving, investors have come to expect more.</br></br>The four lenders reporting quarterly results Wednesday have survived the financial crisis better than others and offered some signs of growth.

THE BUDGET deficit is still much too large, and in theory this is the perfect time to reduce it further, while the economy is strengthening and before it overheats. But the president and the Democratic Congress have given themselves time off this year from conventional deficit reduction in favor of health care reform. That adds to the urgency of producing a reform that (a) is affordable - no frills - (b) is solidly financed and (c) includes a credible means of containing costs. If they fail to produce such a plan, they will face a serious fiscal problem next year as well as an unsolved health care problem.</br></br>The economy was in a more uncertain state than now when the president decided last winter to take the year off in terms of deficit reduction. The uncertainty provided a rationale: The need to take care - having already cut the deficit substantially the year before - not to take a second step in the same direction that might choke off the recovery. The president and many congressional Democrats wanted the year off anyway. They have a lot else on their agenda than simply reducing the deficit, which is no one's idea of fun.</br></br>But the decision to shift from the deficit to health care this year was not a dodge or gimmick. It was, and still is, defensible in fiscal as well as programmatic terms. Health care costs are the rogue item in the federal budget, just as they are in every other budget in the country. If left to themselves they will drive up future deficits almost no matter what else Congress does. They have to be contained, nor does it do much good if Congress, in containing them, merely shifts them to the states or private payers. That's a hidden tax increase if ever there was one.</br></br>Almost all the reform plans now in play would increase national (not just federal) spending on health care in the short run by increasing the number of people who are insured. In the longer run, however, a plan that is any good will appreciably reduce projected spending and the pressure on the budget.</br></br>That should be the goal. It was the stated goal when the president introduced his plan. If he and Congress prove incapable of achieving it, here is what they will likely face next year.

Anyone who questions whether we are living in a global economy needs to reflect carefully on the financial turmoil of the past few weeks. We can no longer escape the issue of how to manage in a world in which economic currents have no frontiers but our instruments to deal with them do.</br></br>The International Monetary Fund lies at the center of this storm. It is the only financial institution that has some semblance of global influence. The IMF, however, is the subject of considerable controversy. The traditional approach of the IMF is to lay the foundation for healthy economic growth by restraining government intervention in the economies, ensuring sound currencies and encouraging open markets. Its policies have been a major factor in spurring unprecedented changes in the global economy.</br></br>Current efforts to stabilize the Asian economies, however, are far different and more complex. Gone is the luxury of an exuberant economic environment. Commodity prices are plummeting. Interest rates in the affected countries are soaring, crippling banks and bankrupting business. Manufacturing plants throughout Asia have idle excess capacity. Unemployment is rising sharply. Devaluations and the fall of capital markets have drained substantial liquidity from global markets. The losses on the U.S. stock market alone since July are equivalent to the total annual GDP of all of the Latin American nations combined. Governments cannot balance budgets in the face of collapsing tax receipts, impeding their capacity to stimulate their economies.</br></br>The problem for the IMF, however, is that the issue of corruption that got us into this predicament is just as real. As we see in Russia and many countries of Asia, this is the most pernicious contagion that has infected many banks and commercial enterprises. The result has been illicit enrichment and misallocation of resources, which taxpayers the world over are now being asked to pay. This will not do.</br></br>The deep concerns about corruption reflected in the debate in Congress about IMF funding have to be addressed in formulating new policies. On the positive side, strong U.S. and European economies still exert considerable pull to lift the faltering economies of the developing world. The countries of Asia are now yielding large current-account surpluses, which could help them restore their economies if they have access to bridge capital. The issue is how to restore global confidence while not abetting corrupt practices or rewarding ill-considered lending.
The Brazilian real weakened against the dollar Thursday in early trade as the dollar firmed globally.</br></br>The real was trading at 2.2399 real to the dollar at 8:43 a.m. EDT, compared with 2.2285 at Wednesday's close, according to Tullett Prebon via Factset.</br></br>But the drop could be short lived, after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's Wednesday remarks indicated U.S. monetary policy won't change abruptly.</br></br>"Foreign capital flows (into Brazil) will continue," said Paulo Nepomuceno, a fixed-income strategist at Sao Paulo brokerage firm Coinvalores. "Today's real weakness shouldn't go on for long," he said.</br></br>Mr. Nepomuceno also said there are expectations that Brazilian corporations will make sizable bond issues in the next few days, helping to sustain the currency.
DuPont, the biggest U.S. chemical company, said it expects to announce a pharmaceutical alliance this year and plans to issue stock to track the performance of its life-sciences businesses. DuPont, still a relatively small player in drugs, said it's in discussions with unspecified companies to help bulk up its pharmaceuticals business and help the company reach "critical mass" in the industry. The creation of two classes of common shares will allow investors to separate DuPont's life sciences, which are considered to be growing faster than its traditional chemical business.</br></br>Journalists should shun the role of "Chicken Little" in reporting year 2000 computer problems and avoid undermining Americans' confidence in the banking system, a senior regulator said. "If glitches occur or problems loom, report fully on them, of course, but make sure to place the problem in an appropriate context," Federal Reserve Board member Edward W. Kelley Jr. said during a panel discussion at the Freedom Forum Media Studies Center. "Balance and perspective are key." Kelley said the Federal Reserve was conducting "extensive advance planning" to ensure that banks and savings institutions have cash on hand to meet any surge in demand late in the year from Americans nervous about losing access to their money if computers misread the year "00."</br></br>The Senate Commerce Committee approved a bill that would restore network TV signals to about 750,000 satellite-dish customers who lost the signals two weeks ago because of a court order. The measure, introduced by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), would place a moratorium on cuts until the end of the year, aiding more than 2 million dish owners who have lost signals or are scheduled to lose them. The broadcast industry opposes the bill.</br></br>General Motors agreed to buy more than $1 billion in recycled aluminum over 13 years from Imco Recycling, to lock in supplies for lighter cars that meet new pollution standards. Imco, based in Irving, Tex., the world's largest recycler of aluminum and zinc, will build a $22 million plant in Zilwaukee, Mich., as part of the deal. As automakers strive to use more aluminum in place of steel, still the dominant metal in the industry, they are seeking supply and price guarantees.</br></br>The Today Sponge, the most popular over-the-counter contraceptive for women before it was pulled off the market in 1995, is headed back to U.S. drugstores. A newly founded New Jersey company, Allendale Pharmaceuticals, said it has bought the sponge from its previous manufacturer and hopes to begin selling it again by fall. The Food and Drug Administration said there was never any problem with the product's safety. Instead, then-manufacturer Whitehall- Robins Healthcare decided it would cost too much to upgrade the old manufacturing plant where it made the sponge to meet stringent government safety rules.
In the nearly 16 years that I've been writing this column, I've never seen a better market in which to be a first-time home buyer.</br></br>The rising tide of foreclosures has pushed down home prices significantly over the past 18 months. Homes, relative to income, are about at the historic norm, which means they're more affordable than they've been in at least a decade.</br></br>Beyond that, if you buy a foreclosed property, you might wind up spending even less, as lenders struggle to process all of the foreclosures and short sales that are piling up. (If there were no more foreclosures in Florida, it would take the courts nearly two years to process all of the foreclosures on the docket today.)</br></br>Not only have homes come down in price significantly, but 30-year fixed-rate loans are at about 5 percent. Some first-time buyers are getting 15-year rates at 4.5 percent or lower. These are historically low interest rates that will seem downright cheap if rates rise above 7 percent, which they will probably do several years from now.</br></br>Spending less to finance a property means you can get more for your money or save more for retirement or other purposes. With interest rates so low and home prices falling, homeownership becomes affordable to many first-time home buyers.
The rail industry is lobbying furiously to scrap a little-noted paragraph in both Democratic and Republican budget proposals that would cost railroads and their employees at least $400 million over the next five years.</br></br>Almost lost in the politics of the budget negotiations is the proposal, which would substantially boost the taxes paid to fund retirement benefits for rail workers. The Bush administration has proposed the higher payments to help reduce what it estimates to be a $34 billion unfunded liability.</br></br>Supporters of the budget proposal want the rail industry to step up rail retirement contributions to reduce the risk that the federal government would eventually have to bail out the fund. But railroads say the higher taxes aren't needed because the retirement fund is financially healthy.</br></br>The "fund doesn't need the money," said Richard Briggs, executive vice president of the Association of American Railroads, a trade group. But budget negotiators are "trying to raise the tax as a gimmick to reduce the deficit."</br></br>Drew Lewis, former Transportation secretary who is chairman of Union Pacific Corp., has fired off letters to a half dozen congressional and administration budget negotiators calling the tax unfair and unnecessary. Mr. Lewis was co-chairman of a blue-ribbon commission created by Congress in 1988 to find ways to cut the federal budget deficit. Smaller railroads say they would be hit particularly hard. David Hughes, president of Bangor & Aroostook Railroad in Bangor, Maine, said he would have to cut capital spending 10% to pay the higher taxes.
The new bullishness for the U.S. dollar that began to jell late last week firmed yesterday as the dollar gained against most other major currencies.</br></br>Traders attributed the increased purchases of dollars to higher U.S. interest rates -- the result of a bond market slump -- and raised expectations for economic growth in the U.S.</br></br>However, traders called the dollar's rise a temporary move in a prolonged decline. "I hesitate to say that we're seeing a turnaround," said Leslie A. Puth, a trader at Credit Suisse, New York. "But it is the first time in a couple of months that we've seen any sustained buying of dollars; that is, over two days," she said.</br></br>By late New York trading, the dollar had risen 1.2% against the West German mark, the bellwether European unit, to 2.0745 marks from 2.0508 Friday. The dollar also rose to 155.96 Japanese yen from 155.70.</br></br>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 156.35 yen from 155.96 in New York yesterday afternoon.
The ghost of David Stockman still haunts us. It was Mr. Stockman, Ronald Reagan's budget chief, who proclaimed 27 years ago: "I'm just not going to spend a lot of political capital solving some other guy's problem in 2010." That other guy -- or gal -- will be the next president of the United States.</br></br>To be sure, in many ways the federal budget is in better shape today than it was in Mr. Stockman's day. As a share of the economy, federal outlays and receipts were smaller last year than in fiscal year 1982. Because outlays fell more than receipts, the federal budget deficit amounted to only 1.2% of GDP last year, down from 4% in 1982. In fact, if the economy grows as projected and Congress maintains current tax laws and spending policies, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects a federal budget surplus by 2012.</br></br>That's the good news. Nevertheless, our next president will encounter three ticking tax bombs in the weeks following the inauguration, as he or she prepares the budget for fiscal year 2010. Should even one of them detonate, we all will suffer the consequences.</br></br>The first ticking bomb is the fate of the Bush tax cuts. CBO's optimistic federal budget surplus projection is based on the assumption that Congress will allow the president's tax cuts to expire as scheduled at the end of 2010. That would trigger the largest tax increase in history (nearly $1.9 trillion over seven years), raising taxes on 115 million taxpayers, and returning to the tax rolls 7.8 million low- and middle-income families who now pay no federal income tax because of the Bush tax cuts.</br></br>If this bomb explodes, one thing is certain: It will damage the economy. The Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation estimates the tax hike would, in the short run, oblige the economy to "flirt with recession" or worse.
Richard Parsons says the $13 billion penalty extracted from J.P. Morgan will make big banks reluctant in future crises to help government by absorbing smaller failures ("Sending a Bad Message to Big Banks," op-ed, Oct. 21). But isn't Dodd-Frank meant to keep a financial meltdown from ever happening again?</br></br>That's not the lesson to me. It's that socializing present small failures assures a larger future failure. Mr. Parsons notes that 30 of the top 50 banks in the 1980s banking crisis are now amalgamated into Bank of America, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo, and only one of these three giants might have survived 2008 if failure hadn't been further socialized by the Federal Reserve.</br></br>Results? The U.S. is now $90 trillion in debt for current and future obligations. From the point when government intervened in the S&L crisis, we've not since had sustainable "normalized" interest rates. Despite economic expansion under Presidents Reagan and Clinton, interest rates have been on the same downward trajectory. There is no lasting risk-free rate of return anymore.</br></br>Officials at the Fed lament that in the 1980s the Fed could lower interest rates to spur economic activity, but today with rates near zero, they must use "extraordinary measures." That's incorrect. By forcibly intervening in market failures, government has driven risk steadily higher and interest rates (and purchasing power) correspondingly lower. These aren't the seeds of growth but of its destruction.</br></br>Now we've socialized failures spanning 50 years into the maw of the currency of the U.S. and onto the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve. Where now do we send our socialized failures? To some other planet? Our "great economic thinkers" have done the exact, wrong thing.
JERUSALEM -- Israeli troops tore down part of a synagogue at a West Bank settlement outpost on Tuesday but made no attempt to move adjacent trailer homes, prompting accusations the government is not serious about meeting U.S. demands to dismantle dozens of the outlawed sites.</br></br>Meanwhile, Israeli army bulldozers smashed 25 houses and flattened a mosque in a Palestinian refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, leaving 400 people homeless, local officials said.</br></br>The military said it targeted buildings from which shots were fired at Israeli forces, but did not know how many structures were demolished.</br></br>BOMBAY -- Starving North Koreans have been publicly executed for stealing food and others have died of malnutrition in labor camps, Amnesty International said in a report.</br></br>The human rights group urged the North Korean government to "ensure that food shortages are not used as a tool to persecute perceived political opponents."
Suppose your federal government dramatically slashed tax rates for the well-to-do, all in the name of promoting economic growth. Suppose, too, that it is running a budget deficit and plans to do so for at least the next several years.</br></br>You might assume that you live in a country governed by a bunch of reckless right-wingers, willing to risk the nation's economic health for the benefit of a tiny fat-cat constituency. In fact, you reside in socialist Western Europe.</br></br>Though most of Europe's countries are ruled by left-of-center governments, taxes are coming down across the Continent. Not only are tax-loving countries like the Netherlands and Sweden cutting rates, but so are economic heavyweights like France (yes, France) and Germany.</br></br>Meanwhile, the only major industrial country that is running a large budget surplus, but where apparently respectable people still claim that it can't afford a major tax cut, is the U.S. Viewed from a European perspective, America's epic tax debate is strange indeed.</br></br>Of course, Europe's tax cuts aren't nearly as big as they might be, and opposition parties have vowed to push through bigger relief if they regain power. Yet measured by the standards of American liberals, countries like Germany are about to enjoy "irresponsible" tax relief. Indeed, the tax cut that Berlin started to phase in at the beginning of this year is bigger than President George W. Bush's controversial $1.6 trillion plan.
The nationï¿½Ûªs broadest measure of labor compensation rose only 2.9 percent in the 12 months ending last month, the Labor Department reported yesterday. It was the smallest gain ever recorded, a signal that inflation will likely remain low this year.</br></br>The employment cost index, which shows changes in what employers pay for wages, salaries and benefits, had risen 3 percent in the 12 months that ended in December and 3.2 percent for the year that ended in March 1994.</br></br>Some Clinton administration and Federal Reserve policymakers have expressed concern that the unemployment rate, which was 5.5 percent last month, has reached a level ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The subdued performance of the employment cost index suggests little upward pressure on inflation in 1995.ï¿½Û</br></br>that lias historically caused wages to begin rising more rapidly, adding to inflation pressures. So far, there is no sign of that happening. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Labor costs tend to lead inflation," said Bruce Steinberg, macroeconomics manager for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The subdued performance of the employment cost index suggests little upward pressure on inflation in 1995."</br></br>With many other recent economic indicators pointing to slower economic growth, and now evidence that wages are not taking off, the Fed is not.likely to raise short-term interest rates again this year and could begin to lower them, several analysts said.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Small stocks didn't stray very far from the flat line and ended mixed as investors were cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest-rate meeting today.</br></br>Still, energy stocks rallied after large-cap Exxon Mobil reported a surge in fourth-quarter profit. Atwood Oceanics, which posted a 72% rise in first-quarter net income, rose $2.55, or 2.6%, to $100.68 on the New York Stock Exchange. Contango Oil & Gas jumped 38 cents, or 2.9%, to 13.45 on the American Stock Exchange, and Global Industries added 41 cents, or 3%, to 13.91.</br></br>Several medical-equipment stocks declined after large-cap Kinetic Concept's fourth-quarter revenue missed Wall Street's expectations. Datascope lost 55 cents, or 1.6%, to 34.86, and ArthroCare declined 50 cents, or 1.1%, to 44.50.</br></br>The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks fell 1.35, or 0.18%, to 730.87. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index rose 0.65, or 0.17%, to 378.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index of large and small-cap stocks gained 2.55, or 0.11%, to 2206.78.
Yahoo Inc. said third-quarter profit more than tripled and revenue more than doubled, helped by continued growth in search-related advertising and the effect of acquisitions, and raised its financial forecast for the fourth quarter.</br></br>The Sunnyvale, Calif., Internet company said net income rose to $253 million, or 17 cents a share, from $65 million, or five cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $907 million from $357 million, in part because of acquisitions.</br></br>More than half of Yahoo's net income came from the sale of a portion of its stake in rival Google Inc., following Google's August initial public offering. Yahoo said the sale of Google shares and related tax benefits boosted the bottom line by $129 million. Without the gain, Yahoo's per-share earnings would have been in line with the nine cents expected by analysts polled by Thomson First Call.</br></br>The results exceeded Yahoo's own forecast. Excluding commissions paid to marketing partners, Yahoo reported revenue of $655 million. The company had projected revenue on that basis of $610 million to $650 million.</br></br>Yahoo's results demonstrate continued growth in Internet-related commerce, even as more established technology companies struggled with a summer slowdown. They likely augur similarly strong results when Google reports for the first time as a public company next week.
Recession talk has cast a pall on the computer industry, but some desktop-computer makers are still shining.</br></br>Analysts say results for the December quarter will illustrate a continued split of the industry, in which many makers of mainframes and minicomputers post smaller gains while makers of personal computers and workstations prosper.</br></br>Digital Equipment Corp., based in Maynard, Mass. -- once a highflier that used its minicomputers to tweak the noses of oldline makers of more expensive mainframes -- is getting some nose-tweaking of its own by the likes of Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun Microsystems Inc. with less expensive, fast workstations. Thus analysts say DEC profit will drop as much as 60% in its fiscal second quarter ending Monday.</br></br>A big part of the problem for DEC and other companies such as Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp., which analysts expect to post a fourth-quarter net loss, is the rapidly growing trend toward open systems -- computers that use standard software such as programs written for Unix operating systems. That hurts makers of proprietary systems -- those that run software written only for them.</br></br>But it's a boon for Sun and large PC makers such as Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp., which, despite recession signs, continue to post strong gains. Analyst Bruce Lupatkin of Hambrecht & Quist Inc. expects Compaq to post a 70% rise in fourth-quarter earnings to $133 million, or $1.55 a share, from the year-earlier $79 million, or 92 cents a share, on a 40% revenue gain to $1.1 billion from $788 million.
When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</br></br>There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.</br></br>As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.</br></br>The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.</br></br>Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.
The stock market has been on a rocket ride the last seven months, gaining some 22%. But is there enough fuel to keep flying this high?</br></br>Judging by the $5.9 billion that has flowed into equity mutual funds so far this month, there's still plenty of oomph left. And that doesn't include a vast pool of money waiting in what amounts to an untapped storage tank.</br></br>Robert Adler of AMG Data Service, which provided the mutual-fund figures, says it is the largest amount of cash to come into the funds since early January, when investors put in $7 billion. The evidence suggests that interest in investing is widespread, adds Mr. Adler. He points out that of the 10 largest inflows to individual funds, six were into Fidelity funds, which have a large retail component.</br></br>Money is also coming into the market through increased investments by pension funds, through company stock buybacks and individual stock buying.</br></br>Pension-fund figures supplied by Employee Benefit Research Institute also show that more money has gone into stocks in the first quarter this year than in the same period last year. EBRI says $31 billion has gone into stocks in defined-benefit packages, or almost 7% more than last year, and $46 billion, or almost 10% more, in defined-contribution plans.
HEADLINES shout the fact that the dollar has dropped in value compared to the German mark, the Japanese yen, the Swiss francï¿½ï¿½ï¿½even, lately, the British pound. With a tone of despair, New York hanker Robert V. Roosa, sometimes mentioned as a possible successor to Arthur F. Burns at the Federal Reserve, makes a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ sarcastic reference to the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½sinking dollarï¿½Û and what he terms the "benign neglect" policy of the U.S. government.</br></br>Roosa wants the United States, West Germany, and Japan to intervene in foreign exchange markets to support agreed-upon rates for the Big Three nationsï¿½Ûª currencies. Burns himself, in his best stentorian tones, warns a congressional committee that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we dare not be complacent about the current depreciating tendencies of the dollar.ï¿½Û</br></br>Burnsï¿½Ûª concerns now are echoed routinely by Treasury Secretary W. Michael Blumenthal, who in every speech and congressional appearance swears on a stack of Bibles that he is not trying to depress the dollar to get a competitive advantage for U.S. exports. Eearlier this year, Blumenthal incurred the wrath of the German and Japanese governmentsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and of Burnsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½</br></br>In an interview with this reporter on July 21, Blumenthal said, "I would be quite happy to live with whatever the result (of exchange rate fluctuation) is.ï¿½Û</br></br>To our competitors in West Germany and Japan, that sounded as if Blumenthal was talking the dollar down in an effort to reduce the massive U.S. trade deficit, now estimated at $30 billion. Even with offsetting surpluses on services, the net current account deficit will be about $18 billion this year.
IRS agents are devoting more time to corporate audits that fail to find additional tax dollars, an analysis of federal records released yesterday shows.</br></br>As a result, an increasing share of underreported taxes identified by the government comes from individuals, according to the analysis by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a nonpartisan research group at Syracuse University.</br></br>TRAC said the results raise concerns that the IRS isn't using its limited resources to collect taxes in the fairest and most efficient manner. The analysis comes as Congress and the president grapple with how to close the $350 billion tax gap -- the government's estimate of unreported or uncollected federal taxes -- in the face of rising expenses, particularly from the war in Iraq.</br></br>"You would not expect what we found if the system were running well," said Susan B. Long, a TRAC researcher who is a professor of statistics at Syracuse's business school.</br></br>IRS spokesman Terry Lemons said TRAC's numbers are accurate but that the drop in productivity is the temporary result of a policy change in 2003, when Mark W. Everson became IRS commissioner. The new policy, intended to improve tax collection, shifted auditing time from larger companies to smaller firms and required agents to finish corporate audits more quickly, in part by asking fewer questions.
For two charmed years, California Gov. Gray Davis has been riding the political equivalent of a perfect wave: a resounding vote into office, huge budget surpluses, a friendly legislature, rivals in disarray and glowing public reviews.</br></br>Now, just as he is emerging as one of the nation's most prominent Democratic leaders, Davis is caught in a political riptide jeopardizing his career.</br></br>The lights in the nation's richest and most populous state are barely on. Its biggest utility companies are broke and buried in debt. The Internet giants of Silicon Valley are nervous. Consumer groups are livid. Even Democratic lawmakers are questioning some of the governor's moves. And President Bush, whose campaign flopped here last fall, has no plans to come to the state's rescue.</br></br>There is no easy escape from California's energy meltdown and little time to resolve the crisis before it gets worse.</br></br>Desperate to end almost daily brushes with blackouts and silence his skeptics, Davis just patched together a $10 billion plan to keep power flowing into the state. Next, he has to find a way to keep utilities that have more than 25 million customers solvent.
Beijing -- A CREDIT SQUEEZE gripping one of China's biggest investment companies is spooking investors and raising questions about the way business is being done in the country's stock markets. But there may be some buying opportunities for the brave-hearted.</br></br>D'Long International Strategic Investment, founded in 1986 by four siblings named Tang from China's northwestern region of Xinjiang, rode years of easy credit to become one of the country's largest private conglomerates. Its holdings include one of the world's biggest tomato- paste makers, China's foremost heavy-truck manufacturer, and U.S. lawn-equipment company Murray. D'Long has stakes in more than 100 Chinese companies, including a dozen securities firms and commercial banks.</br></br>This spring, Beijing's credit-tightening measures -- aimed at cooling a hot economy -- coupled with Chinese media reports questioning D'Long's financial health sent share prices of some of the company's listed affiliates spiraling. The developments set off a chain reaction that threatened to bring down the Tangs' empire and damped already-weak investor confidence in China's stock market. It also shined a spotlight on questionable practices that are seen as widespread in China's financial industry, from stock-price manipulation to the use of price-inflated shares as collateral for bank loans.</br></br>D'Long's predicament "tells us that there still exist big loopholes in China's equity-market structure and corporate governance," says Zhang Yong, an analyst for Great Wall Securities.</br></br>Chinese prosecutors haven't charged D'Long with any wrongdoing, and there isn't any indication that the siblings have broken any laws. Some banks and other creditors have filed lawsuits against D'Long, however, and a Shanghai judge involved says the situation "is under further investigation." Some Chinese media have suggested that D'Long ramped up stock prices and then tapped its financial institutions for funding to finance its ambitious expansion -- allegations that company executives have denied.
Mayor Marion Barry said yesterday that he no longer accepts responsibility for making major spending cuts in this year's budget and urged the D.C. financial control board to hurry up and decide how it wants to reduce the city's mounting budget deficit.</br></br>"I've done my share," Barry said in an interview with Washington Post reporters and editors, igniting a harsh reaction from control board officials. "I've done my part. It is now up to the control board. If they tell everybody what to cut, I'll tell everybody what the consequences are."</br></br>Barry's comments came on a day when the city released an audit that documents continued overspending on schools and other city services; apparent violations of procurement and other laws; and problems with government operations, such as computers housed in condemned buildings. The mayor also missed yesterday's deadline to deliver a multi-year financial plan that he said would spell out his vision for transforming city government. Together, the events overshadowed Barry's announcement that he had lowered municipal spending during his first year in office.</br></br>Control board members were angry over Barry's refusal to go beyond his current proposed cuts, which members have described as inadequate. Stephen D. Harlan, the board's vice chairman, called Barry's approach "outrageous" and threatened to slash the mayor's pay and personal budget.</br></br>"It is outrageous that the mayor would abdicate his responsibilities and not provide leadership," Harlan said. "He has become irrelevant, and if he is going to turn over the keys to the city to the control board . . . I think the citizens of this city should know that.
The nationï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate held at 9 Vi percent in August, as the number of people looking for work increased by more than the number of new jobs, the government reported yesterday.</br></br>Despite the levelling off in the unemployment rate, the new figures showed that the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½labor market continued to improve in August,ï¿½Û according to Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood. Almost 300,000 jobs were created last month, and factory overtime increased, she said.</br></br>The rise in jobs did not show up in an improvement in the unemployment rate, because it was more than matched by an increase in the number of people looking for work, the Labor report said. The civilian labor force climbed by 404,000 in August after a slight decline in July. Adult</br></br>Black unemployment, meanwhile, jumped from 19 Vz percent in July to 20 percent in August, as the number of black teenage boys looking for Work soared to a record 56.8 percent, the Labor Department said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We find there is a large disparity ... between the whites and blacks,ï¿½Û said Norwood. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think the problem of jobs for our black teenagers is a serious one.ï¿½Û</br></br>Several analysts had expected unemployment to hold steady or decline only slightly in August after rapid declines in the early months of the recovery. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The general trend is downward, but slowly downward. Youï¿½Ûªve got a combination of growth in the labor force and slower growth in the economy,ï¿½Û said Nariman Beh-ravesh of Wharton Econometrics in Philadelphia.
The battle for Elpida Memory is shaping up as a test case for how Japan treats troubled companies. The failed chip maker's restructuring could have broad implications for the country's other debt-laden firms.</br></br>Elpida sought court protection in February after falling DRAM chip prices and the strong yen left it unable to pay its hefty debts. The company agreed in July to be taken over by Micron Technology of the U.S. for $760 million and the promise of $1.8 billion later out of Elpida's cash flow. This could mean banks and other secured creditors would receive 70% of what they are owed, while unsecured creditors like bondholders would get just 20%-30%.</br></br>Some bondholders are livid, saying the Micron offer is too low, "vague and confusing." They value the company at $3.8 billion and have filed a rival plan with the Tokyo court that would see a yet-unnamed sponsor take over.</br></br>The battle probably wouldn't have happened in Japan's recent past. Previously, investors mostly rolled over while a restructuring was forced upon them. Often, the government would force a shotgun takeover of a collapsed firm by one if its peers. The failed company would be a drag on the rescuer, bad loans would fester, employees would remain in make-work jobs, and the resulting bloated company would weigh on the broader economy.</br></br>But Japan Inc. probably isn't in the bailout business anymore. The government no longer seems to have the stomach for forced mergers, and with public debt more than double gross domestic product, Tokyo can't stump up more taxpayer cash for moribund firms. No wonder Elpida looked to the U.S. for a white knight. Also Sharp, faced with a $16 billion debt load and rapidly falling earnings, also has sought a rescue overseas, from Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry.
Some Wall Street firms aren't waiting until the Volcker rule kicks in to shake up the trading desks that wager the banks' own money.</br></br>As the financial-regulation overhaul heads toward a final vote in the Senate next week, banks are scrambling to find new positions for star proprietary traders, who basically trade company money in hopes of fattening bank profits and their own paychecks but could become an endangered species once the rule takes effect.</br></br>Citigroup Inc. is considering moving roughly two dozen proprietary traders onto desks that trade with company clients, according to people familiar with the situation. Other firms already have switched proprietary traders to customer-focused trading operations.</br></br>The moves don't necessarily mean the days of wagering with a bank's capital are numbered. Many expect an increase in risk-taking in trading operations that cater to clients as traders build an inventory of stocks and bonds to meet demand from hedge funds, money managers and other customers.</br></br>At Morgan Stanley, one proprietary trader whose desk was closed after the financial crisis now trades using capital from a trading desk that serves stock-trading clients, said a person familiar with the matter. Another Morgan Stanley proprietary trader who left for Deutsche Bank AG also essentially bets with the German bank's capital on a trading desk for clients, this person added.
HE POTOMAC LOOKS different down in Virginia near where Popes Creek joins the river. More serene, wider of course, tree-fringed and offering vistas that stretch the eye. It must have looked much the same when Thomas Lee, planter, burgess and acting governor of Virginia, built Stratford Hall in the 1720s and Augustine Washington built the house, upriver a bit, where George was bom.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢	Tucked away off the beaten track in Westmoreland County, these two famous plantations are ohly a little more than a couple of horns from Washington and a nice excursion into the rural countryside. Both afford a glimpse into domestic life in the early 18th century that surprises us 20th-century voyeurs. Drive onto the roads that, lead to these houses from Rte. 3E and you drive clean out of our era ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ not because of the oxen and the costumed employes, but because this land was part of the beginning of America.</br></br>The Lees, of course, are as close as we come in this country to aristocracy, and the ancestral home .ia as impressive in its setting as any English castle. Stratford has had no majt.ï¿½Ûª- changes since 1730. It was occupied until L822 by members of the Lee family, that remarkable line that produced two signers of the Declaration of Independence and a general of the Annies of the Confederacy. The lineage is all set forth in the re- ception center through which you pass before entering the house, and itï¿½Ûªs worth a quick look; the generations do confuse. You may, however, get sidetracked looking at the family christening dress and some of the Lee jewelry, like the mourning locket, in the adjacent cases.</br></br>There are only a few actual Lee pieces among the furniture in Stratford, but everything is authentic to the period, 1630-1810. The costumed hostesses, steeped in the Lee genealogy and each wearing a necklace featuring the squirrel so prominent in the Lee coat of arms, are full of wonderful stories about life in the old house.</br></br>Surely the most touching is the one about Robert E. Lee, not yet 4, who had to leave home with his mother and younger brothers when his half-brother inherited the house. With the coach waiting in the courtyard to take them to a new home, Robert turned up missing. After an extensive search, the child was discovered crouching in the nursery, whispering goodbye to the angels embossed against the back of the fireplace. Get down on your knees and look at the angels or you will regret it.
Middle ground was scarce at a District Commissionersï¿½Ûª hearing yesterday on proposed liberalization of the cityï¿½Ûªs unemployment compensation payments.</br></br>Chief among the suggested amendments was one which would increase the current maximum payment from $30 to $46 a week.</br></br>Enthusiastic backers argued that the present schedule is ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½hopelessly inadequateï¿½Û and hasnï¿½Ûªt kept pace with the cost of living. Critics cited alleged abuses of the program, charging that the payments some-j times amount to no more than' ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½free vacationsï¿½Û for the lazy.</br></br>The proposal would raise the present weekly maximum from the flat amount of $30 to a sum representing one-half the average weekly wage of all persons covered by the program. The average wage now is about $92.</br></br>Jobless persons may collect for as long as 26 weeks in any 1-year period. The payments are financed by a tax on employers.
Thursday's "stress-test" results will bring fresh scrutiny to the nation's biggest banks. They also are likely to highlight the woes from commercial real-estate loans that are piling up at large and small banks alike.</br></br>In the worst-case scenario, federal regulators examining the 19 largest U.S. banks are projecting losses of up to 12% on commercial real-estate loans over two years, according to a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The regulators are likelyto cite commercial-property debt problems as a major reason why at least some of the large banks need additional capital.</br></br>Such losses likely would cause even deeper misery, and risk of failure, at small and medium banks because they tend to have disproportionally more exposure to commercial real-estate loans than giant institutions. While regulators have indicated they won't allow the 19 stress-tested banks to fail, that group doesn't include more than 500 banks with assets of less than $1 billion that have too much exposure to commercial real estate and are at the most risk of failing, according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics LLC.</br></br>During the housing boom, small and regional banks doubled down on lending to home builders and commercial-property developers and investors as they were largely squeezed out of the home mortgage market by large banks and Wall Street firms. Now many of those loans are going bad as vacancies rise, rents fall and developments open to anemic demand.</br></br>Analysts already had been forecasting hundreds of bank closures in the next five years. The stress-test assumptions, including a 10.3% jobless rate at the end of 2010, raise the specter that some of the failures could occur sooner.
Despite continued falling unemployment in Maryland and Virginia, the jobless rates in their depressed areas are three times greater than that of the states as a whole.</br></br>Overall jobless rates dropped again in May for both states, but in some areas of Virginia unemployment was above 17 percent, and some parts of Maryland had unemployment of more than 9.5 percent.</br></br>Marylandï¿½Ûªs Department of Employment and Training reported yesterday that the stateï¿½Ûªs jobless rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 3.7 percent.</br></br>Virginiaï¿½Ûªs Employment Commission said last week that the Commonwealth's jobless rate fell 0.4 percentage point to 4.9 percent. Both states attributed the improved rates to seasonal gains and a healthy national economy. The District of Columbia, which had a 6.5 See JOBS, E3, Col. 1</br></br>In southwestern Virginia, news of the statewide drop in unemployment wasnï¿½Ûªt much cause for celebration. Falling oil prices have caused a 17.2 percent jobless rate in Dickenson County and a 16.8 percent unemployment rate in Buchanan County, both heavily dependent on coal mining. In Lancaster County, on the Northern Neck, seasonal improvements in the fishing industry have resulted in a 3-percentage-point reduction in unemployment, but it's still at 14.4 percent.
A disturbingly strong inflation report hurt bond prices and sent stocks skidding in the sharpest decline since the powerful rally began more than a month ago.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 33.17 points to 2899.01 in heavy trading. Long-term Treasury bonds lost nearly 1/2 point, or nearly $5 for each $1,000 of face amount, sending the yield on the Treasury's benchmark issue to 8.03%.</br></br>The dollar was mixed, gaining against the mark but losing ground against the yen.</br></br>Analysts said the government's report on the January consumer price index surprised investors. Consumer prices last month rose 0.4%, or 4.8% on an annualized basis. Worse, the so-called core rate of inflation, excluding food and energy prices, last month was up 0.8%, or 9.6% annually. Analysts had expected an increase of 0.3% in the overall consumer price index and only 0.4% in the core rate.</br></br>"The CPI was surprisingly high and that gave the bond market an excuse to take profits," said Kenneth Spence, director of the technical analysis group at Salomon Brothers. "That, in turn, provided investors with an excuse to take profits in the stock market."
NEW YORK--Gold and silver futures fell as investors worried that an upbeat U.S. jobs report would pave the way for the Federal Reserve to taper off its stimulus efforts.</br></br>Gold for August delivery, the most active contract, settled $39.20, or 3.1%, lower at $1,212.70 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.</br></br>Silver for September delivery fell 96.4 cents, or 4.9%, to $18.736 an ounce.</br></br>Both precious metals took heavy losses after Labor Department data showed U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by 195,000 in June, surpassing forecasts for a 160,000 increase. The unemployment rate, compiled from a separate survey, held steady at 7.6%.</br></br>Gold traders worry that the stronger data will lead the Fed to pare back its $85-billion-a-month bond-purchasing program, which has kept interest rates low and lent support to the gold market.
David Kearns, chairman and chief executive of Xerox Corp., got his first lesson in ethics at his mother's knee.</br></br>One way to stay out of trouble, she advised, was to always tell the truth. That way you don't have trouble getting your story straight.</br></br>It was the simple, old-fashioned way to learn about right and wrong. But in the wake of Watergate, Ivan Boesky, scandals in the defense industry and big-time deal-making, many companies are finding that teaching employees that lesson is a tough and complex job.</br></br>"Companies increasingly are concerned about ethics ... because the cost of behaving unethically can be great," said Gary Edwards, executive director of the Ethics Resource Center. "They hope their efforts will prevent misconduct but also bind people to the company and that has implications for productivity and quality."</br></br>Michael Hoffman, director of the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College, said it's not that business people are less ethical today, but that the pressures of competition sometimes lead employees to compromise their personal integrity to satisfy what they mistakenly believe are company goals.
If you were an English major in the '60s or '70s, chances are you took a course in the Jewish novel and read books by Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud and Philip Roth. These days, Bellow's not politically correct enough for many professors, Malamud's largely forgotten, Philip Roth is just a novelist, not a Jewish one, and few of those teaching the dozens of younger novelists who happen to be Jewish would identify them that way.</br></br>Besides, as far as classroom focus goes, most of those coming of age in literature these days are women, whether Jewish or Gentile. Students used to read about young Jewish guys on the way up, but Augie March and Alexander Portnoy have been replaced by the heroines of Candace Bushnell, both in books and, thanks to student interest in film and TV, in such forms as the "Sex and the City" series, which gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "on the make." This curricular shift is as it should be, given the current concern with the role of women, even if it minimizes the more parlous place of the Jew in the Western canon (there's no play called "The Desperate Housewife of Venice").</br></br>If the chapter in U.S. literary history called The Jewish Novel has closed, Steven G. Kellman brings us back to its strange beginnings in his lucid, highly readable biography of a writer whose life is as peculiar as anything in his fiction. Bellow, Malamud and company needed an ancestor to add gravitas to their mid-century Renaissance, and they found him in Henry Roth, who wrote Call It Sleep in 1934 and then lapsed into six decades of nearly total silence, spending most of those years as a waterfowl farmer in Maine and erupting in his eighties in a volcanic flood of prose that yielded thousands of pages just before his death.</br></br>Born Herschel Roth in 1906 in Galicia, a region of Austro- Hungary, the future novelist crossed the Atlantic as a babe in his mother's arms, traveling in steerage as part of the massive Jewish immigration that eventually made New York the capital of the Diaspora. The family moved around New York, spending just four years on the Lower East Side, which would become the cosmos of Call It Sleep. His mother never really learned English, and his father was a failure at making a living and at fatherhood. (Late in life, after Roth married Muriel Parker and had a family of his own, the father described him as "a schmo who had married a shiksa and didn't amount to anything.") An indifferent student, Roth profited from City College of New York's populist admissions policy. But his real literary education came from bohemian friends who introduced him to writers like James Joyce and T.S. Eliot.</br></br>The ennui and alienation of Eliot's personae appealed to Roth, and Kellman points out that, in composing Call It Sleep, the novelist took from Joyce the goal of transforming the quotidian into art, the idea for the self-portrait of the artist as a young man and the stream-of-consciousness technique. Call It Sleep tells the story of six years in the life of an immigrant boy named David Schearl just prior to World War I. David is protected by a loving mother, but his increasingly paranoid father can't hold down a job and makes life hell for them all. The squalor Roth depicted offended some critics, though others praised the gritty details as true to life. But in 1934, when unemployment exceeded 20 percent, relatively few readers were interested in throwing their disposable cash at an unknown writer, especially one with so troubling a story to tell, and within two years Call It Sleep was out of print.
QWe signed a contract to purchase our first home last week, and settlement is scheduled for mid-May. Before the contract was signed, we shopped around for the best mortgage. After the real estate contract was signed, we immediately contacted the lender we had selected and made a formal application. The lender asked us if we want to lock in the interest rate.</br></br>This is our first house, and we have absolutely no understanding of the way the mortgage market works, so we did not understand his question. However, he explained that if we lock in by signing a document called a "loan lock-in," the rate the lender quoted would be guaranteed as long as settlement takes place by the time specified in the sales contract. We know that interest rates are on the rise. Will this lock-in document protect us?</br></br>AA lock-in agreement will be your best protection, but all terms and conditions must be spelled out clearly and the document must be in writing.</br></br>In the past few years, mortgage interest rates have been at their all-time low. So potential borrowers were satisfied with their under- 6 percent rates. But now that rates are on the rise, potential home buyers want absolute certainty that the loan they have arranged will in fact be available on the day of closing. I believe that we have seen the last of the under-6 percent loan rates, at least for the foreseeable future. Thus, the concept of locking in your mortgage interest rate becomes important.</br></br>You are concerned that your lender will honor its commitment to you. This is understandable. Even if you can afford a higher-rate loan, you may now have a double problem: I strongly suspect that because property values have dramatically escalated in the past few years, you probably agreed to pay a high price for your house and a higher mortgage rate will mean an even larger monthly payment.
WASHINGTON -- Industrial production fell in December for the third consecutive month, offering bleak news on the state of America's smokestack economy.</br></br>The 0.2% drop last month followed declines of 0.2% in November and 0.1% in October, the Federal Reserve Board said. A string of strong growth numbers last spring and early summer had seemed to indicate that the industrial sector was recovering, but the more recent figures from the Federal Reserve cast doubt on that.</br></br>"This is not a free fall," said Stuart Hoffman, senior economist for PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, referring to a term President Bush used last week in New Hampshire to describe the economy. "But industrial production was a source of strength for the economy last spring, and now it is a source of weakness."</br></br>Most of the decline in industrial production last month stemmed from a 3% drop in output of utilities; unusually warm weather reduced demand for electricity. Factories posted an 0.1% gain in output after declining 0.3% the month before. The auto industry, struggling to cope with excess inventories, cut output of cars and trucks 2.3%.</br></br>Mr. Hoffman predicted that autos will continue to be a source of problems in the first quarter and will drag industrial production figures down.
multitude of corporate earnings have been SOb released for the first quarter of 1988, and they Hffl have been surprisingly good. It was initially believed that earnings would be up 5 percent to 10 percent, but they have been running a hefty 15 percent to 20 percent. Oddly enough, the stock market has not responded that positively to these upbeat earnings due to inflation fears and rising interest rates.</br></br>It also is interesting to note that the quality credit ratings on corporate fixed-income securities have continued to decline in the face of the good earnings. Moodyï¿½Ûªs Investment Service just released their corporate review for the quarter, and it highlights these seemingly paradoxical events.</br></br>Of the 109 companies that incurred rating changes, 75 (69 percent) were downgraded and 34 (31 percent) were upgraded. A year ago, downgrades were 64 percent of the total.</br></br>The 75 companies that were downgraded had $137 billion in debt issues that were affected, compared to only $14 billion of debt securities of the 34 companies that were upgraded. The bulk of these came from two areas: automotive and banking.</br></br>A whopping $52 billion was represented by the downgrading of General Motors Corp. and its financing arm. General Motors Acceptance Corp. Another $40 billion of downgrades occurred with the lowering of the credit ratings by Moodyï¿½Ûªs on eight money center banks. These downgradings were simply a continuation of the deterioration of the quality of bank loans, including loans to Latin American countries.
NEW DELHI -- India's main software trade body Tuesday reiterated its estimate of the industry recording 16%-18% growth in export revenue this fiscal year, despite fears of economic troubles in the main outsourcing markets.</br></br>The National Association of Software and Services Companies, or Nasscom, had in February forecast the industry's export revenue at $68 billion-$70 billion in the fiscal year that started April 1.</br></br>"We don't see any reasons to do it [revise outlook]," Som Mittal, president of the association, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event. "We had factored in a little bit of uncertainty when we gave the 16%-18% growth outlook."</br></br>Though Mr. Mittal said there was no reason to get worried about the current volatile economic environment, he added that there is a "need to be cautious."</br></br>Mr. Mittal's comments come after Infosys Ltd., India's second-largest software exporter by sales, Sunday warned about clients holding back their technology budgets if delays in taking spending decision persist in a weak economic environment.
Author: Katy Burne</br></br>NEW YORK--Johnson & Johnson is set to price its $1.1 billion, two-part bond offering at the lowest rates ever for 10-year and 30-year bonds, in a sign that investors are continuing to bet on corporate debt at a time of record-low interest rates on government bonds.</br></br>Corporations with the best credit ratings have been able to take advantage of this demand and raise cash very cheaply. Some of the best-known issuers that have tapped the debt markets at near record-low rates in recent weeks include International Business Machines Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</br></br>The tranches on the deal are split equally, with $550 million in each maturity bucket, and the issuer is on track to borrow at interest rates around 3.10% for the 10-year maturity and 4.5% for the 30-year paper if market conditions hold, according to one person familiar with the sale.</br></br>The lowest rates on record for these maturities to date were scored in recent weeks by McDonald's Corp. and Northern States Power Co. of Minnesota, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc.
Riddle: What do the Pentagon and the Federal Reserve Board have in common?</br></br>Answer: Both are always prepared to fight the last war they won.</br></br>For years now, the Pentagon has concentrated its planning on a replay of World War II, with the American Navy controlling the North Atlantic, American ships ferrying troops and supplies to the European front, etc., etc. It regards military intervention in Central America, the Middle East or anywhere else as an irritating distraction from its major goal, which is to fight and defeat the Soviets in Western Europe, just as it did the Nazis. That this happens to be the conflict that, time after time, history perversely fails to place at the top of the American postwar agenda is regarded as a temporary aberration, best disregarded.</br></br>Similarly, the Fed under Paul Volcker won a great victory over inflation in the early 1980s, has been wreathed in laurels for achieving that victory and is determined to conduct that war all over again -- even if there are other, more pressing battles to be fought. In the course of mobilizing popular support for this war, the Fed has been trying its best, with considerable success, to instill a sense of panic in the business community and the media about the huge budget deficits and the inflationary danger they pose. Mr. Volcker is demanding that Congress cut spending and increase taxes. Until it does so, the Fed is keeping money and credit relatively tight and interest rates high, as its continuing contribution to the war against inflation.</br></br>Indeed, the Fed has been so successful in its propaganda that there has been little serious analysis of why we have such huge budget deficits in the first place. Which, from the Fed's point of view, is just as well, since such an analysis would reveal that in large measure the current deficit is a Volcker deficit and that the war against inflation that he won has many of the aspects of a Pyrrhic victory.
A chart Monday incorrectly reported the poverty rate in Los Angeles and the proportion of the city's population made up of blacks. The poverty rate is 18.9 percent and 14 percent of city residents are black. (Published 5/13/92)</br></br>Enormous social and economic changes swept over the city of Los Angeles during the 1980s, including rising poverty and unemployment and a wave of immigration that transformed the city's racial profile, according to census figures released today.</br></br>The detailed statistics, issued early by the Census Bureau to help guide the city in rebuilding from the recent riots, underscore the metamorphosis that many say helped set the stage for the violent upheaval.</br></br>At the heart of that change is an increasingly multi-ethnic population, fueled by the arrival of more than 750,000 immigrants since 1980. When the census was taken in 1990, nearly 40 percent of city residents were foreign-born, an increase of two-thirds in just a decade.</br></br>Hispanics and Asians together now make up half of the city's population, while both the white and the black share fell. And language and cultural forces made the new racial dynamic even more complex: Half of all Los Angeles residents speak a language other than English at home and, of those, the majority said they did not speak English very well.
The price of cotton has tripled over the past year, and the textile industryï¿½Ûªs shrieks of anguish and despair grow steadily more audible. The sudden, shocking leap in cotton prices is owed partly to the Agriculture Departmentï¿½Ûªs misguided decision last winter to reduce acreage allotments to keep prices from falling. It is also partly owed to a massive and unprecedented flow of exports that, it turns out, the Treasury Department is subsidizing. The case of cotton sharply illustrates the obsolete policies and official evasions that are grievously aggravating J;he inflation in farm products.</br></br>The price of cotton was 27 cents a pound a year ago. It had sunk a bit over the course of the summer, and the Agriculture Department decided to cut this yearï¿½Ûªs acreage. Perhaps the department was also trying to save a little money. It had promised the White House to cut down the farm subsidy outlays, as its contribution to reducing Mr. Mixonï¿½Ûªs budget deficit. In any event, the acreage planted in cotton last spring was well below the 1972 level.</br></br>Then the export boom got under way, led by tremendous purchases from Japan. In early September, Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) called on the administration to impose export controls on cotton. In response, that invaluable organization,' Tax Analysts and Advocates, pointed out that the Treasury Department is actually subsidizing the cotton exports under a provision that, in the very different circumstances of previous years. Senator Talmadge himself had forced upon it. The subsidy operates through a device known as the Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) which, to put it briefly, is a tax dodge intended to induce manufacturers not to move their factories abroad. Applying DISC to agriculture is, of course, ludicrous. When did you last hear of a runaway cotton field being shipped to Taiwan?</br></br>The farmers who sell cotton are not, at the moment, complaining. But it is another matter for the manufacturers who buy it. The textile industryï¿½Ûªs trade association bitterly denounces the shortages and warns that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the enormous raw material cost increases, unless moderated, inevitably will result in hundreds of millions of dollars of price increases to consumers.ï¿½Û The latest Wholesale Price Index, published a few days ago, shows that from August to September the prices of cotton textiles and</br></br>The sudden export boom is related to the turmoil in the worldï¿½Ûªs monetary system which, as the Wholesale Price Index suggests, has a certain relevance to the way things are going here at home. In the days when the United States kept the value of the dollar artificially high and Japan kept the yen artificially low, a huge amounUof dollars accumulated in Tokyo banks. By the time the dollar was devalued in late 1971, Japanï¿½Ûªs dollar reserves were larger than the U.S. governmentï¿½Ûªs. The then Secretary of the Treasury, John Connally, declared that those reserves could not be converted into gold and, in his customary engaging manner, told the rest of the world that they could like it or lump it. Tile Japanese, it develops, did neither. Like most other holders of dollars abroad, they began converting their dollars into such commodities as cotton. The world is now off the gold standard and on what you might call the cotton-soybean-copper standard. If we could design a mechanism to protect the commodities against sudden speculative swoops and pounces, it would be quite a good system.
WASHINGTON -- For years, the Navy, seeking a breakthrough in anti-submarine warfare, bankrolled a plan to detect subs by sensing their magnetic emanations.</br></br>So far, this technology has failed for the Navy, but the Navy encouraged Biomagnetic Technologies Inc. to incorporate it into a brain-scanning machine. The device, called a neuromagnetometer, can detect brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy simply by reading the magnetic discharges from nerve cells.</br></br>"We helped BTI and other Navy contractors commercialize their products in the knowledge that what helps them would eventually advance technology helpful to the Navy, too," says Donald Gubser at the Naval Research Laboratory here.</br></br>Such assistance reflects a government effort to plant the fruits of publicly financed research in the marketplace. The huge U.S. trade deficit stirs concern that the U.S. doesn't turn discoveries into products quickly enough. "We win the Nobel Prizes, but the Japanese get most of the profits," says Sen. Ernest Hollings, a South Carolina Democrat who heads the Senate Commerce, Science and Technology Committee. Seeking to make U.S. industry more competitive, Congress passed the Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986, which requires the government to speed diffusion of technology from its labs.</br></br>But the military-reform lobby, cynical about the administration's motives, charges that the program is a way to promote President Reagan's controversial Strategic Defense Initiative. "This is part of the administration's attempt to sell Star Wars as the road to America's technological renaissance," says Brian McCartan, a senior analyst at the Washington-based Center for Defense Information. "As for the Pentagon's recent spinoff record, it isn't all that great."
Days after raising two key interest rates, Federal Reserve policymakers decided at a mid-August meeting not to tighten monetary policy further, according to a record of the meeting released yesterday.</br></br>However, the members of the central bank's policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) remained concerned about inflation prospects. A number of FOMC members indicated that they expected to have to boost interest rates again in the near future to slow economic growth enough to head off rising inflation.</br></br>A majority agreed that it "would be acceptable" to make cash less readily available to the banking systems in the weeks following the meeting, "depending on indications of inflationary pressures, the strength of the business expansion, the behavior of the monetary aggregates, and developments in foreign exchange and domestic financial markets."</br></br>On the other hand, making cash more readily available "might be acceptable," depending on economic developments, the Fed statement said.</br></br>Even that tilt toward a tighter policy and higher interest rates was not strong enough for Lee Hoskins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, one of the 12 voting members of the committee. He dissented "because he preferred a policy that would give less emphasis to near-term business conditions and exchange rate considerations and greater emphasis to the longer-term objective of price stability," the record said.
Plans by the United States to slap punitive duties on some electronics goods from Japan have demonstrated again that the perception gap between the two countries can be as wide as the Pacific Ocean.</br></br>At a time when U.S. officials are complaining that Japan sabotages trade agreements, the Japanese feel that no reasonable person can deny that they have made costly sacrifices in the past two years to help improve America's poor trade condition.</br></br>The fact that Japan's dollar surplus with the United States is not declining on annual terms-it set another record, $59 billion, in 1986-is not seen here as proof of bad faith. Patterns in world trade change at a glacial pace, the Japanese say, and Americans who show some patience will see the figure go down a bit in 1987.</br></br>Measured in volume rather than dollars, exports did fall a bit in 1986. "The change has already started," said Michihiko Kunihiro, chief of the Japanese cabinet's committee on external affairs. "But the political atmosphere makes people blind to it." He promises more efforts from Japan.</br></br>The Japanese still wince at the notion that they are flooding the world with exports. Every business transaction has two sides, after all. For every Toyota shipped to the United States by a Japanese, there is an American who wants to buy it.
NEW YORK, Sept. 21 (AP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market repeated an old trick today, losing ground in early trading and firming near the close.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off over 5 points during the session, ended the day with a .76 loss to close at 939.49.</br></br>This seesaw pattern characterized trading Wednesday and Monday. A slight variation Tuesday saw prices rise during the day only to drop off in late trading.</br></br>Prices dropped for the 14th straight day on the American Stock Exchange, and Over-the-Counter issues also lost ground.</br></br>The Amex price-change index was off .03 to 26.06, its lowest point since Jan. 6. Volume was 2.74 million shares, down from 3.07 million Wednesday.
The committee of academic economists that dates the beginning and end of U.S. recessions stopped short of calling an end to the downturn that started in December 2007, drawing public criticism from a committee member.</br></br>Most members of the National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee have said the recession probably ended in mid-2009, when several key economic indicators reached their trough and the economy started growing again.</br></br>But the seven-member group said Monday that it wasn't ready to mark the official end date, given the chance -- however small -- that the economy could start shrinking again or that revised data could shift the timing of the economy's low point.</br></br>"Although most indicators have turned up, the committee decided that the determination of the trough date on the basis of current data would be premature," the committee said. "Many indicators are quite preliminary at this time and will be revised in coming months."</br></br>The decision bred controversy on the committee, underscoring the range of opinions about the state of the economy.
Conceding that the Asian economic crisis has had a more severe impact here than first expected, Hong Kong's leaders today said the territory was heading into a recession, and they unveiled a stimulus package aimed at reviving the economy and stemming a huge downward slide in property prices.</br></br>Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa, who announced the stimulus package in a television address to the territory's 7 million residents, said the regional economic meltdown that began a year ago has proven "more devastating than anything we had known before." "The effects of the turmoil are more serious and far-reaching than we have anticipated," Tung said. He cited high interest rates, a debilitating credit crunch, the highest unemployment rate in 15 years, collapsing stock and property markets and a tourist industry he said was "shrinking."</br></br>"All Hong Kong assets have been devalued and shrunk to a large extent within a few months," Tung said in his most somber assessment yet of the territory's economic straits. "Every sign points to the fact that negative economic growth will likely continue in the second quarter. The unemployment rate will probably continue to rise, and the economic situation for the second half of the year is hardly optimistic." Tung's bleak analysis, and the announcement of the stimulus package, was yet another sign of the depth and severity of the regionwide meltdown. Once touted as a "miracle" model of growth and development, East Asia has in the course of just 12 months come to be identified as a region with millions of new unemployed people, bankrupt banks, piles of bad debt and a fraying social fabric.</br></br>Hong Kong was once thought to be an island of financial stability amid the regional turmoil. Its currency is firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar, so the territory avoided the round of devaluations that swept through Asia last year. Its banks are generally considered healthier than elsewhere. And its now-departed British colonialists left behind an effective legal system and a professional civil service that have largely spared Hong Kong from the problems of corruption and nepotism that are common across the region.</br></br>Today, however, Tung conceded that some of the current problems "can also be attributed to the internal factors in our own economy." He said the spiraling land prices, high wages and high inflation of recent years had created a "bubble economy."
He put a beautiful Lady Liberty and a majestic flaming torch on the silver and gold coins, and he named them "Liberty Dollars." On his Web site, www.libertydollar.org, he said: "It is fun to use REAL money. Liberty Dollars are a proven and profitable currency that protects and grows the purchasing power of your money!"</br></br>True story, phony money. So says the U.S. Mint, which would like to remind Liberty Dollar users that since the United States already has its own currency, the only thing Liberty Dollars buy in these parts is a jail term.</br></br>Liberty Dollars were coined by von NotHaus and an Evansville, Ind.-based group called Norfed, which stands for (sort of) the National Organization for the Repeal of the Federal Reserve Act and the Internal Revenue Code. In the late 1990s, the group began hawking its money as a hedge against inflation, and as a way to compete with the Fed. Von NotHaus makes the pitch online, using a raft of statistics and graphs that he says show the greenback is well nigh worthless.</br></br>Norfed Executive Director Michael Johnson says the group isn't aiming to overthrow the American monetary system. "We're not locking horns with the Fed. I mean, that's crazy," he said. Norfed simply wants "to offer a solution to the Federal Reserve Note," a.k.a. U.S. dollars.</br></br>Norfed struck the first gold- and silver-backed coins -- which, to avoid charges of making its own money it calls "rounds" -- in 1998 at its private mint in Idaho. Today the group claims to have more than $20 million in Liberty coins and notes in circulation, and about 2,500 merchants who accept Liberty Dollars for goods and services from doughnuts to tattoos.
I know things have been rough lately, with the stock market acting crazy and everything. And I know some of your portfolios are, well, quite portable.</br></br>But just because youï¿½Ûªve had to dump the Porsche, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, all is not lost. I gotta car for you:</br></br>Itï¿½Ûªs a terrific piece. Goes just as fast on legal highways as your Porsche 944. Itï¿½Ûªs a heck of a lot more comfortable than your 300-series BMW. And, though it shamefully lacks an air bag, itï¿½Ûªs equipped as well as some of your pricier Mercy Bï¿½Ûªs.</br></br>And, hey, unless you really got wiped out in Wall Streetï¿½Ûªs on-again, off-again crash, you can pay for the Mark VII and still hold onto your condo. I mean, here's your chance to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½step downï¿½Û without anybody noticing.</br></br>Only problem is, the Mark VUï¿½Ûªs an American car. Many of you have a hard time dealing with that. But, like Iï¿½Ûªve been telling you for a couple of years, thatï¿½Ûªs a goofed-up, wacko attitude.
PUERTO RICO'S largest mortgage lender didn't answer all the questions about its books in a 195-page earnings restatement this week. It did say enough to convince some that the island's banking industry is in trouble.</br></br>Some of the disclosures by Doral Financial Corp., which faces a criminal investigation by the U.S. attorney's office in New York, feed into a view held on Wall Street that several of Puerto Rico's banks are operated more like private clubs than public companies. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating Doral.</br></br>In its restatement Monday, Doral said 2004 net income was $214.8 million, 56% lower than originally reported. The main culprit in the restatement: improper valuations on certain mortgage-related transactions.</br></br>"This is bad for everyone," Avi Barak, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill in New York, says about the effect on several other Puerto Rican banks. Mr. Barak doesn't cover Doral, but he has "sell" ratings on First BanCorp and R&G Financial Corp., two Puerto Rican lenders under investigation by the SEC for the way they accounted for mortgage deals with Doral.</br></br>Specifically, Doral didn't put accurate values on some of the mortgage assets it sold to other banks. Those assets, called interest- only strips, or IOs, are likely to end up back on Doral's balance sheet after the other banks' auditors reclassify them as loans instead of sales, as required by generally accepted accounting principles.
NEW YORK -- Stocks staged a broad rally as Bed Bath & Beyond rose on a profit report and SLM spiked on an analyst upgrade.</br></br>Investors seem to be changing their mind every couple days about when they think the economy is going to bottom, said Uri Landesman, head of global growth strategies at ING Investment Management. "Investors wanted to see the glass as half full [Thursday]. They were taking pieces of news and interpreting it positively," he said. "I'm not sure we can say: Happy days are here again."</br></br>Positive earnings from a retailer helped consumer-discretionary stocks do well. Bed Bath & Beyond (Nasdaq) gained $2.69, or 9.5%, to $31.08. The retailer's fiscal first-quarter profit jumped 14% on higher sales.</br></br>SLM, commonly known as Sallie Mae, added 87 cents, or 10%, to 9.20. J.P. Morgan upgraded the stock to "overweight," saying that the company's transition to primarily a loan servicer will lower interest-rate and funding risks, thus improving earnings visibility.</br></br>Nike fell 1.74, or 3.3%, to 51.28. The shoemaker's fiscal fourth-quarter profit dropped 30% on $195 million in restructuring charges, as revenue and margins slid and future orders dropped in all regions.
The answer, so far, is the federal thrift savings plan. The 17.07 percent rate is the average annual return for the C-fund (stock index) since it became available to investors in 1988. During the same period, the average return for the F-fund (bond index) was 8.28 percent. The super-safe (no market ups and downs!) G-fund, invested in Treasury securities, had a return of 7.55 percent.</br></br>Those numbers, compiled by Dennis M. Gurtz, a Bethesda- based financial planner, are important since feds are in the midst of their open-enrollment season for the savings plan. They have until the end of July to join the plan or redirect where their future payroll-deducted investments will go.</br></br>Past performance doesn't indicate what a stock, bond or Treasury fund will do in the future, but it clearly shows where it has been. And the C-fund, despite the ups and downs of the stock market, has been on a long-term roll riding the bull market.</br></br>In calendar 1996, the C-fund returned 22.85 percent. In 1995, its return was 37.41 percent. In 1994 (when many people bailed out), it returned only 1.33 percent. For the same three years, the F-fund returns were 3.66 percent, 18.31 percent and minus 2.9 percent. The G-fund track record was 6.76 percent in 1996, 7.03 percent in 1995 and 7.22 percent in 1994.</br></br>Gurtz said the year-to-date returns for the funds are 15.40 percent for the C-fund, 1.86 percent for the F-fund and 2.83 percent for the G-fund. The C-fund was up 6.07 percent for the month of May, and the June numbers -- so far -- look equally good.
Andree Aelion Brooks's "Children of Fast-Track Parents" is really two books mingled together. The first book could be entitled "The Pain and Dangers of Growing Up Rich," and it is an excellent analysis of the pressures that more than 5 million children face growing up in families with incomes of $75,000 or more per year.</br></br>Brooks is a mother of grown children and a journalist who specializes in family issues. She has written pieces for McCalls, Woman's Day and The New York Times.</br></br>In February 1987, Brooks attended a workshop called "Where Do We Go From the Garden of Eden?" held in her home town of Westport, Conn. Psychologists, school administrators and clergy discussed the problems of rearing children in an affluent community.</br></br>Brooks wrote about the workshop in The New York Times Magazine, and the response was so enormous that she decided to write this book. As part of her research she interviewed children, parents, teachers, psychiatrists, psychologists and guidance counselors.</br></br>One of the book's major contributions is simply to bring the problems of wealthy children out into the open. In a world full of poverty, fortunate children are often embarrassed to admit that they have any problems at all, but in conversations with Brooks they revealed over and over again that pain accompanies privilege.
The dollar's slump worsened in the third quarter as economies chugged back to life and investors moved their cash into riskier investments in search of higher returns.</br></br>The greenback may tumble further in coming weeks as investors bet that other countries will raise interest rates before the Federal Reserve, boosting returns on those currencies. But the dollar's weakness could come to a halt if it drops too low: Eventually, policy makers in Asia and Europe may start complaining that a weak dollar hurts their ability to export goods to the U.S., which could help the buck, while bearish investors may move to lock in profits by unwinding negative bets.</br></br>"There's potential for a little more pain, but the dollar's weakness has pretty much run its course," says Alan Wilde, head of fixed income and currency at Baring Asset Management in London.</br></br>In the quarter, the dollar lost 4.1% of its value against the euro and dropped 6.8% against the Japanese yen, dipping to 89.77 yen on Monday, its lowest level since late January. The dollar's losing streak, which began when stocks started rallying in March, has picked up steam in recent months. Currencies of big commodity-producing nations soared against the dollar, with Australia's currency rising 9.5% partly on optimism about China, a big buyer of its natural resources.</br></br>While the dollar was weak, the British pound was even weaker. It lost 2.9% against the dollar and 6.9% against the euro. That decline came after the pound gained 15% against the greenback in the second quarter.
The sniper murdering at will in the Washington area is a metaphor for the defining characteristic of our new era. It is not terrorism, not an unsteady economy, not the threat of a new war in Iraq -- not even the danger of random assassins. It is risk.</br></br>Though risk never vanished, we forgot about it in the 1990s. We effectively abolished large national risks -- though not small private risks -- through a series of public myths. We presumed that we could control our surroundings in ways that would provide a permanent security and allow most of us to retreat into our private worlds. Because this was a fantasy, we have become victims of our own delusions.</br></br>Myth number one was that, as the "sole remaining superpower," we were gradually molding the world in our image. After the Cold War, American ideas of democracy and economic freedom emerged triumphant. Global problems were increasingly distant and decreasingly dangerous, because more nations were thinking and acting like us.</br></br>A second myth was the "new economy." Economic anxieties declined as the stock market rose and unemployment fell. People felt liberated from traditional economic fears. Politics receded in importance -- it seemed less essential to people's well-being -- and became increasingly regarded as entertainment. For a while, it focused on the constitutional consequences of the president's sex drive.</br></br>All this involves, of course, breathtaking generalization. During these years, there were issues that mattered and dangers that intruded. We waged a small war in Kosovo; AIDS continued to advance; crime remained; Asia suffered a financial crisis. But in some ways, the exceptions seemed to confirm the retreat of risk. The air war in Kosovo was fought without American casualties; new drugs combated AIDS; crime declined; and the economy seemed resilient to Asia's crisis.
Official Washington and would-be presidents are scrambling to come up with credible - or at least sound-bite-worthy - plans to stimulate the economy. Inevitably, the debate goes to the budget deficit and, to underscore its size, its relationship to the amount of the GNP - an arbitrary ratio having no analytical significance.</br></br>What really matters is the impact of the deficit on the capital markets, where private and public borrowers compete with the federal government for funds and run the risk of being "crowded out" when rates become prohibitively high. To gauge its potential for driving up interest rates and impeding the economy, the deficit should be measured against the domestic personal savings pool, which underwrites all forms of debt, ranging from Treasury and corporate borrowing to home mortgages. Here, the numbers are truly alarming.</br></br>During the 1970s, the deficit as a percentage of personal savings averaged 38 percent. It soared to 117 percent in the 1980s, topped 160 percent in 1991 and in 1992 will likely reach 225 percent.</br></br>Obviously, the United States no longer has a large enough pool of domestic savings to meet the financing needs of a healthy private economy in tandem with a burgeoning federal deficit. Even in a meandering economy with modest private credit demands, our domestic bond market is feeling the pinch. Long-term interest rates in the United States are considerably higher than the tempo of the economy and inflation in this country would seem to indicate. Financial market participants and borrowers are getting a preview of the future: a worldwide capital shortage and high real rates of interest.</br></br>What kept interest rates from soaring during the extreme savings scarcity in the mid to late 1980s was a bounteous influx of funds from foreign investors, who filled the savings gap by purchasing billions of dollars of U.S. government securities. That's not apt to be repeated in the 1990s. Foreign investors are not as flush as they once were. At the same time, the triumph of market-oriented economic philosophies all over the world is accelerating the demand for investment capital.

NEW YORK, May 21ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market thumped to another seven-year low today, ignoring President Nixonï¿½Ûªs assurances that the economic slump will end in the second half of the year.</br></br>Prices dropped sharply at the opening, but recovered part of their losses early in the afternoon. Mr. Nixonï¿½Ûªs statement reached brokersï¿½Ûª news wires early in the afternoon and, far from helping the market, touched off a quick selling wave that had the Dow Jones industrial average down by slightly more than 20 points midway through the afternoon. A mild rally from there to the close cut the loss to 11.30 points and a close at 665.25.</br></br>16.7	million shares from 13.02 million shares on Wednesday. The exchangeï¿½Ûªs ticker tape ran late sporadically through the day as the volume climbed to the highest tdlai-sinf-e March 25, when 17.5 million shares changec hands in the aftermath of cuts in banksï¿½Ûª prime lending rates.</br></br>Analysts, however, were unwilling to say that the increases in volume indicate that the market may be approaching a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½selling climaxï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a very high volume session of, say 25 million shares, in which prices first plummet and then recover sharply. They pointed out that market activity has become more fragmented than in the past, with many institutions trading in listed stocks in the over-the-counter markets, so that volume figures provide a poor indicator.</br></br>The Presidentï¿½Ûªs reassurances hit Wall Street like the proverbial lead balloon. Brokers noted that stock prices showed no response at all until, finally, they dropped quickly. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Weï¿½Ûªre a fine bunch for him to tell everything is going according to schedule,ï¿½Û one broker complained.
ANNAPOLIS. Dec. 4 Gov.

For homeowners, these are the best of times. The economy has been expanding for 27 consecutive quarters. Over the past year, the stock market peaked and consumer confidence reached its highest level in 28 years. Mortgage interest and unemployment rates are the lowest they have been in decades. Real wages -- at least for the better-off -- are rising, and government coffers are overflowing. Even crime rates are down.</br></br>So it is only natural that home sales are breaking records and prices are beating inflation.</br></br>That's the conclusion of the latest Home Price Forecast, prepared for The Wall Street Journal by the economic research firm Case Shiller Weiss Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. The forecast reflects actual price changes in 10 of the largest metropolitan areas from August 1996 to August 1997 and projects figures to January 1999.</br></br>Not everyone feels like celebrating, however. In Chicago, where the economists predict the lowest price rises of the 10 metro areas, home prices are just keeping pace with inflation and houses are languishing on the market. "I've lowered my price $10,000, and there still have been no offers," says retired publisher Frank Albergo, whose 2,000-square-foot, turreted Norman-style home has been on the market for more than a year. It is currently listed at $239,000.</br></br>San Francisco, by contrast, is expected to remain the country's hottest and the most expensive housing market. Susan Sparks, a researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, expects a quick sale of her 2,046-square-foot tract home, recently listed for $205,000. She says 15 homes in her development have sold in the past six months, some "for their full listing price in two weeks or less."
Prices closed mixed on Wall Street today, bolstered by a stronger dollar and a recovery in Treasury bond prices, but buffeted by program trading and profit taking.</br></br>Big Board volume totaled 179.84 million shares, compared with 186.41 million in the previous session.</br></br>The Dow Jones average changed direction several times during the session while the margin of gainers to losers remained narrow.</br></br>"It's a battle of bargain hunters versus profit takers. The bargain hunters won in blue chips, and profit takers won elsewhere," said Michael Metz, a stock market analyst with Oppenheimer & Co.</br></br>They said the market took strength during the session from the stronger dollar and improvement in bond prices. On Tuesday, when the Dow Jones average tumbled more than 44 points, the decline was attributed to a weaker dollar and lower bonds.
NEW YORK, Oct. 7 UP).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½In the slowest session in more than five weeks, the stock market today held to a steady course.</br></br>The slowness was induced by the victory of the Yankees over the Dodgers 4 to 2. Attention was on the ball game, not the market.</br></br>During the morning there were flickers of action here and there. Chrysler with 3800 shares traded up % at 84V4 and North- ern Pacific with 7200 shares traded up 3A at 64% tried to spark a rally, and activity in those two stocks difl prove to be a preliminary show of strength in a mild rise.</br></br>Radio-televisions also came to life for a brief time, and the high-priced oils ran up some good gains, but that was about all.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks closed unchanged at $105.70 with the industrial component unchanged, the railroads up 10 cents, and the utilities down 20 cents.
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Index Technology Corp. will introduce tomorrow a product to help corporate software experts update old mainframe software programs, Richard Carpenter, chairman and chief executive officer, said.</br></br>The product, XL/Recover, marks a move into a new area of the software-engineering field that Index helped pioneer. It will be available next week. Index, the nation's biggest maker of products for the computer-aided software-engineering market, known as CASE, has previously made software tools to improve the productivity of programmers writing new programs.</br></br>In an interview, Mr. Carpenter said the XL/Recover software program, which will sell for $9,800 and runs on IBM-compatible personal computers, "is a major thrust in our offerings for 1991." He declined to predict sales but said it will "probably account for 10% to 25% of revenue" in the future.</br></br>Last year, Index earned $2.3 million, or 50 cents a share, on revenue of $38 million. During this year, Index has continued to grow rapidly, but earnings have declined. First-half net was $961,000, or 20 cents a share, down 21% from $1.2 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 39% to $24.4 million from $17.5 million.</br></br>Mr. Carpenter declined to predict earnings for the current quarter or the rest of the year. "This is continuing to be an investment year for Index. The good thing is we're beginning to get the results of all that investment into the marketplace," he said.
Discount carrier Southwest Airlines Co. said Monday that it plans to acquire smaller rival AirTran Holdings Inc., in a $1.4 billion cash-and-stock deal that reflects intensifying consolidation in the industry.</br></br>The friendly takeover would give Dallas-based Southwest a major presence at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the busiest in the world and AirTran's main hub. It would also extend Southwest's service outside the U.S. for the first time, with the addition of AirTran routes to Mexico and the Caribbean.</br></br>Southwest's expanded footprint could increase pressure on larger network airlines, particularly Delta Air Lines Inc., the dominant carrier in Atlanta. Those carriers are typically saddled with higher costs and charge steeper fares.</br></br>But Southwest also is entering uncharted territory after shying away from acquisitions for most of its history. The airline has produced 37 straight years of profits.</br></br>Airline mergers are picking up as the industry returns to profitability after soaring fuel prices and the recession pummeled demand for air travel.
NEW YORK, Nov. 28 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Blue chip issues set the pace as the stock market today continued making great strides along the recovery trail from a string of sharp setbacks.</br></br>Quoted values have now recouped nearly two-thirds of the deep losses suffered in the three-session series of declines which began last Friday.</br></br>High quality stocks, which were pounded severely in the recent selloffs, rebounded strongly. Eastman Kodak jumped 5 points, Goodyear 4% and American Telephone 2Ys. Zenith ran ahead 6%.</br></br>Generally, the rise among pivotal issues went from fractions to about 2 points. The advance swept most major sections but there were a few casualties.</br></br>Brokers regarded the performance as a continuation of the technical snapback which began in the pre-Thanksgiving session. Bullish news provided further incentive for the rise.
NEW YORK, June 18ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market rebounded from some early selling to finish mixed today, thanks to some late buying of blue chips.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 80 industrials, down about 13 points at midday, closed with a 3.16-point gain at 1,868.94.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrials dropped 8.41 points in the week's first two sessions. Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks slackened lately as evidence mounted that the pace of business activity remains subdued.</br></br>Before the opening today, the government revised downward its estimate of economic growth in the first quarter of this year.</br></br>The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, after adjustment for inflation and seasonal factors, in the January-March period, rather than t he 3.7 percent rate estimated earlier.
With the election over, itï¿½Ûªs time for both parties to get serious about the federal deficit Congress and the White House can follow two excellent blueprints, both viciously attacked during the CMMOTUyH campaign and both moving in the</br></br>Republicans' ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Contract With Americaï¿½Ûª and the Democrats' ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Rivlin memo," an Oct 3 option paper by budget director Alice Rivlin that was leaked to the press.</br></br>The similarities between these documents are striking. They agree that, despite last year's budget agreement there's a fiscal crisis ahead. While the deficit this year is expected to drop below $170 billion, it will start rising again next year and hit a record $319 billion by 2002.</br></br>Both documents see a balanced budget by the year 2000 as a sensible target With cooperation between the parties, itï¿½Ûªs really not so hard to achieveï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and, if you want, you can do it without touching Social Security.</br></br>The Rivtin memo estimates that if the budget Is balanced withï¿½ five years, the national savings rate will rise to 6.1 percent That will almost certainly mean a higher standard of living as private investment increases. But if the budget continues on its current path, the savings rate will be a mere 3.7 percentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a disaster for the United States in a competitive global economy where other nations save far more.
The dollar was modestly higher in Europe yesterday, buoyed by a narrower trade deficit. But it fell sharply against the Japanese yen, the principal focus of action by the United States and its major trading partners to lower the dollar. Gold slumped.</br></br>ria. Banks and other dealers traded for only about an hour before closing to get home ahead of the hurricane. Commodity markets and bullion traders also closed early.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The dollar had a reasonably steady day,ï¿½Û a London currency dealer said, citing U.S trade figures which were better than expected.</br></br>president at Discount Corp. of New York, .said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the feeling is that the dollar is now at an unusually low level and could bounce right back.ï¿½Û</br></br>The Group of Five agreement last Sunday that sent the dollar down was aimed mostly at strengthening the Japanese yen in an effort to head off trade barriers now being considered by Congress.
After two years of booming business, the nation's mortgage bankers are worried that their luck may not last much longer.</br></br>"Our business is doing very well while our economy is struggling," Warren Lasko, executive director of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said at the group's annual convention here this week.</br></br>Riding what Lasko and others called "an enormous wave of refinancing," bankers fear the next administration, which they believe will almost certainly be led by a President Bill Clinton, may drive up interest rates by creating new programs and regulations.</br></br>"The Clinton factor has already sparked substantial increases in long-term and intermediate interest rates," said Angelo R. Mozilo, a California mortgage banker and outgoing president of the bankers association.</br></br>Sounding some Bush administration themes, Mozilo said he fears "we will have interest rates back in double digits, which will make it impossible to refinance and difficult to purchase" homes.
NEW YORK, Oct. 21 (AP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market, showing little response to government figures indicating a slowing of the inflation rate, lapsed into a decline today in selling aimed particularly at glamor issues.</br></br>The Dow Jones averagfe of 30 industrial stocks, which had gained 18.95 points in I lie last four sessions, fell back 9.97 to 944.90.</br></br>Nationwide' turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, came to 21.37 million shards.</br></br>Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs index of 400 industrials lost 1.18 to' 112.62, and' the S&P 500-stock composite index gave up .97 to 100.77.</br></br>As the market opened, the Labor Department reported that its consumer price index rose 0.4 per cent in September, or the equival-
The income of the average Washington area household, after taxes, remains the highest of any metropolitan area in the country, according to the latest statistics compiled by the marketing research firm Sales & Marketing Management.</br></br>Last year, average local household income was $50,232, 42 percent above the national average of $35,255, according to the firm's annual survey of buying power. Washington also is about 8 percent higher than second-ranked San Francisco-Oakland, where the average after-tax household income totaled $46,383 last year. The survey measures the buying power of the top 10 metropolitan areas in the United States.</br></br>The Washington metropolitan area, with a population that approached 3.4 million last year, first gained the rank of the most affluent city in the 1970 census and has since consolidated that position over the past 18 years.</br></br>"Washington, and for that matter, the entire Washington-Baltimore region, has emerged as a real economic powerhouse," said Ray Weiss, deputy director of the Washington-Baltimore Regional Association, a business alliance.</br></br>Not only do households in the area earn more money than their counterparts in other cities, they also spend a great deal of it.
The federal budget deficit will plummet this year to $116 billion, according to a revised Congressional Budget Office forecast issued yesterday, marking the fourth consecutive year of declining deficits and the smallest annual revenue shortfall since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981.</br></br>CBO's new estimate is virtually the same as one released late last month by the White House Office of Management and Budget and provides the Clinton administration with additional election-year grist for asserting that its anti-deficit and economic policies are working.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½Ûªs good news for the country, and it shows how important it is that we continue to use conservative economic assumptions and have all new [tax cut and spending] proposals paid for with specific savings,ï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûª said Gene Sperling, a White House economics adviser. In an indirect shot at Republican presidential nominee Robert J. Doleï¿½Ûªs call for a 15-percent reduction in personal income tax rates, Sperling added that "itï¿½Ûªs also important that we not return to the supply-side wishful thinking that led to deficits escalating in the 1980s.ï¿½Û</br></br>The deficit, which ballooned in the 1980s and early 1990s, gradually began to decline during President Clinton's administration, from $255 billion in 1993 to $203 billion in 1994 to $164 billion in 1995. As recently as three months ago, the CBO, Congressï¿½Ûªs official budget</br></br>But the combination of an improving economy and declining unemployment produced an unanticipated $22 billion revenue surge and a dramatic improvement in the deficit picture, analysts said. At the same time, projected government spending for the year is down by $7 billion from previous CBO estimates.
LONDON -- European shares surged Thursday, as investors were heartened by a continued retreat in oil prices and strong earnings from mobile-phone giant Nokia.</br></br>Beaten-down financial stocks jumped on better-than-expected results from U.S. banks.</br></br>The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index jumped 2.9% to 276.27, its biggest one-day gain since April 1.</br></br>Lower oil prices also helped boost stocks in Asia, as did buying in financial stocks.</br></br>"The rebound is not fundamentally driven. The markets will perhaps stabilize in the short term, but when you consider that nothing has changed, markets could head lower after a short gap," said Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities in Hong Kong.
NEW YORK, June 15-Specula-tors gave the dollarï¿½Ûªs rally a fresh push today in advance of a report Thursday on the U.S. trade deficit.</br></br>The rally gained strength late in the day after wavering in trading abroad. The U.S. currency soared past 2.03 West German marks despite attempts by the Federal Reserve to keep it below that level by selling dollars.</br></br>"To be short dollars these days is like committing suicide,ï¿½Û said Gary Lutnick, a currency trader at Banco di Sicilia in New York.</br></br>Since the end of April the dollar has risen 13 percent against the Japanese yen, 8 percent against the West German mark and 11 percent against the British pound.</br></br>The strong dollar increases the spending power of Americansï¿½Ûª money but could hurt the economy in the long run by making U.S.-made goods more expensive in world markets, worsening the trade deficit.

Stock prices soared on news of the five-nation program to reduce the value of the dollar against major foreign currencies.</br></br>Many stocks opened sharply higher and held much of those early gains throughout the session. Some issues even advanced a bit more just before the closing bell.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped more than 15 points in the first 15 minutes of trading. Traders in New York said much of the initial demand seemed to come from European investors and from professional traders buying back stocks they previously had sold short in anticipation of price declines. The industrial index ended 18.37 points higher at 1316.31, the best one-day advance since late May.</br></br>The broader market barometers also rose impressively. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 2.25 to 184.30, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 1.12 to 106.51. Gainers far outnumbered losers on the Big Board, 1,074 to 491.</br></br>The Dow Jones Transportation Average gained 8.67 to 658.01, but the utility index lagged, closing up 0.72 at 153.52.
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday said that he believes the current pause in the economic expansion likely is temporary and that the Fed will supply enough money and credit to keep the economy growing "in an orderly way.ï¿½Û</br></br>Volcker, in his first speech since well before the election, told a New York audience, "A sharp slowing in growth for a time during an expansion period is in fact historically common, typically related to temporary imbalances in inventories following a period of rapid accumulation and temporary fluctuations in consumption. Something of that sort seems to be at work this fall.</br></br>"Continuing growth in income and employment and relatively strong investment plans are reassuring signs for the future,ï¿½Û the Fed chairman said. "The decided decline in interest rates as the growth rate has slowed should help support both housing and investment, and the related easing of pressures on bank reserve positions by the Federal</br></br>Most short-term market interest rates have dropped more than 2 full percentage points since the first of September.

NEW YORK -- The dollar advanced against the yen and the euro Friday in New York, reversing overnight losses to exit from active trading little changed from day-earlier levels.</br></br>Most of the gains were attributable to profit-taking after the dollar's five-session slide, traders said. Ever since the release of the dismal U.S. employment report for August on Sept. 7, the dollar had been on the decline. It hit a series of all-time intradays lows against the euro, as well as 30-year lows against the Canadian dollar, during the week.</br></br>Investors jockeyed for position Friday ahead of the weekend and a decision Tuesday by the Federal Reserve on U.S. interest rates, resulting in a moderate upswing for the greenback versus the yen and euro during the morning in New York.</br></br>Late afternoon Friday in New York, the euro was at $1.3878 from $1.3886 late Thursday, while the dollar was at 115.30 yen from 115.25 yen. Also, the euro was at 159.78 yen from 160.04 yen. The British pound was at $2.0068 from $2.0303 late Thursday. The dollar was quoted at 1.1889 Swiss francs from 1.1868 Swiss francs late Thursday.</br></br>Some of the intraday dollar strength seen Friday was "a secondary effect of risk reduction," said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets.
WASHINGTON -- The General Accounting Office estimates that the Pentagon netted a windfall of $35 billion in fiscal 1982 through 1985 by using excessive inflation projections in budget planning.</br></br>The surplus, which is higher than most earlier estimates, occurred because the annual inflation rates were lower than government economists projected in those years. According to a GAO study, the Pentagon redirected most of the funds to weapons programs and personnel pay raises. The study, requested by Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) of the House Armed Services committee, calls for steps to ensure that the Defense Department doesn't receive excessive funds to cover inflation in the future.</br></br>The report, which the GAO is expected to release later this month after the Pentagon has submitted its comments, is likely to rekindle a debate over the defense budgeting process. Congressional staffers say some of the recommendations may lead to proposals to give lawmakers greater control over the Pentagon's inflation-accounting system. Congress is scheduled to take up the military appropriations bill for fiscal 1986, which begins Oct. 1, in the next few weeks.</br></br>The GAO report challenges a central premise underlying the Pentagon's system of budgeting for inflation: that weapons budgets should be based on separate, higher inflation assumptions than those for the rest of the federal budget. Since 1982, the Pentagon has based its requests for funds on the assumption that weapons prices would increase at a rate 30% higher than the inflation rate the government used in calculating the real gross national product, the inflation-adjusted value of the nation's output of goods and services.</br></br>However, the GAO analysis concludes that defense procurements "increased at about the same rate as prices of all goods in the U.S. economy."
The oils resumed their leadership early in the session. Their gains were hacked in mid-session. Towards the close, however, some of them found renewed strength.</br></br>Aircrafts were lower in the fore part of ï¿½Û¢ the session. A sudden flurry pushed them up late in the day. But their gains evaporated by the close.</br></br>Some of the rails spurted ahead by noon on word that the Interstate Commerce Commission had permitted the carriers a 33 per cent hike in their demurrage charges to alleviate the shortage of freight cars. These charges are made against shippers who keep the cars longer than the two days of free time allotted for unloading. But the rails, already lower because of the industryï¿½Ûªs drop in net income for April, failed to keep their, gains and declined on average.</br></br>The net result of all this was a set of con- ; tradictory market statistics, with the key stocks ahead on average but slightly more losers than gainers among all listed issues.</br></br>The Assoeaited Press average of. 60 stocks rose 30 cents to $184.00 with the industrials up $1.00, the rails down 20 cents and the j utilities down 20 cents.
TORONTO--The Canadian dollar was little moved Thursday, as investors grappled for clarity on the status of negotiations to avert the so-called U.S. fiscal cliff.</br></br>U.S. lawmakers were offering distinctly different views how budget talks were going. House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio) said no "substantive progress" had been made, while Democrats said a deal could be reached before Christmas.</br></br>The U.S. dollar was at C$0.9930 late Thursday, from C$0.9921 late Wednesday, according to data provider CQG.</br></br>Investors worry that Congress won't be able to reach a budget deal to avoid the U.S. fiscal cliff, and that the series of tax increases and spending cuts slated to take effect on Jan. 1 will send the U.S. economy back into recession.</br></br>In economic data, the U.S. economy expanded at its fastest pace in nearly three years in the third quarter, but analysts voiced concerns about the details of that report. U.S. pending home sales were much stronger than expected, and the weekly number of new jobless claims decreased slightly more than expected.
Fifty years ago Wednesday, a 25-year-old woman was awakened in a hunting lodge -- a posh treehouse, actually -- in Kenya and told that her father had died. Therefore she was immediately Elizabeth II, sovereign.</br></br>Tony Blair, the 10th prime minister of Elizabeth II's reign, was not yet born when she ascended to the throne. Winston Churchill was then the first among her ministers. How much has changed since her June 1953 coronation? The decision to televise it was deeply controversial. Most television sets were in pubs, where, it was feared, decorum among the lower orders might lapse during the ceremony.</br></br>Since then, the House of Windsor, including some of its much-too- merry wives, has often resembled a soap opera. But, then, sovereignty has never been a shield from life's vicissitudes: The longest- surviving child of Queen Anne's (1702-14) 18 pregnancies died at age 11.</br></br>Elizabeth II's coronation coincided with Edmund Hillary's conquest of Everest (and, almost as inspiriting, with the end of tea rationing, a relic of the war), which stirred hopes of a "New Elizabethan Age." Instead, there was the continuing loss of empire, a diminishing world role, watery socialism and worsening economic anemia. By the mid-1970s Britain was reduced to the status of the sick man of Europe. Then came revival, but the woman who authored it was named not Elizabeth but Margaret -- Thatcher.</br></br>Once upon a time, in mankind's political immaturity, monarchy was the best available answer to the problems of sovereignty and succession as nation-states evolved. And being a monarch was risky. Richard III (1483-85) was the last English king to die in battle and George II (1727-60) was the last to fight alongside British troops.
WASHINGTON -- In an unusual show of official opposition, the heads of three government agencies have lined up against a proposed Securities and Exchange Commission rule that would prohibit the popular takeover-related tactic called "sweeping the Street."</br></br>The proposed rule would bar corporate raiders from jumping into the stock market during or just after a tender offer and rapidly buying big chunks of a target company's stock. Comments opposing the rule were filed with the SEC by Beryl Sprinkel, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers; James C. Miller III, the director of the Office of Management and Budget; and Charles Rule, the chief of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division.</br></br>Without necessarily endorsing the proposed rule, the commissioners voted 4-1 in September to sound out public response to it. Commissioner Charles Cox, who cast the sole opposing vote, said yesterday that he found it "significant" that the chiefs of three government offices dislike the rule, in that they don't comment often on rule proposals." Mr. Cox, who has been at the SEC five years, said he doesn't recall any previous instance of three government agencies lining up against a proposed SEC rule.</br></br>The proposed rule would, with certain exceptions, prohibit large open market or privately negotiated transactions that increase the holdings of the initial bidder or any other purchaser by 10% or more, either during the course of a formal tender offer or for 10 business days after the offer's expiration date. In addition, a bidder who announces takeover intentions but doesn't follow through with a formal offer would be required to wait 30 days before making open-market purchases.</br></br>The three letters of opposition make similar arguments along free-market lines. In his letter, Mr. Rule contended that, "There is . . . no evidence that shareholders are generally injured by market sweeps." Mr. Miller maintained that the rule would extend tender offer regulation to legitimate open market purchases, and in doing so impose new costs on the tender offer process. Finally, Mr. Sprinkel said, "The proposed rules appear to tip toward the interests of incumbent management."
Sens. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) yesterday released a preliminary study of the Federal Reserve by the General Accounting Office that urged a variety of changes at the central bank, including consideration of merging some of its 12 regional banks.</br></br>The senators criticized a steady increase in Fed operating costs and the number of its employees as well as existence of "surplus" accounts at the regional banks that total $3.7 billion. The money should be turned over to the Treasury, they said. However, a summary of the GAO report said that the existence of the accounts holding $3.7 billion did not raise the cost of Fed operations as far as taxpayers were concerned.</br></br>The regional Fed banks set aside this money as a form of protection against losses on credit that they extend to financial institutions in connection with operation of the Fed's electronic funds transfer network and for direct loans.</br></br>The senators said the Fed has not lost money in its dealings with banks and therefore needs no such cash cushion.</br></br>The GAO report said that if some of the "surplus" money was turned over to the Treasury, it would reduce the size of the federal budget deficit for that year, but that under Congressional Budget Office rules, it could not be counted as a savings that would allow the money to be spent for some other purpose.
Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Arthur F. Burns accepted yesterday a $50,000 post at the American Enterprise Institute as a full-time distinguished scholar in residence. He also will teach an undergraduate seminar at Georgetown University this fall, where he will have the title of distinguished professorial' lecturer.</br></br>Burns chose the post with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, it was learned, over an offer from the Brookings Institution, another research organization in Washington generally considered to have a liberal orientation. He will have a staff of assistants, AEI said, and fï¿½ï¿½e free to pursue subjects of his own choice.</br></br>Burns is known to have received numerous offers from universities, ousi-ness corporations and publications to teach, advise or write. Both he and Mrs. Burns were anxious to remain in Washington.</br></br>AEI officials said that Burns would hold a press conference Monday morning to discuss his new role, and to comment on the current economic situation.</br></br>In his final public statements before leaving the Fed, Burns had urged President Carter to be more forceful in protecting the value of the dollar.
WASHINGTON -- The outlook for low inflation goes beyond the latest consumer price report, and the reason is wages.</br></br>The growth in labor costs is definitely slowing. When the recession started in July 1990, hourly earnings were running 4% above the year before. Now, hourly pay is only 2.5% above year-earlier levels. For the full year, analysts widely predict that labor costs will rise less than the 4.4% increase of 1991.</br></br>Many inflation optimists peg their good mood on wage costs. "With nominal wage increases gradually easing . . . the odds of seeing a further gradual reduction in the core rate of inflation are quite favorable," says Federal Reserve Board Gov. Susan Phillips.</br></br>A recent survey of economists by Blue Chip Economic Indicators found nearly 60% cite modest increases in wage and benefit costs as a key reason prices are likely to remain subdued through 1993.</br></br>Joe Elling, a senior economist with Weyerhaeuser Co., a supplier to the construction industry, says, "Labor costs are going to remain slow, especially in the construction industry, for at least a few more years. We don't even talk about inflation."
Here's how some major bills fared recently in Congress and how local congressional members voted, as provided by Thomas Voting Reports. The District's congressional delegate is not permitted to vote on final passage of legislation. "NV" means "not voting."</br></br>The House of Representatives voted to join the Senate in blocking a congressional pay raise set for January 2011. The bill (HR 5146) will freeze salaries at levels in effect since January 2009, which are $174,000 for rank-and-file members, $193,400 for the House and Senate majority and minority leaders and the Senate president pro tempore, and $223,500 for the House speaker. Under federal law, lawmakers automatically receive cost-of-living increases each January unless they vote to block them.</br></br>Other top federal salaries are $400,000 for the president, $230,700 for the vice president, $223,500 for the chief justice of the United States, $213,900 for associate Supreme Court justices, $199,700 for Cabinet officers, $184,500 for appellate judges and $174,00 for district judges. When Congress freezes its own pay, it usually follows up by freezing other top salaries as well.</br></br>The House passed a bill (HR 2499) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a plebiscite on whether it wishes to remain a U.S. territory or seek independence or statehood. If the mandate is for change, a second vote would be held to determine the new status. However, only Congress could grant statehood. Although Puerto Rico's 4.1 million residents are U.S. citizens, they lack voting representation in Congress and cannot vote in presidential elections, among other exceptions to full citizenship.</br></br>The House refused to stipulate English as Puerto Rico's official language if it were to choose statehood under HR 2499 (above). The motion also sought to affirm residents' Second Amendment right to bear arms if Puerto Rico becomes a state.
NEW YORK, March 21 wnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market was depressed today by profit-taking in the recently strong blue chips.</br></br>The general decline took prices down 1 to around 3 points. There werenï¿½Ûªt many good gainers. Most sizable rises were accounted for by corporate news or Wall Street rumors.</br></br>The market started lower and continued down throughout the session. Steels, coppers and aircrafts faced early selling which eventually took in just about every segment of the list.</br></br>Near the close, the railroads tried for a rally based on some excellent earnings reports for individual roads. The move didnï¿½Ûªt get very far, but the rails as a group-were down only a shade.</br></br>The market has been making one new record high after another, and today's backward step was looked upon as a natural breather in the climb upward.
NEW YORK -- In the end, it was the dollar that suffered most from the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain a neutral stance toward further fiscal tightening, despite climbing against the yen.</br></br>U.S. stocks and bonds rallied on the news. Emerging markets and their currencies soared. Commodity-linked currencies jumped, while the Swiss franc, sterling and the euro sprang to their highest levels of the day against the dollar.</br></br>The Fed's 0.25-percentage-point increase of its key lending rate to 5% from 4.75% was expected. But its adoption of a neutral bias wasn't -- at least not in currency markets.</br></br>Thus the dollar, positioned for the rewards it would reap from an interest-rate differential widened by a series of rate hikes, was sold off against most currencies.</br></br>Against the yen, however, the dollar was playing by a different set of rules.
NEW YORK -- Prices of Treasury bonds slumped yesterday as dealers and investors were shaken by a sharp drop in the U.S. dollar's value against other major currencies.</br></br>Some actively traded U.S. government bonds fell more than half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face amount. Interest rates declined at the weekly auction of Treasury bills, but most other short-term rates rose.</br></br>Adding to investor jitters was a rise in the price of oil. Prices of gold and other precious metals viewed as harbingers of inflation also rose.</br></br>"Investors are growing increasingly concerned that the dollar's weakness could make foreigners reluctant to buy dollar-denominated securities," said Maury N. Harris, chief economist at PaineWebber Inc. Foreign investors have purchased large amounts of Treasury bonds in recent years, helping the U.S. government finance its huge budget deficits.</br></br>Furthermore, a continued drop in the dollar might rekindle inflationary pressures and cause the Federal Reserve not to ease credit, some investment managers say. Analysts generally have been expecting the Fed to drive interest rates lower to try to to stimulate economic growth.
WASHINGTON -- The Clinton administration unveiled its plan to stanch the global economic crisis, including a new preapproved credit line for countries that fall victim to investor panic despite sound economic policies.</br></br>With financial chaos rolling over East Asia and Russia, and threatening Brazil as well, the U.S. put forth a wish list that sharpens some old tools and offers some new initiatives, but adds no new money to the international response to the crisis beyond already-requested funding.</br></br>The key element is the new preapproved contingency fund under the International Monetary Fund, a proposal that finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven major industrialized nations agreed to "explore" at their meeting Saturday night. The G-7 gave a warmer endorsement to U.S. calls for more multilateral lending to battle poverty and fix troubled banking systems, as well as a U.S. plan to use multilateral guarantees to encourage private investors to put their money back into emerging markets.</br></br>The IMF proposal, however, is likely to prove the most controversial element of the U.S. initiative.</br></br>While other IMF loans require borrowing countries to agree to implement often-austere economic policies before they get loans, this new approach would be for countries whose policies the IMF judges to be sound already. But the idea appears to challenge the IMF's traditional insistence on strict conditions on its loans; without such conditions, the IMF and others have argued, IMF money may be wasted.
The struggling housing market appears as if it will sustain less damage than expected this year from a spike in the monthly payments on hundreds of thousands of exotic adjustable-rate mortgages.</br></br>The number of such loans scheduled to adjust to higher payments this year has shrunk. Lower-than-expected interest rates, coupled with efforts to aggressively modify loans, are likely to mute payment shocks for some borrowers. Many others already have defaulted on their loans even before their payments adjusted upward.</br></br>"The peaks of the reset wave are melting very quickly because the delinquency and foreclosure rates on these are loans are already very high," says Sam Khater, senior economist at First American CoreLogic.</br></br>The housing market still faces enormous challenges, and a full recovery is likely to take years. The threat posed by resetting payments, Mr. Khater says, is "a drop in the bucket" compared to problems posed by the sheer volume of borrowers who owe more than their homes are worth, known as being "under water."</br></br>Still, for years, housing analysts have worried about the threat of an aftershock from a big spike in mortgage defaults from so-called option adjustable-rate mortgages, which require low minimum payments before resetting to sharply higher levels, and "interest-only" loans, for which no principal payments are due for several years.
America is planning to go protectionist this year, assuaging its conscience and better sense of judgment by calling it something else.</br></br>Trade legislation will pass, and it will be described as nonprotectionist, a "program of action." It will go under the rubric of boosting "competitiveness"-as if the old Yankee trader spirit can be revived by legislative fiat. And some will be comforted by the thought that it could have been worse.</br></br>A new trade bill sponsored by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the Finance Committee, and Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.)-with wide bipartisan endorsement-has already been inferentially blessed by a senior Reagan administration official as "less offensive" than last year's punitive quota legislation.</br></br>As former Council of Economic Advisers chairman Charles L. Schultze pointed out in a piece for the Los Angeles Times, concentrating on "competitiveness" is better than concentrating on raw protectionism. Those who are pushing the competitiveness theme lump together, with plain old protectionist nostrums, a number of laudable goals, such as remedial education and more spending for research and development. The bitter is coated with the sweet to make it more palatable politically.</br></br>The problem with competitiveness, as a disguise for protectionism, is that it is a phony solution to the problem of America's $170 billion trade deficit. The underlying assumption is that we've run up that much red ink because we can't compete with other countries that don't play by fair trading rules.
NEW YORK -- A surge in demand for marks and a falling U.S. stock market sent the dollar into a sharp decline against the German currency and the yen yesterday, traders said.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell just over 160 points -- its third fall in a row. The U.S. bond market also was in the doldrums.</br></br>The mark's advance was most prominent against the lira, Sweden's krona and Spain's peseta. Traders said the sense -- mainly a delayed reaction to a Dutch interest-rate rise Friday -- that German official rates have bottomed out sent investors fleeing from currencies of European countries with higher interest rates.</br></br>"The perception in the market is that German rates have hit bottom," said Kevin Lawrie, chief dealer at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "That takes away the attractiveness of other high-yielding currencies," he added.</br></br>Some market participants also said comments by Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, or EMI, supported the mark. The EMI is the precursor to the future European central bank.
Who's afraid of Saddam Hussein?</br></br>The stock market was, in 1990. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and concern about the Iraqi leader's unpredictable behavior, helped spark a 21% decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</br></br>The Saddam Hussein bear market began six years ago this month. Although unusually swift, the decline met the classic definition of a bear market: a 20% decline in major stock indexes.</br></br>The average had been knocking on the door of the 3000 mark that summer. It stopped a fraction of a point away, with twin peaks of 2999.75 on July 16 and July 17. Then, prices began to slide, ending with an Oct. 11 low of 2365.10.</br></br>Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, and much of the damage in the stock market took place in mid-August, after President Bush had said the invasion "cannot stand," but before it was clear what America would do. Fear that the U.S. might get involved in a prolonged war, or that Mr. Hussein might deploy chemical or biological weapons, helped to spook stocks. As it turned out, the war was quick and resulted in an overwhelming U.S. victory. On Jan. 17, 1991, after hostilities actually began and the results looked good for U.S. forces, the Dow industrials soared 114 points.
The Pentagon said the costs for 36 big weapons systems -- including marquee warplane, submarine and ground-vehicle programs -- have jumped by at least 30% and some by more than 50%, but officials attributed the growth in cost to new reporting rules, not mismanagement.</br></br>A report released Friday was the first review of major weapons programs since Congress tightened terms for calculating cost increases. The new law requires the Pentagon to compare current unit prices with original cost estimates, in addition to more recent revised projections. The Pentagon found that 25 programs had grown by at least 50% over original costs, while 11 programs were between 30% and 50% more expensive.</br></br>"It's not fair to say that this reflects on how we are doing in the past few years, given the broad time span" under consideration, said Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon spokeswoman.</br></br>For example, the prices of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-22 stealth fighter and Boeing Co.'s C-17 cargo jet rose more than 50%, but their original baseline costs were set years ago. The majority of affected programs date from the 1980s and 1990s, Pentagon officials said.</br></br>Legislators say the new law brings transparency to congressional oversight of the Pentagon. Defense contractors complain it fails to take into account inflation or technological and program changes that inevitably occur in long-term weapons development. Even younger programs, such as Boeing's $165-billion Future Combat Systems modernization project for the Army and Northrop Grumman Corp.'s Global Hawk unmanned spy plane, surpassed the law's 50% cost-growth threshold because of program restructurings and delays.
Howard L. Yudkin, 52, president and chief executive officer of the Software Productivity Consortium in Herndon since 1986 and a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for telecommunications, died May 23 of a heart ailment at Shady Grove Adventist Hospital in Rockville.</br></br>Dr. Yudkin joined the Department of Defense in 1970 as an assistant director of defense research and engineering. He left in 1974 and joined Computer Sciences Corp. in Falls Church, where he was president of the firm's systems division.</br></br>He went to work for Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc., a Bethesda consulting firm, in 1982, and was a vice president there until he joined the Software Productivity Consortium.</br></br>Dr. Yudkin, who lived in Rockville, was a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania in his native Philadelphia. He received master's and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was an electrical engineer in MIT's Lincoln Laboratory until he came to the Washington area in 1970.</br></br>Survivors include his wife of 29 years, Judith Sussman Yudkin of Rockville; two daughers, Laurie Yudkin of Revere, Mass., and Debra Yudkin of Westwood Village, Calif.; his mother, Jeanne Yudkin of Philadelphia, and a sister, Sandra Casway of Columbia, Md.
Despite growing ranks of those who doubt that the bull market will enjoy a second phase, some investment officers still are counting on an upturn, at least for some sectors of the market.</br></br>For most investors, "the pendulum has swung to pessimism" because they think the economic recovery is more robust than had been expected, says Donald E. Carver, vice president of First Pennsylvania Corp., Philadelphia. They see exceptionally strong public and private credit demand and they fear the current economic strength will prompt the Federal Reserve "to adopt a more restrictive credit policy that could abort the economic recovery," he asserts.</br></br>Other negative factors, he adds, include reduced contributions to corporate pension funds and fewer stock purchases by foreigners.</br></br>However, Mr. Carver believes these negatives are outweighed by positive developments. "Although inflation is rising, it's still moderate, and commodity prices are weak," he contends. "Federal expenditures are running well below budgeted levels and the deficit for the current fiscal year won't be as bad as had been feared." He notes that with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 15% from its record high last November, it is now at book value.</br></br>In addition, Mr. Carver says that "less stock is available because over $40 billion in takeovers and stock repurchase programs has shrunk the supply."

Rockefeller criticized the panic sellers. He and his son, he said, were buying, because ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½there is nothing in the business situation to warrant the destruction of stock values that has taken place.ï¿½Û</br></br>He was wrong that time, because the nationï¿½Ûªs economy was in serious trouble even before the stock prices collapsed. But on other occasions in the past half-century he would have been right to ignore the signals from Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most common measure of stock market performance, has proved to be an erratic barometer of the economic weather.</br></br>According to economists and business historians, sharp fluctuations in stock prices do not necessarily presage similar movements in the performance of the economy, and the stock market has lagged behind economic trends as often as it has forecast them.

Interest-rate jitters and profit-taking dragged stocks in Asia and Europe lower as investors awaited the outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy committee meeting.</br></br>While the Fed decided to leave U.S. short-term rates unchanged yesterday afternoon, the news came too late to revive wilting stocks in Asia and Europe. And investors still are waiting to see whether the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, both of which meet today, will lower European and British interest rates. German stocks fell 1.5%, France fell 1.3%, Italy shed 1%, and Britain dropped 1.2%.</br></br>Meanwhile in Asia, the focus was on Japan, where government bond yields continued to climb. This boosted the yen, and hurt Japanese stocks, which fell 1.3%. The key index in Hong Kong fell 0.9%, South Korea dropped 2.5% and Thailand shed 2.6%.</br></br>Overall, the Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.32 point, or 0.16%, to 205.77.</br></br>In trading in Asia Thursday, Tokyo closed the morning session down 1.6%, while South Korea was 1.4% lower in late-morning dealings. Hong Kong had shed 0.5% in early trading.
Soaring computer-networking and Internet stocks pushed the Nasdaq Composite Index to its ninth consecutive record, but blue-chip stocks slipped amid worries about Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony, which starts today.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had hit its latest record on Friday, declined 42.22, or 0.45%, to 9295.75. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.65, or 0.22%, from Friday's record to 1184.10 in quiet trading. The Nasdaq composite, however, rose 5.49, or 0.27%, to 2014.25 on gains by companies such as Yahoo! and Cisco Systems, even though Microsoft, Intel and Dell Computer fell.</br></br>Bonds gained; the dollar was mixed.</br></br>Many investors hope the Fed chairman today and tomorrow will hint that he is pulling back to a neutral position on interest rates, softening the Fed's current bias toward raising rates. Some economists even think that, with economic growth apparently slowing, the Fed could cut rates later this year, helping stocks and bonds. The 30-year Treasury bond gained 17/32, or $5.31 per $1,000 bond, cutting the yield to 5.707%.</br></br>Bullish comments from two prominent Wall Street investment strategists didn't overcome sour news from several fronts. McDonald's warned of a difficult second half, while union members at General Motors' Saturn unit voted to strike, and soft oil prices hurt Exxon.
Author: Abhrajit Gangopadhyay</br></br>NEW DELHI -- India's food inflation rate turned up a tad in the week ended Nov. 27, but stayed below double digits, easing immediate pressure on the central bank to tighten monetary policy further though rising global commodity prices are a concern.</br></br>The food inflation rate, based on the wholesale price index, rose 8.69% from a year earlier, compared with 8.60% in the week through Nov. 20 as egg, meat, fish and onion became costlier, according to data issued Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.</br></br>Food inflation is the primary culprit driving up overall prices in Asia's third-largest economy, but as summer-sown crops enter the market, boosting staple supplies, the number is showing signs of easing. Last week, the food price inflation eased to the single digit for the first time since May 2009.</br></br>However, that doesn't offer much peace to the central bank that is cautiously watching rising global commodity prices, which could be the next trigger to drive India's inflation.

It's better to build than to buy.</br></br>That is the current mantra of online brokerage firms, whose ranks have ballooned in recent years and now number about 140. But with prices and activity on the Nasdaq Stock Market -- playground of online traders -- swooning since March, a shakeout among online brokers seems inevitable.</br></br>"This industry is absolutely ripe for consolidation," says Henry McVey, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. "You've got a glut of capacity out there."</br></br>Yes, yes. But not so fast.</br></br>What's holding things up is a little-known fact: It remains far cheaper for online brokers to acquire new accounts through massive ad spending than to gobble up smaller rivals.
Virginia Gov. Timothy M. Kaine (D) has recommended changes to legislation passed by the General Assembly that environmentalists had feared would cripple a popular land conservation program.</br></br>The bill was part of a compromise between the House of Delegates and the Senate, which concluded months of feuding and passed a state budget last month. As passed by the General Assembly, the measure repealed Virginia's estate tax and paid for the tax break by imposing a cap of $50 million in 2007 and $75 million in 2008 on tax credits given to landowners who agreed to preserve open space.</br></br>Senators had argued that the popular tax credit program needed the caps because it was costing the state many millions more than predicted. House leaders and conservationists countered that the program's popularity was proof that it was helping Virginia to save acreage from development.</br></br>The amendments would impose a $100 million cap and allow the cap to rise over time with inflation. Kaine also would remove a provision to give preferential treatment to landowners in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.</br></br>Christopher G. Miller, president of the Piedmont Environmental Council, called the governor's amendments "a substantial improvement."
The Federal Reserve stood pat on interest rates Wednesday, but it was hardly out of complacency.</br></br>Caught between heightened inflation fears and persistent concerns about a sluggish economy, Ben Bernanke and his fellow policy makers decided to leave the Fed's key short-term interest rate unchanged at 2%. The non-move marked the end of a series of rate cuts dating back to last summer, when credit woes were creeping up on the economy. The latest vote was 9-1, with Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, once again dissenting, this time opting for a rate increase. And, indeed, recent comments from Fed personages -- including Wednesday's commentary -- suggest the bank's next rate move will be upward. "Although downside risks to growth remain, they appear to have diminished somewhat, and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased," the Fed said in its statement. The bank is in a bit of a pickle. Reporter Sudeep Reddy writes that Fed officials are trying to avoid rate increases for now to avoid exacerbating the weakness in employment, financial markets and the housing sector. At the same time, they are trying to signal they're serious about fighting inflation by talking about the risks of rising inflation expectations and suggesting a willingness to act quickly if inflation expectations get out of hand. Assuming commodity prices don't go completely haywire, some economists think that won't happen, as the weakening economy, particularly the rising unemployment rate, restrain wages and a willingness to spend. Indeed, Joseph Brusuelas of Merk Investments thinks a rate increase won't be happening anytime soon. "We anticipate that the rate hike currently priced in [by markets] for September will wither away in the heat of the summer slowdown in the economy," he said. Likewise, PNC economist Stuart Hoffman, while now more convinced that the Fed's next move will be an increase, sees the federal-funds rate holding at 2% until "late 2008 or early 2009."</br></br>---</br></br>Stocks Inch Up</br></br>The Federal Reserve's announcement gave the Dow Jones Industrial Average a quick boost, but in the end the blue-chip gauge was ahead only 4.40 points, or 0.04%, at 11811.83. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.6%, or 7.68, to 1321.97 and the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.4%, or 32.98, to 2401.26. Crude-oil futures fell $2.45, or 1.8%, to $134.55 a barrel in New York. The dollar weakened against other major currencies.
The former head trader at a hedge-fund giant settled regulatory allegations that he systematically attempted to manipulate prices of platinum and palladium, a sign that commodities regulators are intensifying efforts to crack down on manipulation in the futures markets.</br></br>Christopher Pia--former head trader at hedge fund Moore Capital and a major player at the fund for 18 years--agreed to pay $1 million to settle civil allegations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the regulator said in a release Monday. The CFTC alleged that he tried to artificially move futures prices near the very end of daily trading in a maneuver called "banging the close," which involves inundating the market with trading orders. The $1 million penalty is one of the largest ever levied by the CFTC against an individual.</br></br>The settlement comes amid a boom in which the prices of metals and other commodities have skyrocketed, raising concerns at the CFTC about possible manipulation and abusive practices. One way investors bet on commodities is through the futures market, where they enter into contracts to buy or sell raw materials at a set price on a specified date. The CFTC now has a broader mandate and new tools to attack violations in the commodities markets.</br></br>Under the CFTC settlement, the 45-year-old Mr. Pia, once one of the most powerful traders on Wall Street, also agreed to a permanent ban in trading CFTC-regulated products in platinum and palladium, such as futures contracts. He also is banned from trading instruments regulated by the CFTC during the closing period, the final few minutes of trading when settlement prices are determined. Mr. Pia hasn't traded in the contracts involved in the settlement since May 2008, according to a person close to the situation.</br></br>A lawyer for Mr. Pia declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Pia said Mr. Pia "is pleased to have settled with the CFTC in order to put this matter behind him. Pia Capital, his current firm, is committed to abiding by the CFTC Order and to maintaining the highest level of compliance." He settled without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Euro-zone officials seemed to score a victory at the weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations, securing a warning against volatile currency moves.</br></br>That is, until financial markets second-guessed them yesterday, giving the nod to the U.S., whose bond market and economy continue to reap the rewards of a weak dollar.</br></br>By continuing to exert downward pressure on the U.S. currency, investors ensure that foreign central banks will remain heavy buyers of U.S. Treasurys. The U.S. benefits, as a soaring budget deficit stimulates growth, a weak currency spurs exports, and low yields encourage consumer demand.</br></br>"The U.S. is definitely winning -- no doubt about it," said Richard Gilhooly, senior bond strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.
Wilder used his State of the Commonwealth address to announce the end of his presidential campaign, saying he would devote himself to Virginiaï¿½Ûªs problems.</br></br>RICHMOND, Jan. 9ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Gov. L. Douglas Wilder seldom admits making a mistake, but today he said "obviously I was wrongï¿½Û in thinking he could , run for president and manage the nationï¿½Ûªs 12th-largest state, especially during the depths of a recession.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You canï¿½Ûªt do both things well," Wilder said during an impromptu, on-the-move news conference a day after he abandoned his campaign for national office.</br></br>. Wilder insisted his decision was: motivated by a desire to live up to his responsibilities as governor, but some observers said his unexpected . announcement during Wednesday night's State of the Commonwealth address was impelled by the realities of a failed campaign.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He was trying to make a virtue out of a necessity," said Robert Holsworth, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth
Author: Kelly Evans</br></br>Not all real estate is in the dumps.</br></br>Housing data due this week aren't likely to be encouraging. Figures Monday are expected to show sales of existing homes fell nearly 4% in February from January. On Tuesday, the government's index of home prices is forecast to register its seventh drop in eight months. And on Wednesday, economists anticipate new home sales in February will post a monthly increase of about 2% monthly increase, which will do little to dent January's nearly 13% decline.</br></br>Partly because of this, the rental market is heating up. Average U.S. apartment vacancy rates dropped to 6.6% last year from 8%, according to property-research firm Reis, while rents rose 2.3%. This has developers salivating over the potential for a multiyear rental boom. After all, the glut of foreclosed, single-family homes so far isn't proving much competition. Occupied apartments rose by about 58,000 in the fourth quarter, the biggest increase for that period in 10 years, according to Reis.</br></br>It is "very good to be in the apartment business today," David Neithercut, chief executive of Equity Residential, the biggest public U.S. real-estate investment trust, remarked at a recent conference. Population growth, a gradual firming of the labor market and a drop in the U.S. homeownership rate to 65% from its near-70% peak could generate about 4.5 million new renter households over the next five years, according to Greenstreet Advisors.
Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods advanced in June at the fastest pace in 42 months, an 8.8 percent increase that was propelled by heavy demand for commercial aircraft, the government said yesterday.</br></br>The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods-considered to be items that will last at least three years-totaled $125.23 billion last month, $10.14 billion higher than the May total.</br></br>The June increase, which followed a 1.9 percent decline in May, was the biggest advance since an 8.9 percent jump in December 1985. It provided further evidence of the strength in U.S. manufacturing, analysts said.</br></br>"Stripping the fluff away, we are still left with a strong pace of activity in the durable goods sector," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of The Boston Co.</br></br>U.S. manufacturing was in a virtual recession for two years beginning in mid-1984 as the soaring value of the dollar attracted a flood of imports into the country and made American goods uncompetitive on overseas markets.
BEIJING -- China continued its recent record-breaking run of increasing official foreign-exchange reserves, adding another $130.59 billion to its stash in just three months.</br></br>But the unusual multibillion-dollar transactions thought to have fueled the huge increases in those holdings this year show signs of tapering off.</br></br>Separately, China's statistics bureau said the country's economy in 2006 grew at an even faster pace than previously estimated, with gross domestic product expanding 11.1%, up from the initially calculated 10.7%.</br></br>The revision led some economists to predict that China could surpass Germany sooner than expected to become the world's third-largest national economy. The U.S. and Japan are the first- and second-largest national economies.</br></br>China's latest additions to its foreign-reserve holdings -- the world's largest -- brought their total to $1.33 trillion at the end of June, up from $1.2 trillion at the end of March, according to data published yesterday by the country's central bank. The figures highlight the enormous sums of money flowing into China -- and the difficulty in tracing them.
Ecuador's move to devalue its currency for the third time in less than a year will ease pressures on the nation's floundering economy -- though not by much, given the failure of the nation's Congress to pass badly needed tax measures.</br></br>It was this failure last Thursday that precipitated the resignation of respected Finance Minister Fidel Jaramillo and the move by the Central Bank to allow the sucre to float on Friday morning.</br></br>"The president has his hands tied," said an analyst at Multiplica Cia., an economic consulting firm in Quito. "Congress isn't helping him."</br></br>The sucre dropped 3.6% on Friday to an interbank midrate of 7,580 sucres to the U.S. dollar from 7,305 sucres on Thursday. Since the end of 1997, when the sucre was at 4,430 to the dollar, it has lost more than 41% of its value.</br></br>The Central Bank couldn't hold out after losing nearly $300 million of its reserves over the past month as local investors rushed to swap sucres for dollars. Ecuador's economic activity also was being choked by short-term interest rates in the triple digits. The Central Bank sharply boosted the overnight interbank lending rate in January in an attempt to slow the flight of dollars after Brazil floated its currency. Friday the Central Bank lowered the rate to 95% from 140%.
Living costs have been holding steady since early fall but another round of price inflation is just ahead.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Itï¿½Ûªs only a breathing spell,ï¿½Û a top Government economist declares. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½These prices are going to start climbing again.ï¿½Û The Administration predicted in January that living costs would go up slightly more than 2.5 per cent this year, and Government experts now say that their crystal balls still show a 2.5 per cent rise.</br></br>The decline in food prices is expected to give way to a renewed advance very shortly. When the turn-around comes, living costs will resume their upward march.</br></br>There will be some exceptions. New car prices, for example, are likely to edge down until the 1968 models roll off the production lines. Dealers customarily shave their prices as the model year progresses. This yearï¿½Ûªs poor sales performance is encouraging many dealers to give even bigger discounts than they usually do.</br></br>But the word from Detroit is that the 1968 models will cost about $100 more than this yearï¿½Ûªs cars which means that i automobile prices will jump isharply next fall.
Last week we presented the view of a well-known economist who expects interest rates to rise to about 8 percent by midyear. A contrary view is offered by John Paulus, chief economist of Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.</br></br>Paulus has believed that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½once the dollar stabilized in the foreign exchange market, the weak fundamentals in the economy would take over and begin to pull U.S. rates down.ï¿½Û We have had stable exchange rates for the past 4 to 5 weeks and, as if on cue, long Treasury rates declined slightly last week</br></br>The Paulus forecast is for the yield on the long Treasury bond to fall to 6.50 percent by midyear (from the current 7.45 percent) and to stay at that level for the remainder of the year. He expects this to happen because he foresees economic growth, as measured by gross national product, to be 1 percent to 1.5 percent during the first half of 1987, and 2 percent for the entire year. Thatï¿½Ûªs one-half to 1 point below the consensus view. Paulus also sees inflation at 3 percent to 3.5 percent versus the consensus of 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent.</br></br>Paulus points to the slowdown in the price growth in the services sector. Prices and wages have been growing 5 percent to 6 percent a year during the current economic expansion. Wage growth fell to 3 percent in 1986, and it is anticipated that this slowdown will be passed through in the form of slower price growth in the services sector in 1987.</br></br>The next factor has to do with corporate restructuring. In a recent study, Paulus examined the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½competitiveness problemï¿½Û that began in the 1970s as import penetration increased substantially, long before the U.S. dollar strengthened to record levels in the early 1980s. Corporate restructuring refers to such practices as the closing of inefficient plants and the modernizing of others, the granting of wage concessions and the paring of "fatï¿½Û from bloated corporate bureaucracies. Paulus points out that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½an integral role in the overall restructuring process is financial restructuringï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mergers, acquisitions and leveraged buyoutsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which facilitates transfers of ownership and, ultimately, changes in management and work practices."
Further evidence that inflation is dormant emerged yesterday as the government reported a 0.4 percent drop in the producer price index last month, the biggest decline in more than a year.</br></br>The report cheered financial markets, but an early rally in the stock market petered out after the Dow Jones industrial average came within 42 points of breaching the 10,000 level. The average finished the day at 9876.35, down 21.09 points, after several big companies issued disappointing earnings forecasts.</br></br>Bonds rose, with the 30-year Treasury bond gaining $5.53 per $1,000 invested, and its yield falling 0.04 percent to 5.52 percent.</br></br>The fall in the PPI, which measures the prices of finished goods produced at factories, farms and refineries, was mostly from decreases in the volatile food and energy categories. The food index dropped 1.4 percent, because of falling prices for meat and vegetables, and the energy index fell 1 percent mainly because of a steep decline in heating oil prices.</br></br>But even the "core" index, which excludes food and energy, was flat in February, underscoring the remarkable absence of inflationary pressures in the robust U.S. economy.
The Postal Service and Wall Street will remain open on Friday, Dec. 26, despite President Clinton's order giving federal workers the day off.</br></br>There's a longstanding tradition of giving federal workers a four-day weekend when Christmas falls on a Thursday. In 1986, the last time it happened, the Postal Service also continued working.</br></br>Other federal employees may also be required to work for reasons of national security, defense or other public need.</br></br>Banks are likely to be open on Dec. 26 as usual, because the Federal Reserve banks around the country will be open, as will their clearing banks, according to the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. The Federal Reserve Board itself, the policy-making entity in Washington, will be closed, said Joseph Clyne, assistant to the board. Mr. Clyne said the Federal Reserve will be issuing the required weekly condition statement regarding federal reserve banks that day.</br></br>The New York Stock Exchange also will continue with its planned operations that day, closing early at 1 p.m. EST, a spokesman said. The Nasdaq Stock Market, which tends to mirror the schedule of the Big Board, also plans a 1 p.m. closing, as does the American Stock Exchange.
Short-selling activity fell on the Nasdaq Stock Market in late March amid hopes Wall Street's credit crisis is nearing an end.</br></br>For the twice-monthly reporting period ended March 31, the number of short-selling positions not yet closed out at Nasdaq -- called short interest -- fell 1.2% to 9,657,092,223, from 9,778,201,744 shares at midmonth.</br></br>Investors who "short" shares borrow and sell them, betting the price will fall and they will be able to buy the shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. In general, the higher the short interest, the more investors expect a downturn. Downdrafts tend to boost the value of short positions.</br></br>The short ratio, or number of days' average volume represented by short positions outstanding at the exchange, rose to 4.5 from 4.2.</br></br>The Wall Street Journal uses average daily composite volume to calculate short ratios.
With unemployment rising to 10 percent in Europe, economic growth is essential to create jobs there. The factor that will most make it happen is lower interest rates, and that will cause a rally in bonds.</br></br>Europe's currency problem "was never about exchange rates," according to David C. Roche, a Morgan Stanley & Co. global strategist who writes from London, "but about interest rates, growth and jobs.ï¿½Û</br></br>Real interest rates have been extremely high for some time, and have helped crush many of Europeï¿½Ûªs economies. Consequently, the European Community finance ministers on Aug. 1 widened the trading bands for most European currencies. This action allowed those members to ease monetary policy and allow interest rates to fall.</br></br>"As central banks cut rates, so bonds should rally significantly," said Julian Callow of Londonï¿½Ûªs Kleinwort Benson Ltd. However, for various reasons, the central banks have been slow to reduce short-term rates to date.</br></br>The yield on 10-year French government bonds, which easily could double as a proxy for most European bonds, already has declined dramatically this year. Analysts believe the yield has a lot more room to fall over the next six to 12 months.
RICHMONDï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The nationwide recession and the conservative reaction of Virginia Gov, Mills E,. Godwin to it have given' rise to a perplexing question that will figure importantly in this yearï¿½Ûªs legislative sessionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½what is the proper state government role in economic bad times?</br></br>The twd sides of the'question are quickly and clearly defined: the state shotild beef up its spending programs, such as capital construction, to stimulate the economy; the state should retrench and await better times.</br></br>In his message opening the legislature Wednesday, ,Gov. Godwin came down on the side of retrenchment and was promptly criticized by 'several General Assembly members. It thus became evident that the political impact of the recession is beginning to color the thinking of Virginia legislators, all of whom will be up for re-election next November.</br></br>In the days following Gov. Godwinï¿½Ûªs general message of budget cuts and belt-tightening, the governor was accused in a floor speech in the House of Delegates of inaction in the face of rising unemployment, and there was talk of a capital-spending program in the state to bolster the economy.</br></br>The governor also had his supporters; many in bpth houses of the legislature share his conservative economic and political view and said his speech struck the 'proper tone of balance.
Government reports yesterday indicated that the U.S. economy is surging ahead, with the Commerce Department now likely to revise its estimate for growth in the final three months of last year to around 5 percent from 3.8 percent, analysts said.</br></br>Yesterday's reports showed that factory output hit a new peak last month, new claims for unemployment benefits fell early this month and the nation's merchandise trade deficit declined to $7 billion in December rather than rising as expected.</br></br>For all of 1992, exports rose $26.4 billion from 1991, but imports went up a larger $45.4 billion, as the year's deficit rose to $84.3 billion from the previous year's $65.4 billion. It was the first increase since 1987 when the deficit hit a record $152.1 billion.</br></br>The Labor Department also reported that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent last month, the biggest monthly rise in two years. However, experts said the increase did not signal an acceleration of inflation.</br></br>The report on December's trade balance and other recent data on the fourth quarter have been considerably stronger than expected. "What today's data mean is that {gross domestic product} will be revised to well over 5 percent," the financial markets research firm of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J., told its clients.
NEW YORK -- Bond prices slumped yesterday after the government reported an unexpectedly strong 0.9% increase in consumer spending last month.</br></br>The spending surge startled many analysts who had assumed that the economy's apparent sluggishness would prompt the Federal Reserve System to drive interest rates lower soon. Now, some economists say the Fed will conclude that the economy doesn't need any additional stimulus and will leave its credit policy unchanged in coming weeks.</br></br>Some actively traded U.S. Treasury bonds fell about a point, or around $10 for each $1,000 face amount. Nevertheless, prices on these issues still are more than 2 1/2 points higher than they were at the beginning of last week.</br></br>The Fed yesterday afternoon reported another surprisingly large increase in the nation's money supply. But the report didn't have much impact on bond prices because many traders assume that the Fed is paying little or no attention to M1 in setting policy. The M1 measure soared $3.7 billion in the week ended June 9, leaving it far above the Fed's target of 3% to 8% growth this year.</br></br>"The big event of the day was the surprising increase in personal consumption expenditures" last month, said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. The report "totally blew away the notion that the consumer is cutting back and stopping spending."
Author: Ann Zimmerman</br></br>Thanksgiving Day was long considered a commercial-free zone.</br></br>By tradition, it was a time for counting blessings, enjoying family and friends and scouring newspaper circulars for the best predawn retail deals available the following day, known as Black Friday.</br></br>It was very simple. Eat 'til you burst on Thursday; shop 'til you drop on Friday.</br></br>But an increasing number of stores are getting a jump on the Friday shopping hordes by opening on Thanksgiving. Some retailers say they are offering a convenience for shoppers who want to beat the madding crowds.
Congress will appropriate more than $1 trillion this year, and all the Congressional Black Caucus wants is $1.3 billion. But after six months of haggling over the funding for a youth jobs program, the group is running out of time.</br></br>The 42-member CBC has pushed for months for Congress to extend funding for a youth summer jobs initiative that was created in last year's economic stimulus bill. Similar to a program in the District, the initiative gives localities money to hire young people ages 14 to 24 for clerical work, construction and other entry-level jobs that last six to eight weeks.</br></br>The funding is not specifically allocated based on race, but localities are encouraged to offer jobs to youths who are "most in need," such as high school dropouts and children whose parents are incarcerated -- groups that are disproportionately African American. The CBC hopes the funding will provide for about 300,000 jobs.</br></br>The failure to secure the money illustrates a broader challenge for the CBC. In the midst of the recession, black lawmakers and civil rights advocates have called for specific policies to aid African Americans and other low-income people. Their argument is twofold: At 16 percent, the unemployment rate among blacks is higher than for other groups, and the increase in federal spending to ease the recession could help address persistent unemployment and other long-standing problems for blacks and low-income people.</br></br>Rather than focus their efforts on President Obama, who has expressed reluctance to target funds for blacks or any other group, the CBC has tried to push measures through Congress. But as deficit concerns rise in both parties, the black lawmakers have had little success.
Recent economic statistics paint a picture of an economy growing in a moderate, sustainable fashionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a picture that should calm fears in financial markets that fast growth is about to trigger a new burst of inflation, according to analysts.</br></br>Worries that the economy might overheat were a major factor in driving up long-term interest rates this year as investors sought higher returns to protect themselves against a possible rise in inflation.</br></br>If those fears are allayed, long-term rates should retrace part of their upward track, analysts said.</br></br>Earlier, analysts had predicted that growth would jump to a 4.5 percent or 5 percent annual rate in the three months from April through June, with some economists using numbers as high as 6 percent.</br></br>But with the quarter half over, the flow of statistics on initial claims for jobless benefits, retail sales, automobile production, housing starts and new orders for long-lasting goods all suggest that the economy is expanding at a solid but more moderate pace of 3.5 percent to 4 percent, analysts said.
Xerox Corp.'s reinvention of itself as a business-services outsourcer after a century focused on selling printers and copiers has shown signs of promise, but some investors remain unpersuaded about the company's growth prospects.</br></br>"Xeroxing" a document has become synonymous with photocopying it -- an increasingly irrelevant concept in today's digital-document age for the iconic Norwalk, Conn., company that has become a leader in the digital-imaging industry.</br></br>To boost its competitiveness, Xerox built a business that offers services to companies. That business now accounts for about half of the company's total revenue. This includes managing New Jersey's E-ZPass toll collection system and administering Procter & Gamble Co.'s employee benefits.</br></br>The cornerstone of Xerox's services strategy was its $6.4 billion acquisition last year of outsourcer Affiliated Computer Services, which more than doubled Xerox's headcount and has helped boost revenue in recent quarters. ACS handles business processes and information technology for companies and government agencies to help them cut costs and focus on their core operations.</br></br>Xerox has forecast revenue will rise 4% to 6% next year, as it expects both itself and ACS will win contracts that neither business could have competed for individually. Xerox also said the ACS deal would improve margins and bring in recurring revenue streams that generate a lot of cash for potential share buybacks.
THE UNEMPLOYMENT rate rose to 7.1% in December, a 5 1/2-year high, from 6.9% in November, while the number of jobs barely increased. The data, which Bush called disappointing, suggest the economy is neither getting much worse nor getting any better. Democratic leaders, meanwhile, plan to propose further extensions in joblessness benefits.</br></br>Greenspan indicated the Fed intends to hold interest rates steady for a while unless the economy worsens. Last month's rate cut will probably be enough to boost the economy, he said, warning against big fiscal steps.</br></br>---</br></br>R.H.

NEW YORK, March 18 (ï¿½ï¿½*>) The stock market staged a re- ; covery today that sent it back ! up to its old peaks.</br></br>There was pretty good vigor in todayï¿½Ûªs advance, and the market was quite broad.

That meant the spread of easy money, and the stock market was encouraged.</br></br>The Associated Press average of_60 stocks in gaining 60 cents at" $116.40, was boosted by a hike of $1.00 in the industrial component, a rise of 40 cents in the rails, and a gain of 30 cents in utilities.
The Securities and Exchange Commission supports changes in the law that would limit how much foreign investors may borrow to buy stocks, putting them on an equal footing with American investors, an SEC commissioner said yesterday.</br></br>Testifying before a Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs subcommittee, Philip A. Loomis Jr. said that the agency supports proposed legislation that would ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½fill a gap ... that seems to favor foreign nationals in efforts to acquire control of U.S. corporations.ï¿½Û</br></br>The subcommittee is considering two bills. One, introduced by Sen. Al-fonse M. Dï¿½ÛªAmato (R-N.Y.), would extend U.S. margin requirements to foreign investors. The margin requirements allow potential investors to borrow only 50 percent of the value of the stock they seek to acquire.</br></br>Another bill, introduced by Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.), would impose the margin requirement only on investors seeking to buy 5 percent or more of a companyï¿½Ûªs stock. The Kassebaum bill also would im- pose a nine-month moratorium on acquisitions of more than 5 percent of the voting stock of any U.S. energy corporation by Canadian investors.</br></br>Both proposed pieces of legislation are in response to Canadian restrictions on U.S. investment there and recent takeovers or attempted takeovers of American firms by Canadian companies. Witnesses protested that the Canadian companies have been able to borrow 100 percent of the purchase price to buy control of American companies, even in cases where the acquiring firm was significantly smaller than its target.
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission said yesterday that he has ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½put some distance" between himself and other members of the White House stock market task force headed by Treasury Undersecretary George Gould.</br></br>' :-David Ruder made the remarks in an interview after a hearing before the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee, where the Republican SEC chairman at times found himself allied with House Democrats who were attacking the Reagan administration.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½At the hearing, subcommittee chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) praised Ruder for supporting new market legislation-drafted in response to the Oct. 19 stock collapseï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but criticized other members of the task force, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Wendy Lee Gramm, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</br></br>harshly than has your boss, President Reagan," Markey said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½For you have missed an historic opportunity to erect a dynamic, coherent and unified regulatory structure."</br></br>In a brief appearance near the hearingï¿½Ûªs conclusion, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D-Mich.) warned of the possibility of another stock market collapse. He instructed the regulators not ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½td come by my office" when the public goes after government officials ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½who sat idly by" instead of acting to restore investor confidence.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to add between 555 and 600 stores globally next year, adding 60 million square feet and becoming more aggressive in the number of supercenters it opens, Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in an interview.</br></br>The world's largest retailer by sales plans to open 270 to 280 supercenters, which sell groceries and general merchandise, in the U.S. About 160 of these will be expansions or relocations of former discount stores. This year Wal-Mart had estimated it would add between 240 and 255 supercenters, but will end up with 266 new ones.</br></br>"We are ahead of plan and the practical reality is that they are getting more difficult to open, but we're putting a larger number of projects in the hopper," Mr. Schoewe said shortly before Wal-Mart began its two-day analyst conference yesterday at its Bentonville, Ark., headquarters.</br></br>Wal-Mart has seen sales growth in the U.S. slow down this year because of tougher competition, an uneven economic recovery and higher fuel prices. Nonetheless, the retailer's store-opening plans indicate it is bullish on its growth prospects. Indeed, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott said yesterday, "We could be three or four times bigger in the U.S."</br></br>Mr. Scott expects local zoning and land-use laws to grow stricter in coming years. The company is reckoning that stores built and opened sooner rather than later will face fewer delays. Already the company has seen projects in certain areas take longer to gain approval than elsewhere.
Prices have been soaring long enough and fast enough, economists say, that the nation is at risk of a self-reinforcing cycle of inflation like that experienced in the 1970s.</br></br>It is a risk Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke highlighted in a speech yesterday, saying that the falling value of the dollar can feed into inflation expectations, and that rapid price escalation, if sustained, "might lead the public to expect higher long-term inflation rates, an expectation that ultimately could become self-confirming."</br></br>For some businesses that already is the reality. Many companies making long-term investments are assuming that prices will rise at a pace well above that of the past 20 years, as they pencil in larger price increases for the supplies they buy and the prices they charge. Consumers are coming to take rapidly escalating food and energy prices for granted. And labor unions are starting to push harder for across-the-board wage increases, though overall wages are still climbing slowly.</br></br>U.S. consumers expect prices to rise 7.7 percent in the coming year, according to the Conference Board, a research company. Investors expect inflation over the coming decade to average 3.4 percent based on bond market data analyzed by the Cleveland Fed. That is well above the Fed's unofficial target of about 2 percent.</br></br>When the price of food or gasoline goes up, economists generally think of it as a one-time bump. For the past four years, it hasn't been. The last time there were sharp and sustained increases in those prices, in the 1970s, a wage and price spiral developed that was so severe that the Fed had to engineer the deepest downturn since the Great Depression to end it.
When you hear that Apple has released a new product, you think of a sleek Macintosh laptop, or perhaps a beautiful program for editing videos. But a spreadsheet? Not a spreadsheet. After all, expertise with spreadsheets is the sort of computing skill about which the "Mac guy" in Apple's TV ads mocks the "PC guy."</br></br>And yet, last week, Apple brought out a new spreadsheet program called Numbers, thus completing one of its least-known products: a productivity suite called iWork. The iWork '08 suite, which competes with the Macintosh version of Microsoft Office, also includes a word- processing program called Pages and a presentation program called Keynote. The two were upgraded last week. IWork costs $79, about half the price of the lowest-cost version of Microsoft Office, which sells for $149.</br></br>In the past 10 years, Apple has out-designed Microsoft and its hardware partners in a number of key areas. But can Apple really take on Microsoft in the category of productivity software, where Office rules on both Windows and the Mac? To find out, I've been testing the new iWork, which runs only on the Mac, against the Mac version of Office.</br></br>My verdict: iWork '08 is a nice product, capable of turning out sophisticated and attractive word-processing, presentation and spreadsheet documents. It can even read Microsoft Office documents, whether created on the Mac or on Windows computers, and can save documents in Microsoft Office formats so they can be opened in Office on the Mac or on Windows.</br></br>But iWork simply isn't as powerful or versatile as Microsoft Office, especially when it comes to word processing and spreadsheets. And it suffers from a design that places far more emphasis on making documents look beautiful than on the nuts and bolts of the actual process of writing and number-crunching.
Interest-rate cuts in Europe sparked a brief dollar rally yesterday, but a subsequent wave of sell orders left the U.S. currency down slightly for the day.</br></br>The dollar's inability to hold onto its gains reinforced the market's bearish sentiment on the U.S. currency, traders said. "Everybody took advantage of the stronger dollar to sell," Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo Ltd.'s New York agency, said.</br></br>Traders attributed the dollar sell-off to disappointment with the deficit-reduction plan reached by White House and congressional negotiators Friday and the continuing large U.S. trade deficits.</br></br>"The disappointment in the budget package and its lukewarm reception is hanging over the dollar and preventing it from moving up dramatically," Ronald H. Holzer, vice president and chief dealer at Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago, said.</br></br>The negotiators' plan to cut the budget deficit in the current fiscal year by $30 billion still requires final approval by Congress.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>The last name of Bob Eidson, a recent graduate of UCLA's Anderson School of Management, was misspelled as Keidson in Monday's Outlook column.</br></br>(WSJ September 29, 2009)</br></br>New companies will be crucial to the strength of any economic recovery. Businesses in their first 90 days of life accounted for 14% of hiring in the U.S. between 1993 and 2008, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</br></br>But this recession is taking a particularly heavy toll on business creation, as sources of small-business funding dry up and would-be entrepreneurs become more risk-averse. When entrepreneurs do launch businesses, they are hiring fewer employees on average. The trends threaten to damp growth in jobs and economic output for years.
Virginia Gov. Mark R. Warner (D) said he believes business leaders who supported his efforts to raise taxes and balance the state's budget will also support John F. Kerry for president because they are concerned about the economy and the size of the federal budget deficit.</br></br>In a conference call with reporters in southern states, Warner said the historical pattern of business leaders backing Republican candidates will be broken this year, nationally and in Virginia.</br></br>"You've got more business support this year for the Kerry ticket than even [Bill] Clinton did in 1992," he said. "There's a real unease among many of the business leaders in the state."</br></br>On Monday, the Kerry campaign released a list of 200 business executives nationwide who have signaled their support for the Democratic nominee. The list contained three names from Virginia: Vinton G. Cerf, senior vice president of technology strategy for MCI; Roger W. Sant, co-founder and chairman emeritus of AES Corp.; and Warren M. Thompson, chairman and president of Thompson Hospitality in Herndon.</br></br>The Democratic National Committee has begun airing a television ad in Virginia called "Strength" that uses clips from Kerry's acceptance speech at the party's nominating convention last week.
NEW YORK -- The U.S. economy still is expanding at a moderate pace despite the stock market's Oct. 19 collapse, according to a survey of 17 economists by The Wall Street Journal.</br></br>But most predict much slower growth early next year, and a majority also anticipate lower interest rates. "I'm expecting a slowdown because of the shock to lending and spending that will come out of the crash," says Neal M. Soss, managing director and chief economist at First Boston Corp.</br></br>According to the average estimate of the 17 analysts, the economy is growing at a 3% annual rate this quarter, after adjusting for inflation. Their average forecast for next year's first quarter is that economic growth will slow to a 1.5% pace. Only two of the 17 -- Irwin L. Kellner of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. and H. Erich Heinemann of Moseley Securities -- foresee the start of a recession by next March.</br></br>One reason so many analysts expect continued growth is the unexpected strength of business activity prior to Oct. 19. "The economy's pre-crash strength provides reasonable assurance we won't have a recession anytime soon even though consumer spending will slow," says Lyle Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor who now is chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.</br></br>Also, federal income tax cuts scheduled to go into effect next year should help stimulate the economy, says Alan Reynolds, chief economist of Polyconomics Inc., a Morristown, N.J., consulting firm. "There is a lot of income being shuffled from this year's fourth quarter into next year's first quarter" to take advantage of lower tax rates, he says, adding, "I'm expecting a few checks myself in January, which I've deliberately deferred from this year."
You know things are getting desperate when capitalists start thinking that a banking nationalization is better than the status quo. That's what it's coming to in Japan, where even sober analysts are starting to bet on a government takeover of the country's troubled banks.</br></br>It's also what happens when a country prefers to sweep its problems under the rug for a decade or so. By now there could be as much as $1.5 trillion in bad loans at Japan's banks, an additional $1 trillion in insurance companies and a similar amount in the postal saving system.</br></br>That's "a total of $3 trillion to $4 trillion of loans that are uncollectible or troubled," says Japan-watcher Anthony Miller, writing in The Asian Wall Street Journal this week, "or between 75% and 100% of Japanese GDP." America's S&L crisis, which involved an amount equivalent to less than 5% of U.S. GDP, pales in contrast.</br></br>But the difference is that the U.S. faced the S&L problem squarely, albeit with the usual political messiness. Some careers were ruined (Fernand St Germain), and some people went to jail (Charlie Keating), but the failures were liquidated, depositors were paid off and the market found a bottom. In Japan, by contrast, the system hasn't enforced any accountability and so the banks have been allowed to roam the landscape like financial zombies.</br></br>Tokyo's stock market is signaling that crunch time may now finally be approaching for several of these walking dead. The share price of UFJ Holdings, Japan's fourth-biggest bank by assets, is down 50% this month. Mizuho Holdings, the world's biggest bank, is down 40%. With the new banking minister pressuring banks to come clean about their nonperforming-loans, first-half earnings reports could contain some nasty surprises next week.
Fiat Industrial has lost faith in the Italian stock market, if not--yet--in Italy itself.</br></br>The truck maker's plans to merge with its 88%-owned subsidiary CNH, which makes tractors in the U.S. under the Case and New Holland brands, will also bring its listing to New York from Milan. Italians fear Fiat Industrial's stock-market relocation might mean it starts shifting actual operations out of Italy, too. The company firmly denies that--though its divergent results must make the idea tempting.</br></br>The valuation logic is clear. CNH trades at a significant discount to its U.S. peers like Caterpillar and Deere, reflecting its small, 12% free float. The Fiat Industrial group has been a victim of the Italian stock market's decline, which is trading more cheaply than other European bourses bar Greece and Austria. At 4.3 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Fiat Industrial trades at a 12%-33% discount to peers Volvo, MAN and Scania. A full U.S. listing should give it a valuation closer to U.S. multiples.</br></br>The merger should also lower Fiat Industrial's exposure to expensive Italian debt, potentially halving its annual [euro]400 million (about $495 million) net interest cost, Sanford C. Bernstein estimates. And if Fiat Industrial ever needs to raise new equity, that should be easier in New York's deeper-pocketed markets than in struggling Italy.</br></br>Still, this sensible restructuring shouldn't necessarily herald a broader move out of Italy for Fiat Industrial. That it has provoked such fears says much about Italian insecurity about the country's loss of competitiveness. In practice, Fiat Industrial would find it costly to move from Italy, where it has nearly a quarter of its plants and employees; in the last five years it has invested [euro]3 billion in the country.
The 1.3 percent raise that federal and military retirees will get in January will be the lowest cost-of-living adjustment they've received since 1986, when they also got a 1.3 percent COLA. The increase is official and will first show up in checks received in January.</br></br>People getting Social Security benefits -- and that includes many federal retirees, too -- will also get the 1.3 percent raise. It reflects the rise in living costs, as measured by the consumer price index between the third quarter of this year (July, August and September) and the third quarter of 1997. In other words, inflation for that 12-month period rose only 1.3 percent.</br></br>While many retirees are disappointed with a COLA of only 1.3 percent, most experts say it is a good thing because it means inflation is low and prices are stable. Retirees longing for the good old days of double-digit COLAs forget what double-digit inflation can do to prices on everything from food to cars. In 1979, retirees got a 10.8 percent COLA. In 1980, the COLA was 13.7 percent. And in 1981 (the last time retirees got two raises in one year), they got 13.1 percent. That was a period of double-digit inflation. It also was before Congress voted to eliminate the twice-a-year COLAs that some feared would eventually push the cost of civil service retirement higher than payroll costs.</br></br>Since that time, federal retirees have had to fight regularly (and usually with success) to get one full COLA a year. There was no COLA adjustment in 1985, and Congress and the White House delayed COLAs for three months (paying them in April instead of January) in 1994, 1995 and 1996.</br></br>Workers who retire under the old Civil Service Retirement System get a full COLA each year. Workers who retire under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System are under a "diet COLA" system. They get a full COLA on the CSRS portion of their annuity. But the FERS portion of their annuity is subject to different rules. For example, if living costs (as measured by the CPI) are up 2 percent or less, both groups get the same increase. But if the rise in living costs is between 2 and 3 percent, CSRS benefits go up by the full amount, while payments on the FERS portion rise by only 2 percent. If the CPI goes up 3 percent or more, FERS benefits equal the CPI minus 1 percent.
NEW YORK -- Benign inflation data and soothing comments by Federal Reserve officials sparked the biggest one-day rally in the bond market in over six months, as investors regained their confidence that inflation will remain quiescent and the Fed will hold off on an interest-rate increase, at least for the next month.</br></br>In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up 1 24/32, or $17.50 for a bond with $1,000 face value, at 102 12/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell back through the 6% barrier that was crossed during Monday's rout, to trade at 5.944%.</br></br>Two-year notes rose 8/32 to yield 5.558%, more than making up for Monday's loss of 6/32.</br></br>"The economic numbers caught people leaning the wrong way," said Barbara Kenworthy, who manages almost $9 billion in fixed-income assets at Prudential Investments. "They take pressure off the Fed for a rate increase in May and a lot of the pressure off for a July move, though they'll have to see more data."</br></br>The market's rally came on heavy trading, underscoring the marked shift in sentiment on the part of investors who earlier this week were counting down to an increase in interest rates. In all, $111.1 billion of Treasurys were traded, according to GovPx Inc., the second-busiest day of the year.
In and around the city where he presided over the end of the Cold War, where he defined an American conservative ethos and where he nearly lost his life to an assassin, Ronald Reagan was remembered yesterday as a towering, almost old-fashioned figure.</br></br>"He was a great man, a man of decision," said the Rev. Mupenda Muzumbi, 49, of Fort Washington, who was at Reagan National Airport, one of several Washington area institutions renamed in honor of the 40th president.</br></br>The news of Reagan's death yesterday, though not unexpected, unleashed a great wave of nostalgia. "More than just a man died," said Bill Enrico, 47, a self-described Republican who also was at the airport. "An era of greater decency died."</br></br>Like other admirers, Enrico saw Reagan's presidency as a time of personal opportunity for his family. He and his wife were able to buy a home after years of high interest rates during the Carter administration, he said. Thinking back on the Reagan era also produced a kind of longing in Enrico; when Reagan was in charge, he said, politics seemed less bitter.</br></br>But not everyone remembered the former president in such positive terms. In the liberal enclave of Takoma Park, Lisa Ripkin, 37, an employee of the Takoma Park Co-Op, said Reagan's death gave her "inner peace." She felt that it closed a chapter in U.S. political history with which she disagreed.
The Labor Department has ended federal supplemental unemployment benefits for about 7,700 District and Virginia residents because those who qualify for unemployment insurance in the two jurisdictions has dropped below 5 per cent.</br></br>Unemployed workers in 11 other states also have become ineligible for the sup-ï¿½Û¢ plcmental jobless benefits, although benefits remain intact in states where the percentage of those entitled to unemployment insurance has remained above 5 per cent of the total work force.</br></br>The federal funding that paid for unemployment compensation for an additional 13 weeks beyond normal benefits ended in D.C. and Virginia on April 3. According to a Labor Department spokesman, out-of-work residents who had drawn only part of the 13 weeksï¿½Ûª benefits by then would become eligible to draw the remainder if the program were triggered ag,ain.</br></br>The supplemental benefits were provided under emergency legislation in early 1975, as a last resort for those who have used up their eligibility under regular and extended Insurance programs. Where the insured unemployment rate (the percentage of eligible claimants to the total work force) is above 5 per cent, the benefits extend total coverage from 39 to 52 weeks.</br></br>When the rate drops below 5 per cent for.,13 weeks, the program is Cut off, according to the Labor Department.
The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in December but was still the second-highest monthly figure ever. And that lifted the deficit for 2004 to $617.7 billion -- an all-time high that shattered the previous record, set in 2003, by 24 percent.</br></br>The trade report, issued yesterday by the Commerce Department, capped a year in which the voracious demand by Americans for imported goods drove the deficit to proportions all but unheard of for a major industrial country -- 5.3 percent of gross domestic product, up from 4.5 percent the year before. The widening gap has deepened worries that the United States is growing dangerously dependent on the capital lent by foreigners to cover the cost of the products they sell to Americans.</br></br>The December deficit decline to $56.4 billion from a revised record of $59.3 billion in November offered some hope that the trade gap's relentless surge might abate in coming months. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week that the deficit may soon start leveling off and possibly even shrink. Greenspan cited the dollar's fall against other currencies, which makes U.S.-made goods more competitive with products made abroad.</br></br>But yesterday's report offered insight into why a turnaround may be a long way off, because as the Commerce summary noted, imports increased nearly twice as much as exports last year. That is the opposite of what must happen for the deficit to narrow. Since the $1.764 trillion that the United States imported in 2004 is so much greater than the $1.146 trillion that it shipped abroad, exports must grow much faster than imports to close the gap.</br></br>"The U.S. trade deficit narrowed sharply, but let's not get carried away," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors, in a report to clients. "The level is still the second highest we have ever recorded . . . the deficit is still way too wide."
U.S. TOURIST SPOTS are mostly jammed this summer.</br></br>The post-recession surge in consumer buying isn't played out yet, resorts say. "People have money to spend, and if they don't, they're using plastic," says John Parisi, general manager of Margate Four Seasons Lake Front Resort in New Hampshire. Tourist traffic is about 10% stronger than last year's at Miramar Hotel in Santa Barbara, Calif. Holiday World, a theme park in Indiana, enjoyed a 27% jump in June traffic -- despite an admission price of $7.95, up from $6.25 last year.</br></br>But such gains aren't universal. Sea World traffic in Southern California was lower in May and June than in the same months last year. Because of the strength this year of the U.S. dollar, foreign resorts may be drawing some business away from the U.S. "This is the hottest year we've had for people going overseas," says an executive of Prescott Travel, a Chicago agency.</br></br>Most U.S. resorts say the outlook for fall is bullish. "No question about it," says a Newport (R.I.) Travel Center official. "The crowd will stay strong."</br></br>---
Correction? What correction?</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 198.25 points, or 1.88%, to 10718.09, on top of a 94.63 gain Monday. The Dow has now recovered in two days all of Friday's 218.42-point loss and more.</br></br>At Friday's close, the industrials were down 11% from their Jan. 14 high, in what Wall Street calls a correction, or a drop of at least 10%. Now the surging blue chips are down just 8.6% from that high. Beaten-down old-industry stocks such as Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing again led the gains, along with financial stocks such as American Express.</br></br>Big technology stocks also staged a recovery, but last year's tech highfliers, such as Qualcomm and JDS Uniphase, didn't keep pace. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose a marginal 0.05%, or 2.22 points, to 4420.77. But that small gain was the product of a huge afternoon recovery; the tech-led Nasdaq had been down as much as 127.45 in the morning and recovered all of its losses before trading ended.</br></br>Bonds fell, and the dollar was mixed.
NEW YORK -- Small stocks rose in light trading as investors' tentativeness continued to prevent the market from establishing direction.</br></br>Some selective bargain-hunting took place, but investors mostly reacted to news on individual issues, leaving a scattering of gains and declines.</br></br>Major indexes traded in very narrow ranges. The Russell 2000 Index, which measures small-capitalization issues that trade on the Nasdaq Stock Market and the other major exchanges, inched up 0.41, or 0.17%, to 247.65.</br></br>The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.26, or 0.30%, to finish at 745.84.</br></br>The breadth of the market was positive for the day, with advancers ahead of decliners, 1,752 to 1,424, on Nasdaq total volume of 290.3 million shares, compared with the previous day's 248.7 million shares.
ECONOMIC RIPPLES from last week's terrorist attacks are being felt in all regions of the U.S. But the force of the impact will depend very much on where you live.</br></br>Among the hardest hit will be states and cities built on tourism, including Florida and Las Vegas. They were holding up best amid a slumping economy before the attacks. But now that air travel has been hobbled by security fears, sharply reduced visits by vacationers and business travelers have dimmed those economic bright spots.</br></br>A few regions may weather the storm better: oil-producing economies such as Houston and Louisiana; defense-contracting strongholds such as Southern California and northern Virginia; and areas where displaced Manhattan firms are setting up temporary or permanent offices, most notably New Jersey, which could gain as many as 100,000 jobs.</br></br>Still, few places, if any, will escape unscathed. "There is no part of the country whose outlook has not worsened," says Mark Vitner, economist for First Union Securities in Charlotte, N.C.</br></br>The impact of the attacks will whack from one to more than three percentage points off anticipated growth in output over the next nine months, depending on the region and whether the expected U.S. military response is relatively quickly resolved or protracted and uncertain. Overall, the U.S. gross national product -- the value of all goods and services produced -- would grow only 1.5% between the second quarters of 2001 and 2002 under the more optimistic scenario and contract 0.05% under the more pessimistic assumption, according to Economy.com, a West Chester, Pa., economic-consulting firm. That compares with a pre-attack forecast of 2.55% growth.
WASHINGTON -- Next week, the Federal Reserve is likely to end the easiest monetary policy in its modern history by raising interest rates for the first time in four years. And if all goes according to plan, the markets will barely blink.</br></br>Fed officials are almost certain to boost their target for the federal-funds rate, charged on overnight loans between banks, to 1.25% from 1%, when their two-day meeting ends Wednesday afternoon. They have labored for nearly a year to ensure that this increase, and those to follow, are fully anticipated. The approach reflects a tactical shift to an innovative communications strategy that is aimed at incrementally guiding markets toward the inevitable rate boost.</br></br>There may yet be surprises next week. Fed officials are wrestling with whether to indicate, as they did after their May meeting, that future rate increases will be "measured," a euphemism for moving in quarter-percentage-point increments. Some officials, mostly hawkish reserve bank presidents, see the risk of inflation accelerating and think the "measured" language limits their ability to raise rates faster if needed. More dovish officials argue that the term still reflects their likeliest course of action and that they can change their words quickly if inflation does pick up. The latter view likely will prevail, though the Fed may make it more explicit that the measured pace will be dropped if inflation risks rise.</br></br>Some analysts, citing mounting reports of rising prices, say the Fed has waited too long to raise its rates. But Fed officials note that the mere anticipation of a rate increase has had the practical effect of an actual increase. Long-term interest rates, including those on mortgages, are up sharply since March, driving down new mortgage applications. Higher borrowing costs will restrain spending and inflation pressure.</br></br>Stocks have mostly treaded water for two weeks, waiting for the move. While stock prices typically decline when the cost of credit rises, some analysts say investors have had so much time to prepare for higher rates that the market might strengthen on the news. Still, a half-point increase, though highly unlikely, or a hint of one to come, likely would squelch any such euphoria.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker yesterday predicted that a major international banking agreement among the leading industrial countries would be signed by the end of the year.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think it will be done,ï¿½Û said Volcker in his farewell appearance before the House Banking Committee. Tm sorry I won't be here to see it.ï¿½Û</br></br>Such an agreement ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½would be a big step forwardï¿½Û toward reducing competitive pressure between banking systems, Volcker said. Foreign banks now often have lower capital requirements than U.S. banks, enabling them to offer better rates to borrowers.</br></br>Appearing relaxed and jovial, Volcker listened to a slew of tributes from the unusually large number of members of the subcommittee on financial institutions supervision, regulation and insurance who showed up for what was billed as a hearing on globalization of financial markets.</br></br>D.C. Del. Walter Fauntroy declared, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½When the history of the fourth quarter of the 20th century is written, your name will be [remembered as] one who made the most important contribution to the economic recovery of this nation and the economic stability of the world.ï¿½Û And committee chairman Fernand St Germain (D-R.I.) closed the session with an emotional ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½thank youï¿½Û to Volcker.
NEW YORK -- The dollar fell fast but not far after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that the budget package is credible and that its adoption "most certainly" would cause a decline in interest rates.</br></br>Failure to enact the agreement "would, in my estimation, be a grave mistake," the Fed chairman said.</br></br>The greenback would be hurt by softer U.S. interest rates because lower yields make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to investors. But yesterday's losses were limited because the dollar neared its record low against the mark and because market participants doubted that Mr. Greenspan would have his way. Passage of the budget agreement by the Senate and House is uncertain, and bond investors may not take as sanguine a view of the proposed spending cuts and tax increases as the Fed chief has.</br></br>The budget accord aims to take $40.1 billion off the federal budget deficit in fiscal 1991, and $500 billion over five years, through a combination of tax increases and spending cuts.</br></br>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at 1.5425 marks, down from 1.5495 marks late Tuesday in New York. The dollar bottomed out at 1.5403 marks, nearing its record low of 1.5385 marks, set Aug. 27.
[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</br></br>The Federal Reserve will debate this week whether it is time to scale back bond purchases. One argument against: Inflation is far too low.</br></br>Since January 2012, the Fed has set as its target a long-term inflation rate of 2%. And since then, inflation has fallen increasingly short of that.</br></br>As of July, the Commerce Department's price index for personal-consumption expenditures, excluding food and energy -- the Fed's preferred measure -- was running just 1.2% above its year-earlier level.</br></br>To get to 2% by the end of 2013, the index would have had to increase at a 3% annual rate in the final five months of the year. It hasn't held that sort of pace since the early 1990s.
The Federal Reserve cited moderating growth when it paused in its rate-increase campaign this week, and concerns about the economic outlook seem to be growing among economists.</br></br>This month's WSJ.com economic-forecasting survey showed projections for gross domestic product and employment growth were cut, while forecasts for consumer prices and oil prices were lifted. Economists continued to nudge higher their estimates of the probability of a recession over the next 12 months; on average, they put the likelihood at 26%, up from 20% in June and 15% in February.</br></br>Economists, on average, forecast GDP growth at a 2.8% annual rate for the third quarter, the first time their forecast for that quarter has been under 3% since the economic-forecasting survey first asked about the period in November 2005. While their forecast is slightly above the 2.5% real GDP growth recorded in the second quarter, it is well below the 5.6% growth in the first quarter and average annual growth rate of 3.2% from 2003 to 2005. The economists forecast growth slowing to a 2.6% rate in the fourth quarter, and staying at that rate for the first half of 2007. GDP is the broadest measure of economic output.</br></br>"The economy has definitely slowed below trend," said Ethan Harris at Lehman Brothers. "Second-quarter GDP is soft, employment numbers are coming in soft and the housing market is finally softening."</br></br>Oil prices remained at the forefront of concerns, as 43% of economists -- 20 of the 46 who answered the question -- indicated higher costs presented the biggest risk to their GDP outlook. At the same time, the average year-end forecast for crude-oil prices was lifted to $69.50 a barrel. That is up by more than $4 since the last survey, conducted in June, but below the recent level of oil prices, which have traded in the mid-$70s this week. The economists expect prices to drop to $65.25 by next June.
Former President Herbert j Hoover warned last night that! further tax cuts will bring a' new wave of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Û¢inflationï¿½Û and endanger United States defensej ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½against the Communist horde." j The white-haired cldcr| statesman called for a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ period of self-denialï¿½Û by the nation to restore a sound economy.</br></br>Hoover, who heads the administration's Commission on 'Organization seeking means to See HOOVER, Page 4-M, Col. <1</br></br>He told the annual dinner meeting of the American Society of Newspaper Editors that a red-ink budget can be ended only by further sharp reductions in Federal expenditures and no new tax cuts.</br></br>He warned that inflation, which he said had been brought on by 23 years of deficit-financing, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is the surest road to disaster in our defense against the Communist horde.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We could both cure the budget deficit and many of the pains of taxes without lessening our effectiveness in defense or in the needed functions of government if we could now have a period of self-degjal and patience.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½As sure as the sun sets, their continuation will produce the darkness of rising prices, and wages, no matter what some cheery economists may say.ï¿½Û The former President charged ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½pressure groupsï¿½Û with lobbying to keep Government expenditure at abnormal levels.
BEGINNING NEXT MONTH, speculators bored with trading mortgages, credit-card receivables and heating-oil futures will be able to bet directly on the number of Americans who have jobs.</br></br>At first, this sounds like a bad idea, one that strips away all subterfuge and truly turns Wall Street into a betting parlor. Imagine the bearish trader celebrating as wire services report that U.S. employers cut their payrolls in September. The more layoffs, the more he makes. He cheers. Cue the angry mobs.</br></br>Although individual investors won't be able to participate just yet, this may be a step toward something more socially useful: a way for ordinary Americans to insure against risks such as falling home prices, a sinking economy or a resurgence of inflation.</br></br>"The sharing of economic risk is one of society's deepest concerns, and rightly so," Yale University economist Robert Shiller says. "To the extent that inequality is created by pure luck, it's not only painful, but a shame." Sharing harm from bad luck is the reason for life insurance and government insurance against temporary unemployment. Global financial giants offer big companies ways to hedge the risks of unwelcome turns in interest rates, currencies and commodity prices. So why, Mr. Shiller asked in a 1993 book, doesn't our increasingly sophisticated market system allow more ordinary folks to share their largest economic risks?</br></br>The short answer: No one institution is wealthy enough to shoulder these risks, and most early attempts to develop markets to spread the risks have flopped. The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange's attempt to establish a futures market in the consumer-price index, essentially insurance against inflation, died in the early 1980s as a result of lack of interest. The London Futures and Options Exchange's experiment with betting on real-estate prices collapsed in the early 1990s amid reports that false trades had inflated trading volume.
There's a bit of bad news for all those oh-so-clever Republicans who sported the button that shouted, "It's Spending ... STUPID!" during Wednesday's State of the Union Address.

An April 12 editorial calling for comprehensive immigration reform reinforced the misperception that waiver authority granted under Section 102 of the Real ID Act would pertain only to environmental laws that affect the building of a fence along the California border.</br></br>That section would give the secretary of homeland security blanket authority to ignore all federal, state and local laws -- at his discretion and without judicial review -- that he determines would interfere with the construction of barriers and roads along our borders. No federal agency or official has ever been provided with such a blanket exemption from judicial review and the rule of law.</br></br>The Post is correct in saying that the only way to achieve comprehensive immigration reform is to address the problems with our immigration system head-on. Unfortunately, the Real ID Act is a poorly conceived proposal that ignores basic American values of fairness and decency and undermines the rule of law. Congress needs to start over.</br></br>By reporting only the choice between raising the visa quota for foreign tech workers and outsourcing the work to India [Business, April 8], S. Mitra Kalita added to the "confusion" over H-1B visas. Her story ignored the concerns of U.S. workers. In both "choices," an American worker with a college education is deprived of the opportunity to work or enter the field, and U.S. capital heads overseas.</br></br>Importing workers in large numbers fuels a race to the bottom for U.S. workers and employers. The H-1B program has no displacement protections for U.S. workers.
Lanny Davis, campaign manager for former Montgomery County executive Sid Kramer, sings the same old song about Montgomery's tax revolt {Close to Home, June 9}, but he has some of the words wrong.</br></br>Davis contends that Montgomery's tax revolt is centered in what he calls the affluent down-county area. It isn't. Strong support for holding property tax increases to the rate of inflation was reaffirmed recently by the Montgomery County Civic Federation, which represents more than 70 civic groups countywide. Equally strong support was voted by the Allied Civic Group, which represents 40 citizens' groups in eastern and northern Montgomery.</br></br>No one in Montgomery objects to paying a fair share of taxes, assuming the money isn't wasted. But county property taxes aren't related to ability to pay. A family making $200,000 a year may live next door to someone on a small, fixed income, yet they pay the same property taxes.</br></br>Rather than constantly increasing property taxes, we should win legislative approval for raising the piggyback income tax, starting at the $75,000 to $100,000 level. Only the 5 percent of our taxpayers report incomes of $100,000 or more. If more revenue is needed, it should come from them.</br></br>We also want, and shortly will have, a tax that requires developers to pay a small share of the huge road and school costs their developments create. Davis seems to prefer the system under which homeowners have footed 80 percent of the county's bills.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The remarkable U.S. economic (expansion entered its seventh year last month in a state that seemed to tnany experts and ordinary Americans almost too good to be ttue: an economy that had been growing at its highest rate in a decade, wages outpacing low inflation and a jobless rate continuing to fall.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Todayï¿½Ûªs employment report also shows that inflationary forces remain in check,ï¿½Û said White House economist Janet L. Yellen. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½With earnings growth at 3.6 percent over the last 12 months, we are well within that lucky range where workers are receiving well-deserved real wage increases, but there are still no signs of inflationary pressures.ï¿½Û</br></br>Reflecting this happy state of affairs, the University of Michiganï¿½Ûªs measure of consumer sentiment last</br></br>Economists continue to be surprised by how well the economy has performed and how this late in a period of expansion, growth could reach a 5.6 percent annual rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½as it was reported earlier this week to have done in the first three months of this yearï¿½ï¿½ï¿½without causing inflation to surge.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½If I had told my colleagues three or four years ago that as of today, we would have flat or declining inflation indicators and unemployment edging under 5 percent, they would SeeECONOMY,A12,CoLl have said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½You are smoking pot, and not for medical reasons,' ï¿½Û said economist Charles L.

IN THE DAYS when the United States was a creditor, it drew a steady stream of investment income from abroad to raise the American standard of living. But now that the country is a debtor, the stream has reversed and-for the first time since 1914-the net flow is going abroad. That's another signal of an approaching crisis.</br></br>This country's international deficit was running, in the summer quarter, at a rate of $173.5 billion a year. That's the amount the rest of the world has to put into this country, in dollars, to keep its economy in balance. But the rest of the world is getting tired of it. The appeal of putting billions more into the dollar, a declining currency that its own government refuses to defend, is very limited. Not only the United States but all the trading nations together are headed toward a disaster unless they can change course rapidly and forcefully.</br></br>The necessary moves are pretty clear. Last month the Institute for International Economics here convened a gathering of 33 economists from most of the major trading countries. They quickly sketched out a strategy that belongs to neither the ideological right nor the left, but represents a wide international consensus among specialists who are not in government and can speak freely.</br></br>Devaluing the dollar has gone just about far enough, they warned. Continuing drops in the exchange rate won't balance American trade. They will just generate inflation.</br></br>Any serious remedy has to begin with an attack on the U.S. budget deficit. That's central. It's straining and distorting monetary relationships worldwide. If the United States started to bring that deficit down by $40 billion a year, that would buy enough time and good will to do other necessary things-like bringing down its trade deficit equally fast. It's got to swing toward surplus by a massive $150 billion to $200 billion over the next four or five years to bring it to a size that this country can finance.
The White House forecast yesterday that the U.S. budget deficit for this year will be a highest-ever $445 billion, lower than the administration previously predicted but nearly 20 percent larger than last year's record shortfall.</br></br>President Bush's budget director, while calling the figure "unwelcome," said the new forecast for fiscal 2004 -- in line with recent congressional forecasts -- provides evidence that the economy is growing and tax receipts are recovering. The message echoed a new refrain in Bush's campaign speeches, voiced repeatedly yesterday in Missouri: "We're turning the corner, and we're not turning back."</br></br>But Democrats -- and the campaign of presidential nominee John F. Kerry -- countered that the new estimate looks good only in comparison with a previous estimate of $521 billion that was unrealistically high. They noted that the deficit is still on pace to be $70 billion higher than last year's $375 billion.</br></br>Further clouding the economic picture, the Commerce Department announced that economic growth slowed sharply in the second quarter, to an annual rate of 3 percent, from a revised rate of 4.5 percent in the first quarter. Dragged down by the lowest consumer spending in three years, the quarterly growth rate was the lowest since the first quarter of 2003.</br></br>In addition, the Labor Department announced yesterday that from the start of 2001 to the end of 2003, 11.4 million workers were displaced from jobs -- 5.3 million of them from jobs they had held for three or more years. Though two-thirds of the 5.3 million found new jobs, 57 percent of those who did find work earned less than they had previously.
AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>Both the stock and bond markets opened with sharp declines. But a wave of afternoon buying pulled stocks off of their lows. The recovery was especially apparent in the technology sector.</br></br>"This group is notorious for very quick reversals," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal. He pointed out that it wasn't the first time that investors have started buying tech stocks after they have fallen to a certain point. "The sell-off in the tech sector looks finished," he declared.</br></br>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell in the morning and stayed down for the rest of the day. Analysts said there was no one single reason for the sell-off.</br></br>"One thing that is happening is that people are beginning to adjust down their expectations that the Federal Reserve may ease interest rates," said Mickey D. Levy, chief financial economist at NationsBank. The Fed's policy-setting committee meets on Tuesday of next week.
Market turmoil in the U.S. sent shock waves as far as Asia, a sign of the close connection among distant financial markets. But many analysts say the region's economies might suffer far less damage, a feat that would show they have become less dependent on the American economy.</br></br>Troubles in the U.S. market for subprime mortgages have triggered a widespread flight from risk and driven down financial markets around the world. In an effort to calm the markets, Japan's central bank is expected to leave its short-term interest-rate target at 0.5% this week, rather than raising it as previously expected.</br></br>But barring any major broadening of the credit crunch, the effects on Asia's real economies -- things like production aimed at consumer spending and exports -- could be relatively modest, analysts say, even if the turmoil triggers a slowdown in the U.S. That's because, by many measures, Asian economies appear to be growing less reliant on the U.S.</br></br>Indeed, less than a week after the U.S. market's most violent movements, China's central bank raised its key interest rate yesterday because strong growth is driving up inflation.</br></br>Meanwhile, many Southeast Asian countries are benefiting from investment aimed at their domestic markets. For the first time since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Indonesia's government is planning to finance projects to improve the country's transportation and energy infrastructure. Indonesian companies also are gearing up for expansion.
NEW YORK -- The economy maintained a hearty pace in November, though it slipped slightly from the previous month's surprisingly robust level, the nation's purchasing managers said.</br></br>The latest monthly survey by the National Association of Purchasing Management found that production and new order rates slowed from the previous month, but employment rose at the strongest rate in the past 12 months.</br></br>"November's robust showing underscores the strength remaining in the economy as it entered the seventh year of recovery," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's national business survey committee.</br></br>Coming on the heels of the Labor Department's unexpectedly strong November job growth report on Friday, the purchasers' survey could exacerbate concern that the economy isn't cooling down as neatly or as notably as many economists thought. A too-strong economy raises worries that the Federal Reserve Board may curb credit in an effort to head off worrisome inflation.</br></br>The economy has been giving some mixed signals lately, and the purchasers' report also contains some disparate views. Mr. Bretz noted that the survey displayed "some signs of softening, particularly in the export order growth rate." But he added that "the continued healthy level of new orders, combined with a solid downtrend in the inflation rate, virtually assures a strong fourth quarter."
DALLAS, Aug. 13ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Sen.

After a sharp burst of inflation in the first three months of the year, much of it the result of the impact of bad weather on the cost of food and fuel, consumers got a bit of break last month when prices they pay rose only 0.2 percent, the Labor Department said yesterday.</br></br>Grocery store prices fell 0.7 percent, the first decline in more than two years, as dairy product and fruit and vegetable prices tumbled. Earlier in the year, fruit and vegetable prices had soared after December freezes had severely damaged crops in the South.</br></br>Few economists, however, expect such good price news to be repeated, in part because labor costs paid by private businesses are going up at roughly a 5 percent annual rate. "Wage increases are likely to sustain inflation for the rest of 1990," predicted economist Joel Popkin, an inflation expert who heads a Washington consulting firm. "It is hard to find a break in the inflation clouds."</br></br>Popkin expects consumer prices to be up 5.3 percent during 1990, compared with a 4.6 precent rise last year. A number of other economists believe prices may not go up quite that much this year, but only a handful believe the nation will do as well or better than it did in 1989.</br></br>Nevertheless, even Popkin believes the worst is over for this year. With the consumer price index already 2.3 percent higher than it was in December, prices can rise only 0.3 percent or 0.4 percent a month for the rest of the year if the rate for the entire year is to stay close to 5 percent.
NEW YORK -- Treasurys ended mixed as the market largely ignored signs of continued strength in manufacturing and instead looked ahead to tomorrow's monthly update on labor-market growth.</br></br>The 30-year Treasury bond fell 9/32 point, or $2.8125 for a bond with $1,000 face value, to 101 6/32. Its yield rose to 6.153% from 6.133% late Tuesday, as bond yields move inversely to prices. But shorter maturities ended higher. Prices of 10-year notes gained 6/32, for example.</br></br>The divergence stemmed from sales of 30-year bonds and purchases of other maturities -- so-called curve trades -- driven by wagers on how the market will be affected by the Treasury Department's planned buybacks of debt securities.</br></br>Dealers decided it was "the trade of the day," said Vinnie Verterano, director of government trading at Nomura Securities in New York.</br></br>Among economic reports during the session, the National Association of Purchasing Management's February business index -- a broad gauge of manufacturing-sector activity -- rose to 56.9 in February from 56.3 in January. A figure above 50 suggests an expansion of activity. An index in the NAPM report that tracks prices paid by manufacturers jumped to 74.1 from 72.6, indicating a substantial rise in price pressures during the month.
The unconventional measures introduced by many central banks in response to financial turmoil could create other problems if carried out for too long, the general manager of the Bank for International Settlements said Sunday.</br></br>Central banks currently find themselves "caught in the middle," Jaime Caruana said, "forced to be the policy makers of last resort."</br></br>They are providing monetary stimulus on a "massive scale," supplying liquidity to banks unable to fund themselves in markets and easing government financing burdens by keeping interest rates low, said Mr. Caruana, speaking in Basel, Switzerland, at the annual general meeting of the BIS, a consortium of the world's central banks.</br></br>"These emergency measures could have undesirable side effects if continued for too long," he said. "A worry is that monetary policy would be pressured to do still more because not enough action has been taken in other areas."</br></br>Mr. Caruana's comments come as central bankers from Beijing to Frankfurt to Washington come under renewed pressure to step up efforts to resuscitate the slowing global economy. Some economists and politicians--and some central bankers in the U.S. and the U.K.--argue that central banks are too hesitant, condemning their economies to slower growth and higher unemployment than necessary in the wake of the financial crisis.
Financial markets are reeling from too much good news. On Wednesday the Commerce Department released its flash estimate putting second-quarter real growth at a snappy 5.7% annual rate, and also revised the first-quarter estimate upward nearly a full point, to a soaring 9.7%. Bonds sank. Equities plunged, then rebounded to end the day with a gain.</br></br>Are the markets afraid of growth? Isn't growth what we want? Why this confusion and turmoil? Yes, we agree, no one wants inflation, but inflation is not caused by growth. Inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods, remember? And growth means more goods, remember? And just for the record, with the new growth figures naturally come new GNP deflators, showing inflation falling to a rate of 2.8% in the second quarter from 3.9% in the first.</br></br>To end the coyness, we understand perfectly well why the markets are in turmoil. The markets are not afraid of growth. The markets are afraid of the Federal Reserve Board.</br></br>We yield to no one in our admiration of Paul Volcker. If we had to pick one mortal on the face of the earth to run monetary policy out of his hip pocket, he would be our instant choice. But Chairman Volcker has to keep lecturing the markets about "overreacting" -- to the latest money supply figures, to his own statements, or to whatever else the market may settle on as a clue to whether he may ease or tighten. Just now, the markets have decided that the clue to Fed policy is real growth, and this overreaction sends them schizoid. They know growth is good, but worry that the Fed thinks that fine-tuning real growth is the key to controlling inflation. They worry that if growth comes in better than the economists' computers think it ought to, the Fed will feel impelled to stamp it out by tightening money.</br></br>Where would the markets get the notion the Fed might follow such a screwy theory? Well, just possibly the money managers have read the most recently released minutes of the Fed's Open Market Committee. At its March 26-27 meeting the FOMC voted to tighten, raising the target range of the federal funds rate to 7 1/2%-11 1/2% from the 6%-10% that had prevailed since November. Governors Henry Wallich and Lyle Gramley dissented on this vote because they wanted to tighten even more in view of "the strength of the economic expansion."
Affiliated Computer Services Inc., attempting to capitalize on the outsourcing of services by state and local governments, agreed to acquire Lockheed Martin Corp.'s IMS subsidiary for $825 million, company executives said.</br></br>Both boards have approved the transaction, which is expected to be announced this morning.</br></br>The deal is the largest acquisition by ACS, a Dallas company with $2 billion in revenue and 21,000 employees that was founded in 1988 and has become a leader in business-process outsourcing, handling back-office operations from processing health-insurance claims to loan and mortgage transactions. The sale is expected to generate as much as $550 million for Lockheed, Bethesda, Md.</br></br>IMS, with 4,800 employees, gets its roughly $580 million in annual revenue by performing a number of tasks for municipal and state government agencies, including administering welfare benefits, tracking down deadbeat dads and snaring red-light runners with strategically placed cameras. The unit is best known for operating E-Zpass, the electronic toll-collection service used by vehicles in the Northeast.</br></br>The acquisition bolsters ACS's position vying for government contracts against International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., and Electronic Data Systems Corp. of Plano, Texas. ACS gets about one-third of its revenue from the federal government but has been less competitive on state and local government work.
NEW YORK -- History repeats. You just don't expect it to repeat this quickly.</br></br>There are eerie parallels between this week's chaos in global financial markets and the dislocations of the 2008 financial crisis. Yet there are also significant differences, which investors, still smarting from past crisis, should bear in mind.</br></br>But first, the spooky stuff:</br></br>1. As a crisis trigger, Greece is analogous to the subprime mortgages market in 2007, since it also represents a relatively small, low-profile sector of its broader asset class.</br></br>When the Greek government first revised up its budget deficit estimates late last year, few predicted it would eventually put the entire euro zone at risk--much as few foresaw the initial subprime mortgage defaults threatening the entire U.S. financial system.
WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers peppered Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner with questions about the Obama administration's proposed overhaul of financial-markets supervision, underscoring how the revamp might become bogged down as it inches through Congress.</br></br>Speaking before the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, Mr. Geithner provided the first public defense of the proposal, warning that the country "cannot afford inaction" and must make broad changes to consumer protections and improve the everyday workings of financial markets.</br></br>"Our economy has been brought too close to the brink for us to let this moment pass," Mr. Geithner said before the panel.</br></br>The Treasury secretary faced questions about the White House's push to expand the authority of the Federal Reserve, the fate of finance companies owned by commercial firms, mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and financial literacy.</br></br>The role of the Fed was a flash point. Panel members expressed a strong desire for changes to the current regulatory system, but lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were wary of giving the Fed new and extensive powers to oversee risks across the financial system.
They're here.</br></br>After years of debate, tax-free "medical savings accounts" for the self-employed and people who work for small businesses finally arrived on New Year's Day.</br></br>Under a four-year pilot program, more than one million people could use MSAs to pay for routine health-care expenses in connection with special, high-deductible health-insurance policies. Money contributed to the accounts by workers or their employers would be used to pay for medical expenses until the deductible has been met and the insurance policies begin to pay.</br></br>MSAs also offer a potential new way for some people to boost their savings because money that isn't used for medical expenses can continue to grow tax-deferred.</br></br>Some insurers and banks are already pitching the accounts as a vehicle for long-term investing. In addition to supersafe cash or money-market accounts, they are offering mutual funds and, in some cases, individual stocks and bonds. The companies say they want to offer people investments with competitive returns in a tax-sheltered environment similar to an individual retirement account.
The industrialized economies are booming this year, and governments should be ready to hit the brakes if inflation shows signs of increasing, according to a report by the International Monetary Fund.</br></br>The outlook, prepared in mid-August, has been distributed to member governments but is not to be made public until later this month. A copy was obtained by the AP-Dow Jones News Service.</br></br>In its latest semiannual World Economic Outlook, the fund revised upward its estimate for the growth of economic activity in the industrialized world this year by a full percentage point, although the IMF economists say there is still little evidence of overheating.</br></br>The fund's economists now anticipate a real, or inflation-adjusted, growth rate of 3.8 percent for 1988, compared with the 2.8 percent increase projected in their April report.</br></br>They say the fast pace of the current expansion-at six years old, the longest since World War II-is likely to moderate in 1989 to 2.8 percent, up slightly from their April estimate of 2.6 percent.
The AFL-CIO, in a legal counter offensive against President Carterï¿½Ûªs anti-inflation program, filed suit in federal court here yesterday to bar the administration from penalizing violators of the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½voluntary" wage guidelines.</br></br>The huge{ ?labor federation, joined by nine affiliated unions with major contract negotiations this year, charged there is no basis in law for the administrationï¿½Ûªs only official sanction against violators: withholding federal contracts.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We believe that 'penaltiesï¿½Ûª for ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½violatorsï¿½Ûª clearly makes the wage controls mandatory and not voluntary,ï¿½Û said AFL-CIO President George Meany at a press conference to announce filing of the svdt, which was authorized by the federationï¿½Ûªs; executive council last month.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Since there is no statutory ~baMs for this action," Meany added,'ï¿½Û¢ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½we have asked the court for an injunction prohibiting the use of such tactics.ï¿½Û</br></br>If the case,, which was assigned to U.S. District Court Judge Barrington Parker, results in a victory for the AFL-CIO. the administration would be free to seek voluntary compliance with its program .ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ but without any penalties for violators unless they are enacted by Congress. The AFL-CIO ha<jl. advocated congressional enactment of across-the-board controls on the whole economy.
The Dow industrials jumped 119.01 points to 13357.74, down slightly for the week but up 1.1% for the month. New economic data, which showed that a key inflation measure remained tame in July, and a speech by Bernanke fueled hopes that the Fed will cut rates. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both ended August higher.</br></br>The Fed won't bail investors out of bad decisions but will act if recent market turmoil threatens economic growth, Bernanke said in a much-anticipated speech.</br></br>---</br></br>Starwood named Coors Brewing CEO Frits van Paasschen as its new chief, hoping his experience managing brands can help propel the hotel company.</br></br>---
A wave of indignation swept over France when it became known Tuesday that the head of a large auto parts company who was edged out because of poor results walked away with a severance package worth more than $4 million.</br></br>The outrage, which intensified government threats to pass a law limiting executive pay, reflected a growing sense of unease as the global financial crisis bites ever more deeply into the French economy, with unemployment surpassing 2 million and recrimination mounting against President Nicolas Sarkozy's attempt to remedy the situation by propping up ailing banks and businesses.</br></br>As it has in the United States, the issue of stratospheric compensation packages for executives who were in charge when the crisis erupted has become a rallying cry for fired workers, labor unions and politicians. Many French people, like their U.S. counterparts, have complained they are being made to pay for the greed and heedlessness shown by political and business leaders who allowed world financial markets to spin out of control.</br></br>Aware of the mounting resentment and its political implications, the government was quick to react when news spread that Thierry Morin, who left the Valeo company Monday, received a $4.1 million goodbye gift from the board of directors. The package was granted, the newspaper Liberation reported, even though the company lost more than $250 million last year, laid off about 1,600 employees in France and received nearly $25 million in government aid to weather the crisis.</br></br>The budget minister, Eric Woerth, said it was "provocative" and "abnormal" for a struggling company that received aid from the government -- and in which the government has a minority interest -- to pay out such a generous severance package to someone who was let go over what were described as "strategic differences" with the board of directors.

NEW YORK -- American Brands Inc., already a leading seller of golf balls, has agreed to acquire Cobra Golf Inc., the maker of King Cobra clubs, for $700 million.</br></br>News of American Brands' agreement to pay $36 a share sent Cobra shares soaring 29%, or $7.875, to $35.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, while American Brands shares closed down 4.9%, or $2.25, to $44.125 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</br></br>The combination of the maker of the Titleist golf clubs and balls and Foot-Joy gloves and shoes with the maker of oversized and graphite-shaft golf clubs ends months of speculation that American Brands planned to buy a premium club maker. Cobra or Callaway Golf Co., the maker of the Big Bertha brand, were the likely targets. Callaway was off 5%, or $1, to $19 a share in Big Board composite trading.</br></br>Over the past year, American Brands has been restructuring its operations, selling off its domestic tobacco and insurance units for $2.2 billion to focus on its brandname businesses. In addition to its sporting good business, American Brands products include Jim Beam and Old Grand-Dad bourbons, hardware and home improvement brands of Moen faucets and Master Locks, and Day-Timer and Swingline office products.</br></br>Nonetheless, the golf business has been one of its fastest growing operations, said Thomas C. Hays, American Brands' chairman and chief executive officer, with Titleist showing "superb, sustained growth" over the past few years. The unit now contributes about 9%, or $79.1 million, of American Brands total operating profit of $843.2 million for the first nine months.
MCI WorldCom Inc., fueled by growth in Internet traffic, data and old-fashioned phone calls, beat analysts' earnings expectations for the first quarter as revenue grew a healthy 15%.</br></br>But shares of the Jackson, Miss., telecommunications company continued to drop amid uncertainty over whether MCI WorldCom will make a bid for Nextel Communications Inc., the nation's last major independent wireless company.</br></br>MCI WorldCom remains in talks with Nextel about a potential acquisition, but the two sides are said to be deadlocked over price. MCI WorldCom officials are reportedly growing concerned about the fall in their company's stock price as the talks continue. MCI WorldCom shares have lost more than 10% in value since April 12. On the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday, MCI closed at $83.875, down $3.8125.</br></br>MCI WorldCom had net income of $709 million, or 37 cents a diluted share, compared with pro forma earnings of $191 million, or 10 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.</br></br>Excluding MCI WorldCom's 19% interest in Brazil's Embratel Participacoes SA and a one-time gain, the company had operating earnings of $688 million, or 36 cents a share, compared with the yearearlier pro forma results of $169 million, or 10 cents a share. Analysts had expected operating earnings of 34 cents a share, according to a consensus compiled by First Call Corp.
NEW YORK -- Technology issues fell again and consumer names retreated as investors interpreted the Federal Reserve decision to cut interest rates again as a signal that economic trends remain weak.</br></br>A host of telecommunications-gear makers fell during trading. Communications-chip maker Broadcom shed $4.73, or 13%, to $33.06 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Optical-equipment maker JDS Uniphase, which hit a 52-week low Monday, fell further, dropping 44 cents, or 5.9%, to 7.07. Cellphone-chip maker RF Micro Devices slid 2.02, or 7.9%, to 23.54. Storage-software developer Brocade Communications retreated 1.60, or 5.9%, to 25.47. All trade on Nasdaq.</br></br>The weakness came after the Federal Reserve voted to lower interest rates to 3.5% from 3.75%, marking the central bank's seventh rate cut this year.</br></br>Market averages, which had moved slightly higher, albeit in thin trading, ahead of the release of the Fed's decision, veered lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index finished down 50.05, or 2.7%, at 1831.30, the lowest the index has finished since April 9. Technical analyst Peter Green of Gerard Klauer Mattison speculated the Nasdaq composite could fall another 4% during the short term, given the recent technical patterns.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 145.93 points, a 1.4% drop, at 10174.14, its lowest finish since April 12.
Here's one message that college seniors won't hear from graduation speakers: "higher education" is a mess. We have plenty of superb colleges and universities, and many students get excellent educations. But on the whole, our colleges are educationally undemanding and economically wasteful. They are a symptom of low educational standards-and a main cause.</br></br>The attrition rate among college students is enormous. Of entering freshmen at four-year colleges, only 41 percent have earned a bachelor's degree after six years. At community colleges, the dropout rate appears to be even higher.</br></br>Two-thirds of college faculty members say their schools increasingly teach what students should have learned in high school. Students don't disagree. About 40 percent of incoming freshmen say a main reason for going to college is to improve "reading and study skills." In 1971, 22 percent said so.</br></br>The value of many degrees is suspect. Nearly 30 percent of bachelors' degrees are in "business" or "communications"-double the rate of 20 years ago. In general, these degrees don't make significant intellectual demands on students or provide important technical skills (such as engineering).</br></br>Our college and university leaders are aware of their problems, but few discuss them candidly. Derek Bok, the president of Harvard, recently wrote a 15,000-word report on U.S. higher education without mentioning any of the facts listed above. College leaders see themselves as the victims of poor high schools. This rationalization is at least half backward.
Investors caught their breath after an eight-day Wall Street rampage, pushing stocks down and bonds up in what many traders viewed as a temporary pause in the stock rally.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 77.50, or 0.86%, to 8897.96. Sharp gains by technology stocks including Dell Computer and Internet-related stocks pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index up 4.49, or 0.24%, to 1861.05.</br></br>Treasury bonds bounced back after taking a beating during last week's push toward stocks, and the dollar gained. The 30-year bellwether Treasury bond gained 1 13/32, or $14.0625 per $1,000 bond, pulling the yield (which moves opposite to the price) back to 5.288%. The bond market and most banks are closed tomorrow for Veterans Day, although the stock market remains open.</br></br>"It was a light-volume day where you just saw some profit-taking in stocks," said Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at PaineWebber.</br></br>William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, noted that bond investors worried last week that the Federal Reserve might not cut interest rates this month; he said that worry spread to stock investors this week.
Israel is the largest single recipient of economic aid from the U.S. This is partly because the economic stability of Israel is uncertain and is important to U.S. national interests. Therefore a report on the progress of the Israeli economy is relevant to policy decisions to be made here.</br></br>A common view, supported by some experience, is that the availability of foreign aid prevents the recipient country from taking the steps required for its own economic health. The story of Israel suggests that there may be exceptions to this dismal lesson.</br></br>On July 1, 1985, Israel introduced a radical stabilization program designed to bring the inflation rate down from 1000% to 20% a year or less. Success was swift. Within two months inflation was down to less than 4% a month; in November and December 1985 it averaged only 1% a month. But there is still a long way to go before success is assured.</br></br>The Israeli inflation rate rose by stages from 2% per annum in 1967-70 to the 1000%-per-annum area at the end of 1984. The pattern was for an inflationary shock to kick the inflation rate up to a new plateau, at which it stabilized before the next shock.</br></br>Underlying the Israeli inflation were massive budget deficits averaging 15% of gross national product for more than a decade, fueling, and fueled by, a fast-growing national debt and rapid monetary growth. At the heart of the government's budget problem is defense spending of 25% of GNP. Despite large-scale U.S. aid, the government found it increasingly difficult to borrow at home or abroad in 1984 and 1985, and was forced instead to print money. More than anything else, it was the difficulty of borrowing that forced the government to undertake the stabilization program.
Stocks plunged today as optimism about corporate earnings gave way to jitters about rising interest rates and their impact on profit growth.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 243.54 points to close at 11,008.17, its biggest loss since Jan. 4, when it fell 359 points. The sell-off was broad-based, with 27 of 30 Dow component stocks finishing lower. General Electric, down 6 at 138 1/8, and Johnson & Johnson, down 6-3/16 at 83-11/16, led the decline.</br></br>Broader stock indicators also fell in a volatile session. The Nasdaq plummeted 139.32 points to close at 4096.08, its worst point drop since it fell 150 points on Jan. 5, and its fourth-biggest point decline ever. The Nasdaq had risen 67 points in early trading.</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock average fell 39.45, to 1401.91, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell for the first time since Jan. 12, dropping 10.99, to 522.95.</br></br>After a strong opening, stocks began to slide at midday as investors looked ahead to the next meeting of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1-2. Many people on Wall Street now fear that an interest rate increase at that meeting will be the first of several this year as the central bank works to stave off inflation.
TOKYO -- Japanese stocks pulled back yesterday, as uncertainty over the downfall of corporate financier Yoshiaki Murakami and declines in U.S. stocks from Friday prompted profit-taking in pricey blue-chip shares such as Toyota Motor, Canon and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial.</br></br>But many of the stocks in Mr. Murakami's fund rose, after falling sharply on Friday on fears the fund might sell off its shares.</br></br>The Nikkei Stock Average dropped 121 points, or 0.8%, to 15668.31 following a 285.57-point rally on Friday.</br></br>Most investors said the effect likely would be limited on the overall Tokyo stock market from the Murakami scandal. But some also said they want to see foreign investors' reactions to the news. Mr. Murakami, who leads the so-called Murakami Fund, admitted yesterday that he had violated the country's insider-trading laws, and would step away from his own fund and investments.</br></br>Yesterday, the home for many of the Murakami stocks of start-up companies, the TSE Mothers market, saw its index rise 3.4% to 1393.86, but it is still down about 50% from its year high of 2799.06 in January. Among the stocks in which the Murakami fund holds a major stake, Matsuzakaya, Sumitomo Warehouse, GMO Internet and New Japan Radio all rose.
The D.C. Council is preparing some of the nation's strictest regulations against bullying in public schools and public buildings. Readers gave a range of responses on PostLocal.com. savkobabe: You only have to stand up for yourself one time and the bullying stops.</br></br>lwilliamson1: It amazes me how people these days act as if bullying is some sort of a new phenomenon, when, in truth, it's been around for ages - it's just human nature.</br></br>I think . . . at some point in our lives, we all have had to confront a bully. Traditionally, there has been only one way to resolve this traditional problem: Kids have to stand up to a bully and fight back, because bullies, after all, thrive on cowardice and fold in the face of courage and strength.</br></br>[The District school system] needs to overhaul its general discipline policies and practices. That's how you deal with bullying, not by passing a law that addresses only one form of behavioral problem.</br></br>zcxnissan: Parenting and teaching can control bullies from developing - not that this policy will have any effect on bullying, since it is human nature. Government should stay out of this.
[Today's Market Forecast]</br></br>What's Down, Doc?</br></br>Economists keep talking about things being "on hold." It's increasingly looking as if they mean it in the Wile E. Coyote sense of being frozen just after he's run off the cliff.</br></br>After the huge payroll drop on Friday of 308,000 jobs, cages were rattled. The unemployment rate ticked up only a tenth of a percentage point to 5.8%, but that understates the weakness in the labor market. For more texture to how bad a jobs market it is, look at the conference board survey, the Manpower survey, the employment component of the ISM index and the four-week moving average of weekly jobless claims. All point in the same foreboding direction.</br></br>Merrill Lynch's David Rosenberg said GDP growth in the first quarter looks as if it will barely be 1% and now expects the Fed to cut rates a quarter point at both the March 18 and the May 6 meetings. To that prospect, investors will have the worrying thought: Been there, but that done squat.
WASHINGTON -- The economy is still quite healthy, but it has shown enough evidence of slowing down to ease concerns about overheating.</br></br>Consumer spending has ebbed, and housing activity and car sales have</br></br>slowed since interest rates increased.

Continuing the resurgence of technology retailers in a complex market, CDW Corp. late yesterday said it agreed to be acquired by Chicago buyout firm Madison Dearborn Partners LLC.</br></br>Madison Dearborn, of Chicago, agreed to acquire CDW for about $7.3 billion, or $87.75 a share. The purchase price represents a 16% premium to CDW's closing stock price of $75.56 a share Friday. CDW shares were up $7.55, or 10%, at $83.11 yesterday in 4 p.m. Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading.</br></br>CDW said its board has approved the deal and said it will urge shareholders to approve the acquisition, which is expected to close near the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.</br></br>Before approving the agreement, CDW said its board conducted an auction process in which a number of potential bidders participated. Under the agreement, CDW will solicit proposals from third parties during the next 30 days, with the assistance of its financial adviser, Morgan Stanley, a move common in private-equity deals. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s J.P Morgan Securities Inc. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. advised Madison Dearborn.</br></br>CDW is one of the country's largest resellers of computers, software and related equipment, primarily for large corporations and the government. Founded in 1984, CDW reported net income of $266.1 million on sales of $6.79 billion last year.
I live in one of those neighborhoods where watching house prices leap-frog is a major spectator sport.</br></br>Every new "For Sale" sign is an economic indicator. Every open house is another ticket in a lottery where every buyer wins. Every moving van is a validation of the investment wisdom that led to the purchase of a white-washed cottage that's now worth 10 times what it cost to build. Even today, my neighborhood inflation rate regularly runs in the orange and red zone of the real estate section's monthly map of price changes, up 10, 20 percent or more annually at a time when many markets are stalling out.</br></br>But the days when all the owners celebrated each incremental increase in the value of their houses are over. The talk these days is "tax revolt." A guy down the block is organizing the oppressed owners of $300,000 and $400,000 houses against the tyranny of taxes that are escalating along with home prices.</br></br>The property tax system was pretty much okay with most people as long as they didn't have too much property to be taxed. They accepted the principle of taxing property and the corollary that if you're going to base levies on people's accumulated wealth, you have to keep close track of how much wealth they have accumulated by regularly reassessing their property.</br></br>Now, however, folks who would never fudge a nickel on their 1040 forms have decided that equally accurate assessments of their property values are outrageous. Stunned by 60, 70 and 80 percent jumps in assessed values of their houses-and corresponding increases in property taxes-they're demanding a limit to assessment increases. No more than 15 percent a year is the rallying cry of the Montgomery County property tax revolutionaries.
SPRINGFIELD, Mass., Nov. 26 (IP).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Industrialist Roger Lowell Putnam, thrice Springfield mayor, who was named Economic Stabilization Administrator tonight pledged himself to fight inflation.</br></br>Putnam said the United Statesï¿½Ûª economic stability ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is the staff on which the whole free world leans for security in these troubled times. It is my job to keep this staff strong so that We in America may be the guiding light for freedom everywhere.ï¿½Û</br></br>When informed President Truman had named him to the post to succeed Eric Johnston, Putnam said: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Thatï¿½Ûªs very interestingï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Iï¿½Ûªm glad to hear it.ï¿½Û*</br></br>Putnam, prominent Democrat and president of the Package Machinery Co., at East Long-meadow, Mass., said he 4fkind of had the ideaï¿½Û he would get the job. He said he had conferred about the position with Mobilization Director Charles E. Wilson.</br></br>Mr. Truman gave Putnam a recess appointment, effective December T. Johnson resigned last week to return to his post as motion picture czar.
At an unusual seminar last week sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute, all three members of the Council of Economic Advisers, along with the undersecretary of Treasury for tax and economic affairs, Norman Ture, discussed the Reagan administrationï¿½Ûªs economic policies, especially the issue of budget deficits. Some of the remarks of CEA Chairman Murray Weiden-baum and members William Niska-nen and Jerry Jordonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that deficits are not necessarily bad for the economyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½challenged the Republican orthodoxy. The statements raised hackles in Congress and at the White House where official spokesmen reiterated that President Reagan is very much concerned about deficits, which internal administration estimates now place at more than $100 billion for 1982 and, in the absence of spending cuts or tax increases, at more than $150 billion in 1983 and $160 billion in 1984.</br></br>Several AEI economists, including former CEA chairman Herbert Stein, former member William Fell-ner and Rudy Pen tier, former chief economist for the Office of Management and Budget, questioned the administration officials closely and disagreed with some of what the Reagan advisers had to say. Other economists and members of the press were in the audience.</br></br>Ture: ... I think there can be no question about the fact that the [Federal Reserve] and the people in the administration are of a single mind about the desirability of restricting the growth of monetary ag- gregates to rates and proportions that are consistent with a continually declining rate of increase in the overall level of prices.</br></br>. What should we look for as the consequences of a successful pursuit of that policy? . . . The old conventional wisdom . . . says if you restrict the rate of increase in the price level you must, necessarily, reduce employment and therefore total output in real terms as well. That is a judgment which I think is not well-founded either in analysis or in the empirical record, and it is a line of reasoning which, I think, has no part at all in the framing out of the economic policy and strategies of this administration .. .</br></br>there will be lags in the effectiveness of anti-inflation policy [because] cost trends do not adjust instantaneously. . . (and] because there is a credibility problem. The credibility, I think, is being gained now by the Fed and I think that people take their posture very much more seriously than they did in the beginning. . . .There is a dilemma [of long-term cost agreements] which is likely to lead to some slowing and indeed to carry this system through a recession before it really gets on a path of healthy growth . . . and I would expect through a slower recovery than that which we would have if we were willing to accept the rekindling of inflation . . .
Stocks today diverged in familiar fashion, with technology shares leading the Nasdaq composite index higher for a sixth straight session while blue-chip industrials slumped.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 58.01, to 10,905.79, and the Standard & Poor's 500 slipped 0.13, to 1424.24.</br></br>The Nasdaq, dominated by technology stocks, has risen nearly 6 percent so far this year, while the blue-chip Dow industrial average has fallen more than 5 percent.</br></br>"It's a very fragmented market, and you can understand why," said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.</br></br>General Electric, down 5-1/16 at 136 1/2, and Boeing, down 2-3/16 at 41-13/16, contributed most to the Dow's decline.
The past two months have been punishing ones for investors in "high yield," or junk-bond, funds.</br></br>After a few years in which these funds outstripped most other types of bond funds, they have recently fallen hard, in step with the stock market. Some other bond funds, by contrast, have eked out recent gains that partly offset investors' stock-market pain.</br></br>The recent performance of junk bonds shouldn't be any surprise to investors familiar with the odd hybrid nature of below-investment-grade bonds. "Sometimes these securities trade with the general bond market and sometimes they trade with the stock market," says Earl McEvoy, manager of Vanguard Fixed-Income Securities High-Yield Fund. Lately, it's been much closer to the stock market.</br></br>But "too often," Mr. McEvoy says, investors assume a high-yield fund is simply that -- "just another bond fund with a higher yield." In a period like the past several weeks -- when stock prices tumbled but government-bond prices rose -- he says investors may assume mistakenly that their junk-bond funds are comfortably holding their ground.</br></br>That certainly hasn't been the case. Since the stock-market peak on July 17, Lipper Analytical Services Inc.'s high-yield fund index has posted a negative 9.0% return. That's not as bad as the performance of most stock funds, such as the 15.7% decline for the Lipper Growth Fund Index. But it is sharply worse than the positive 3.1% return on a Lipper index of government-bond funds and a positive 2.0% return on its index of funds holding high-quality (A-rated) corporate bonds.
LAST WEEK the president of General Motors Corp. reduced his forecast of 1956 automobile production by 15 per</br></br>LAST WEEK the president of General Motors Corp. reduced his forecast of 1956 automobile production by 15 per cent and seemed to place much of the blame for lower automo-.bile sales on the restrictive credit policies of the Federal Reserve Board. Certain facts suggest that he picked the wrong' "whipping boy"; the real culprit may be the automobile industry itself, and/or the fickle public.</br></br>Personal Disposable Income (after taxes) in the first quarter of this year showed a $16.1 billion (6.2 per cent) increase over the first quarter of last year, but an analysis of personal expenditures shows that, either by choice or by necessity, this increase in purchasing power was channeled to uses other than the purchase of automobiles,</br></br>In the first place, it is difficult to see how there could be any quarrel with a $16 billion increase in personal purchasing power, whether or not one chooses to criticize credit policies, An increase of that size is one of the best annual gains on record. Nor, do we see any reason to believe that credit policies had much influence on the. publicï¿½Ûªs use of this increased purchasing power.</br></br>It so happened that the public decided that it wanted to spend $4.3 billion (annual rate) more for food and beverages in the first quarter of this year than it did a year earlier. So 27 per cent of the splendid increase in purchasing power was absorbed for these items.
When the Federal Reserve Board moved to curb inflation by boosting interest rates this year, shudders ran through Wall Street. Stock and bond prices plunged, and it was widely assumed that borrowers and savers across the country would soon be seeing higher rates.</br></br>So far, the conventional wisdom has not proven true. Although mortgage rates jumped sharplyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½because they are tied to the Wall Street capi- tal marketsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½many of the rates that banks pay to depositors or charge for ] consumer loans have remained steady or risen only slightly.</br></br>The reason is market conditions in , the banking industry. Competition to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ attract loan customers has kept down rates charged for auto and other , loans.</br></br>And banks have so much money ' available that they do not have to ï¿½Û¢ raise rates paid to customers to at- * tract depositors.	'</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½It's an interesting sort of situation. The rules of thumb you would have used [in the past] to look at bank pricing donï¿½Ûªt seem to be holding," said Alfred Smith, principal economist at NationsBank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. The prime rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which banks charge their best customersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½has clicked upward a quarter of a point, taking with it certain types of loans that are tied to it, notably home equity lines of credit. But a quick check of banks here and in other parts of the country shows that the reaction on other loan and deposit products has been mild so far.
The United States has a long and demanding list of reforms it wants the World Bank and the regional development banks to adopt. It is also the only donor that fails to pay its bills.</br></br>Last year Congress cut the administration's funding request so that U.S. arrearages more than doubled, to $850 million. It may cut again this year, while still aggressively demanding change. Its motto for the banks seems to be: "Listen to what I say, not what I pay."</br></br>If Congress doesn't feel the discord in these two positions, others do. Anyone who spends much time at the banks has his or her tale to tell of building resentment and opposition to American-pushed reforms, including from countries that share our goals.</br></br>The empire won't fall over a few insults and failed proposals. If we believed that the World Bank didn't serve American interests or that there were better uses for that money, it might make sense to push and pull back. But, in fact, over decades, few dollars have as efficiently served American economic and political interests, and American values, as have its relatively small contributions - $2 billion proposed this year - to these institutions.</br></br>Funding the banks ought to be a no-brainer on purely selfish grounds, because we get back in procurement contracts for U.S. companies a great deal more than we pay in. Last year the figures were $1.5 billion in contributions and $2.7 billion in contracts. Unfortunately for the banks, the bonus is no inducement because we've been getting the contracts without paying the bill.
In the editorial-page pieces "Nixon's Worst Weekend" (Aug. 15) and "My Price-Control Days With Nixon" (Aug. 16), Robert L. Bartley and Herbert Stein, respectively, paint a fascinating picture of the fateful economic decisions 20 years ago that led to the closing of the gold window and the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement. For better or worse, this chain of events greatly influenced the world economies of the past two decades.</br></br>The largest lesson, correctly identified by Mr. Stein, is that the free marketplace found means to cope with these enormous economic changes. The first innovation -- the International Monetary Market in currency futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange -- will celebrate its 20th anniversary next spring.</br></br>Come to Chicago today and you will see a major growth industry in financial risk management. With 130,000 related jobs and influence in financial capitals around the world, the futures and options business here has filled a dire need for managing risk-inflation, volatile interest rates, fluctuating exchange rates. "Nixon's Worst Weekend" was only the opening scene in a changed, shrinking and information technology-driven world that created not only risk, but also opportunity. The sequel is that, since 1982, global financial centers such as London, Paris, Tokyo, Osaka, Singapore, Hong Kong and Frankfurt have established futures and options exchanges modeled on the example of the Chicago exchanges.</br></br>With the luxury of hindsight, history inevitably judges policy decisions. As for the financial risks endemic to these decisions, they can be hedged with futures and options.</br></br>John F. Sandner
STOCKS SUFFERED their second 100-point decline in three trading days as the long rally lost some momentum and investors took more profits before the quarter ends.</br></br>With the year not even half over, many money managers were showing bigger gains than they had expected for the full year. Since the outlook for the economy and corporate earnings remains uncertain, some sold stocks to lock in profits.</br></br>"We had 16 weeks of rally," said Brian Pears, head stock trader at Victory Capital Management, the money-management arm of KeyCorp in Cleveland. "The market is a little tired here and it feels as if a period of consolidation is going to be necessary before the market takes the next step."</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was above 9300 a week ago, fell 127.80 points, or 1.39%, to 9072.95, its sharpest one-day decline in more than a month. That followed a 114-point decrease Thursday. Although the blue-chip average remains above 9000, the two declines left some investors worried the rally has lost its momentum.</br></br>Treasury bonds, which had been in a slump last week, rebounded sharply as some investors moved money toward bonds ahead of the Federal Reserve monetary-policy meeting today and tomorrow. Analysts expect the Fed to stimulate the economy by cutting its target short-term interest rate by a quarter- or half-point, to its lowest level in 45 years.
AuthorAffiliation Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</br></br>During the 1990-91 recession, when layoffs were announced almost every day, workers around the nation were angry and anxious. Their employers talked about a tough new world in which global competition and technological change required constant leanness, but most employees assumed that the layoffs would stop when the good times returned.</br></br>They were wrong.</br></br>While corporate profits were surging to record levels last year, the number of job cuts approached those seen at the height of the recession. Corporate profits rose 11% in 1994, after a 13% rise in 1993, according to DRI/McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., economic consultant. Meanwhile, corporate America cut 516,069 jobs in 1994, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas in Chicago. That is far more than in the recession year of 1990, when 316,047 jobs were eliminated, and close to the 1991 total of 555,292 jobs.</br></br>Among the profitable companies now in the midst of layoffs: Procter & Gamble Co., American Home Products Corp., Sara Lee Corp. and Banc One Corp.
An unexpected Christmas shopping spree gave merchants their biggest Christmas sales gains in nearly a decade, providing new evidence that the United States is rapidly recovering from last yearï¿½Ûªs recession.</br></br>Sears, Roebuck & Co., the nationï¿½Ûªs biggest retailer, reported its December sales jumped 17.5 percent and virtually all other big chains reported double digit sales gainsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½despite December storms that kept some shoppers at home.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This was the best Christmas in eight to 10 years,ï¿½Û said Terence J. McEvoy, an analyst who follows retailing for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The question is how much better it would have been if the weather had been decent.ï¿½Û</br></br>In the Washington area, sales gains were as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½spectacularï¿½Û as in the rest of the nation, said an official with the Greater Washington Board of Trade, which collects confidential sales figures from local stores. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Some stores posted 20 percent increases and many were in the 15-to-20 percent range. I havenï¿½Ûªt found anybody who was below the 10 percent range,ï¿½Û the official said.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Even more significant, there hasnï¿½Ûªt been any post-Christmas letdown. Customers are still in the store buying and sales have continued very strong,ï¿½Û he added.
President Reagan put a high glossï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½He comes home in triumphï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½on Secretary of State Alexander Haigï¿½Ûªs work at the NATO meeting. No doubt Haig deserved it. Working under pressure, he gave the allies the assurances they demanded of American readiness to negotiate with Moscow on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe, and he got the allies to go along with some tough Reagan-style talk about Soviet global conduct.</br></br>I fear, however, that the Haig performance, though a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½triumphï¿½Û of sorts, was ephemeral and perhaps even deceptive. It came about against the better judgment of the administrationï¿½Ûªs dominant national security figures, headed by President Reagan, and will not be easily sustained.</br></br>Check the fine print of the NATO communique;, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The allies welcomed the intention of the U.S. to begin negotiations with the Soviet Union on Theater Nuclear . Forces arms controlï¿½Ûï¿½ï¿½ï¿½except the sentence didnï¿½Ûªt end there. It ended this way: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½on Theater Nuclear Forces arms control within the SALT framework.ï¿½Û</br></br>Thereï¿½Ûªs the rub. There is no SALT frameworkï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no framework within which to negotiate with Moscow, not just on European ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½theaterï¿½Û weapons but also on the weapons in the two great powersï¿½Ûª central systems. Reagan has set aside the old framework but has not approached Moscow to construct a new one.</br></br>To promise to negotiate on European nuclear arms ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½within the SALT frameworkï¿½Û is to throw a curve. It puts the United States in a posture of earnestness and permits the European allies to teil their anxious publics that, since the new administration is ready to move on the first track of a 1979 NATO decision to negotiate on limiting nukes in Europe, the Europeans should go ahead on the second track of preparing to deploy those nukes, starting two years hence. But if there is no SALT framework, there can be no real negotiations over nukes based in Europe. The Europeans are bound to catch on.
ROSWELL, Ga. -- The waiting list for subsidized housing here, just 40 families long a year ago, is up to 500. The number of children eligible for free or reduced lunch is up 50%. A little more than a year ago, the Methodist church began seminars for marriages strained by job losses.</br></br>Roswell is a pre-Civil War cotton mill town that grew into a wealthy bedroom community of Atlanta as the metro area prospered. More than half the city's 88,000 residents have four-year college degrees. But Roswell sits in a region with an unusually severe case of long-term unemployment: About 40% of the unemployed in the Atlanta metro area in 2010, the most recent local data available, were out of work for a year or more versus the national average of 29%.</br></br>One of them is Marcy Bronner, 57 years old. When she lost her job at Pennzoil back in 2000, it took her seven months to find a new one at Quintiles, a bio- and pharmaceutical-services company. She eventually became senior director of human resources at a salary in the low six figures.</br></br>In November 2010, she was laid off again. More than a year later, she is still looking for work. "It's harder now," she says, compared to the 2000s. "There's a lot more people out there."</br></br>While the job market is improving -- the national unemployment rate fell to 8.5% in December -- long-term unemployment continues to be particularly pronounced, and there is little indication that it is falling quickly. The government said that in December 3.9 million nationwide had been out of work for at least a year and were still looking. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has called this "a national crisis."
TOKYO, Jan. 15 (Tuesday)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Taiwan, one of the world's largest holders of foreign exchange reserves, has reduced much of its holdings in U.S. commercial banks because of its concerns that a Persian Gulf war could exacerbate recession and bank problems in the United States, according to Taiwanese press reports.</br></br>Some of the island nationï¿½Ûªs reserves have been moved to accounts at the U.S. Federal Reserve System and some to banks in Europe, Japan and Australia, the reports said.</br></br>In a telephone interview, Samuel Shieh, governor of Taiwanï¿½Ûªs central bank, said the central bankï¿½Ûªs actions have involved nothing more than "routineï¿½Û transfers of funds. But Peng Hui Nan, director general of the foreign exchange division, was quoted by the China Times as saying that the central bank had ï¿½Ûªï¿½Ûªadjustedï¿½Û its reserves deposited in U.S. bank because of the threat of war and U.S. economic problems.</br></br>Central bank officials reportedly said that of Taiwanï¿½Ûªs $73 billion in reserves, about $35 billion has been moved from U.S. commercial banks since late 1990, and only small amounts are now being kept in those banks to maintain business relations.</br></br>Such a shift would appear to represent a surprising vote of no confidence in the U.S. financial system.
Baseball players are said to peak in their late 20s. Chess players in their mid-30s. Theoretical economists in their mid-40s.</br></br>But in ordinary life, there's an obvious tension between sheer smarts, often seen in the supple minds of the young -- and experience, which comes only with age.</br></br>Which one is more valuable in making personal-finance decisions?</br></br>A quartet of economists think they have found an answer. In looking at which consumers get stuck paying those pesky credit-card fees, the economists noticed a puzzling pattern: Younger and older consumers were more likely than others to get hit with easily avoided fees. So the economists expanded their inquiry to loans and other products, and sifted through records of tens of thousands of consumers.</br></br>They found that middle-aged adults tend to borrow at lower interest rates and pay fewer fees than younger and older adults. The age at which consumers are least likely to make financial mistakes: a few months past their 53rd birthday, despite all the pressures that accompany middle age.
NEW YORK -- The Nasdaq Stock Market, by some measures, is having a great year. Day after day, trading volume and indexes tracking the market's technology stocks have hit records.</br></br>But for Nasdaq itself, which likes to bill itself as the tech market for tech companies, all that volume and the technology needed to keep up with it have been double-edged swords.</br></br>The 17-minute outage of key Nasdaq trade-reporting and order-routing systems Tuesday not only crippled the market in the half-hour leading up to the 4 p.m. EST close -- it also resulted in incorrect day-end values for the Nasdaq Composite Index and for certain individual stocks, including six of the vigorously traded Nasdaq 100-index tech stocks.</br></br>The Nasdaq Composite's actual finish Tuesday was 3295.52, not 3293.05 as reported in many news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal. The index ended yesterday at 3269.39, down 26.13, on record volume of 1.65 billion shares. There were delays in morning trading, but they were less severe than Tuesday's problems.</br></br>While Wall Street traders said Tuesday's shutdown was the worst of the recent problems, they also said it wasn't the first problem they'd experienced with Nasdaq's technology and in particular with SelectNet, the heavily trafficked e-mail system used to send orders and report trades. SelectNet problems, they say, have gone on for months and are particularly pronounced on days like Tuesday when volumes surge.
A Maryland governor's task force will recommend that the state give an extra $22 million to the University of Maryland at College Park over the next two years and guarantee at least $5,000 in funds per student to each of the University of Maryland system's 13 campuses.</br></br>In a report to be delivered to Gov. Parris N. Glendening (D) next month, the panel will urge the Maryland Higher Education Commission and the University System of Maryland to create a statewide funding strategy for higher education that will help College Park realize its intended status as flagship and set mandatory minimum funding levels for the system's colleges and universities, which saw state funding stagnate during the recession of the early 1990s.</br></br>The funding guarantees will "give university presidents a built- in, reliable component to their budgets . . . so they can project what {programs} they can take care of," said Del. Nancy K. Kopp (D- Montgomery), the task force co-chairman.</br></br>The task force's recommendations recognize College Park's need for additional funds to compete for staff and students with top-ranked public universities elsewhere.</br></br>When the University System of Maryland was created in 1988, lawmakers called for an increase of $20 million a year for College Park from 1990 to 1995 to put it on par with top public universities in California, North Carolina, Michigan and Illinois.
The University of Virginia, prompted by the nationwide phenomena of grade inflation, lias tightened the requirement for membership on its Deanï¿½Ûªs List of Distinguished Students.</br></br>The faculty of the universityï¿½Ûªs College of Arts and Sciences voted at a regular meeting last week to raise the grade point average for studentsï¿½Ûª qualifying for the deanï¿½Ûªs list from 3.0 to 3.4 out of a possible 4,0. The change becomes effective for the fall semester next year.</br></br>Due to easier grading by professors in Charlottesville, as at other universities around the country, more and more students have qualified for the deanï¿½Ûªs list in recent years.</br></br>Last spring, 55 per cent of the 0,827 undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Sciences qualified for the list. Last January, 65.3 per cent of the 7,029 students in the college were named to the list ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The list had become fairly meaningless as It was constituted,ï¿½Û said Dr. Irby B. Cauthen Jr., dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.</br></br>Under the tightened deanï¿½Ûª* list standards, Cauthen estimated only about 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the students in the college would qualify.
WASHINGTON -- Top U.S. financial regulators are expected to recommend that hedge funds disclose their portfolios' financial condition in quarterly filings that are available to the public, but they fell short of proposing broad new rules for the $300 billion industry.</br></br>The regulators' review of hedge funds has resulted in at least eight legislative and regulatory recommendations aimed at tightening standards for banks and broker dealers that either lend to or take part in risky investments, many of which are common to hedge-fund portfolios.</br></br>The recommendations are part of a report that will be released as early as today by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes top officials at the Treasury, Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.</br></br>After the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital Management LP last fall, Congress asked the group to find the best way to control hedge funds, which have widely been blamed for aggravating financial crises around the world. Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment pools in which the participants are primarily wealthy individuals.</br></br>Treasury officials outlined the report yesterday during a briefing for House Banking Committee members. Of the three recommendations that would require legislation, the proposal for new disclosures in hedge-fund quarterly filings would have the broadest impact on the industry.
Businesses that have been improperly labeling their employees as independent contractors got a surprise break Wednesday: A new Internal Revenue Service program will allow those businesses to reclassify workers and make only a small payment to cover past payroll taxes.</br></br>The downside for such companies? Regulators say they are going to be more vigilant about misclassification of workers in the future.</br></br>At issue is whether a worker is deemed an employee or an independent contractor. The proper classification depends on factors including how much control or direction an employer wields over workers.</br></br>Employees are entitled to benefits and legal protections, and their wages are subject to payroll taxes. Companies aren't required to withhold income taxes from independent contractors or pay Social Security or Medicare taxes for them. Independent contractors also aren't covered by many labor protections, including minimum-wage and overtime laws, and unemployment or workers' compensation insurance.</br></br>The trouble for businesses, however, is that the distinction between the two categories is vague. The current law is based on a common-law standard involving some 20 factors.

Volcker yesterday warned that progress on the international debt problem is becoming ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½bogged downï¿½Û and that Brazil is "in a grave economic crisis.ï¿½Û</br></br>Volcker, in his annual testimony before the Senate Banking Comm-mittee, also warned that the rapidly growing debt of U.S. corporations and households is making the economy more vulnerable.</br></br>Volckersï¿½Ûªs remarks came as speculation increased in Brazil that the developing worldï¿½Ûªs largest debtor could stop paying the interest on its foreign debt. President Jose Sar- ney will announce today a 90-day suspension on interest payments to some private creditors if Brazil does not get emergency loans, United Press International quoted a presidential palace source as saying yesterday.</br></br>Volcker also testified that the recent increase in the federal funds rate above 6 percent was not a result of a change in Fed monetary policy.</br></br>The federal funds rate is the rate institutions charge each other for overnight loans and it is sensitive to the amount of reserves the Fed supplies to the banking system. Many market analysts look to that rate to try to determine whether the Fed is pursuing a tight or loose See VOLCKER, F3, Col. 3
Foreign investment by businesses will reach its precrisis peak no earlier than 2013, and probably later if there were to be a widespread government-debt crisis, a United Nations agency said on Tuesday.</br></br>The U.N. Conference on Trade and Development said businesses invested $1.24 trillion outside their home countries last year, up 5% from 2009. Based on figures for the first five months of this year, it expects that to rise to between $1.4 trillion and $1.6 trillion this year, $1.7 trillion in 2012 and $1.9 trillion in 2013.</br></br>But Unctad said that rise in foreign direct investment will only happen if a daunting array of pitfalls are sidestepped.</br></br>"Risk factors, such as the unpredictability of global economic governance, a possible widespread sovereign debt crisis, and fiscal and financial sector imbalances in some developed countries, as well as rising inflation and signs of overheating in major emerging market economies, may yet derail the FDI recovery," Unctad said.</br></br>Unctad said that in 2010, the U.S remained the main recipient of foreign direct investment, which rose 49% from 2009, to $228 billion. By contrast, inflows into Europe were down 19% from 2009, with the U.K. suffering a 35% drop to $45.9 billion from $71.1 billion. Overall, flows of investment to developed economies fell slightly, to $602 billion from $603 billion in 2009.
NEW YORK -- To the relief of some bond investors, Fannie Mae's exposure to interest-rate volatility fell significantly last month, suggesting it has made more progress in correcting a big mismatch between its assets and liabilities.</br></br>Fannie Mae, a publicly traded government-sponsored enterprise, said its duration gap -- a measure of how well cash flows from assets and liabilities match up -- narrowed during October to negative six months from negative 10 months for September and negative 14 months for August. Duration measures how sensitive bonds are to moves in interest rates. A negative duration gap suggests cash flow from Fannie Mae's assets will drop more quickly than the stream of payments it owes its debtholders.</br></br>August's figure of negative 14 months was the largest gap ever and prompted concerns among investors about Fannie Mae's ability to meet its obligations. It also sparked a rally in the Treasury market, as investors anticipated Fannie Mae would need to buy a large amount of Treasurys to cover its gap.</br></br>Although Fannie Mae still had a gap for October, the figure fell just within its target range. Spokeswoman Janis Smith declined to say specifically how Fannie Mae narrowed the gap, citing a policy of not commenting on specific market activity. But, she said, "our mortgage commitments, mortgage purchases, hedging with swaps and swaptions [options on swaps], and callable securities are all vehicles we used to manage the duration gap."</br></br>People in the market said Fannie Mae aggressively bought mortgage securities to adjust its portfolio duration. By buying mortgages, Fannie Mae took cash flows of faster prepaying mortgages and reinvested it in newer, lower coupon mortgages. The newer mortgages, which carry lower rates, aren't likely to be refinanced soon, and that helped narrow the duration gap.

Since hitting a low in February, the stock market has roared higher in almost-uninterrupted fashion. The Standard & Poor's 500 has racked up a good year's gain -- nearly 13% -- in just two months' time, and now, near 1200, sits at levels not seen since September 2008. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has turned back its clock to June of that same year -- three months before Lehman Brothers collapsed.</br></br>Yet many small investors are still watching the rally from the sidelines. Through mid-April, investors have put about $6 billion of new money into domestic stock funds so far this year, according to Lipper data. By contrast, they've invested just over $101 billion in taxable and municipal bonds.</br></br>So is now the time to wade back into stocks?</br></br>Perhaps -- if you're looking to put a little money to work in well-run, large companies with strong balance sheets. But many pros say investors who've sat out the rally should continue to husband their cash. With the market up so strongly, and with underlying economic fundamentals still sketchy -- foreclosure just surged again, underemployment remains rife and consumer sentiment has fallen again -- the balance has shifted toward risk and away from return.</br></br>Even the pros seem to be getting twitchy. News Friday that the Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs with fraud tied to subprime mortgages helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a quick 126-point selloff.
Optimism again ruled the stock market, driving two major indexes to records for a second day, even as gloom infected the bond market.</br></br>A report of unexpected manufacturing strength reawakened inflation worries among bond traders, who took back some of Wednesday's gains and pushed the benchmark 30-year bond's yield back above the 6% level.</br></br>But stock investors preferred to focus for a second day on the Federal Reserve's apparent reluctance to raise interest rates further this summer, and they sent stocks ahead for a fifth consecutive day. The Nasdaq Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index set records again. Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 95.62 points, or 0.87%, to 11066.42, just 40.77 points, or 0.37%, short of its May 13 record close of 11107.19.</br></br>"There was some money that was waiting on the sidelines, and had to get into the market once the Fed announcement came out" on Wednesday, said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard A.

U.S. Treasury bonds pulled back after an early price gain, underscoring some uneasiness among traders and investors ahead of the Federal Reserve's next decision on its monetary stimulus for the economy.</br></br>The Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to start a two-day monetary policy meeting Tuesday with an interest-rate statement due at about 2 p.m. EST Wednesday.</br></br>Market participants will zero in on whether the Fed will announce plans to dial back, or "taper," its bond purchases. The central bank's $85 billion-a-month purchases in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities have been a major factor holding Treasury yields near historic lows.</br></br>Traders, investors and analysts believe an improving economy would allow the Fed to start winding down its monetary stimulus. The Fed could act this week or wait until early January to cut bond buying, they said, though they believe the central bank would wind down its monetary stimulus on a gradual basis, which is likely to prevent a sharp rise in bond yields.</br></br>"We do think the odds of a December taper have gone up," said Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc. "That said, the more likely time frame is early 2014, a view supported by the fact that inflation continues to remain low, allowing the Fed more latitude."
With the stock market as spongy as a swamp, and initial public offerings disappearing as if they were swallowed by quicksand, three fearless Washington entrepreneurs are nonetheless starting down the path toward going public.</br></br>While several would-be public companies in the region have pushed the pause button on their IPOs and the most recent one instantly fell below its offering price, three new deals have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</br></br>Nettel Communications Inc. of Washington, which provides communications services to medium-size businesses, hopes to raise $175 million in an offering that was filed last Friday and made public this week.</br></br>MainControl Inc. of McLean hopes to raise about $57 million with an offering that hit the SEC two weeks ago. The company creates software that businesses use to manage their "e-infrastructure," which to non-geeks means their office computers, networks, Internet connections and other information technology equipment.</br></br>Vastera Inc. of Dulles wants to sell $70 million worth of stock. In an April 7 filing, Vastera said it provides international trade management services, using the Internet to help companies make their importing and exporting operations more efficient.
Inflation of the price of goods produced in the United States has ail but disappeared, according to a Labor Department report issued yesterday.</br></br>Prices charged by producers when they first sell a completed item, whether a new car or a bunch of carrots, fell 0.2 percent last month, the department said.</br></br>That decline left the departmentï¿½Ûªs producer price index up a scant 0.2 percent over the past 12 months. Excluding the volatile food and energy goods, the so-called core index was up only 0.1 percent for the year.</br></br>The report was much better than many investors and analysts had expected and set off a strong rally in bond prices, which had slumped badly over the past two weeks.</br></br>As prices rose, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds fell to 6.14 percent from 6.20 percent while rates on securities with shorter maturities fell by lesser amounts.
The outcome of this year's budget battle could hardly have been more disappointing. "Probably 95% of what Clinton wanted, he got," lamented Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Mr. Specter's fellow Republicans then added billions more for themselves. Result: a pork-filled budget of $1.75 trillion, bigger than the entire economy of France.</br></br>But here's some surprising news: The federal government is getting smaller, at least relative to the size of the economy as a whole. This year, for the first time in more than 25 years, federal spending slipped below 20% of gross domestic product. As the chart nearby shows, this percentage has been shrinking throughout the 1990s; it is projected at 19.3% next year. That's still too big, but it's down from 24% just 15 years ago. True, much of this progress is a result of post-Cold War defense cutbacks, but even domestic spending is receding relative to private-sector output.</br></br>This benign fiscal state of affairs seems incomprehensible, given a Congress that has proved itself incapable of cutting nearly any federal agency budgets and a president who has stopped paying even lip service to small government. But America's miracle economy, helped along by Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp's supply-side tax policies, is outgrowing the budget. The federal budget has grown by 132% in 1982, but the GDP has increased by 176%. And Americans' financial wealth has grown to $32 trillion from $7 trillion, four times as fast as federal expenditures. The trend has been quite different for most of the 20th century. Federal spending as a share of GDP rose to 24% in 1982 from 4% in 1932.</br></br>Who gets credit for turning things around? First, Mr. Reagan, who won the Cold War, chopped punitive tax rates roughly in half and made the case that big government was the problem, not the solution. Second, Paul Volcker and his successor, Alan Greenspan, who ended double-digit inflation and returned America to price stability. Third, Bill Gates, Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Steve Case and all the other high-tech entrepreneurs who made possible today's booming information economy.</br></br>All this progress has happened without any serious effort to cut federal spending. If the next president adopts the right small-government policies, he could shrink federal spending to 15% or even 10% of GDP. To get there will require a combination of modest fiscal disciplinary measures to slow federal spending and a prosperity agenda aimed at coaxing economic growth up to 4% or 5% a year. The policy prescriptions necessary include: personalized accounts for Social Security, a flat 20% alternative maximum tax with unlimited IRAs, medical savings accounts for health care, unilateral free trade, the abolition of corporate welfare and an ironclad commitment to keep the Internet tax- and regulation-free.
NEW YORK--Gold prices rose on Friday as a mixed U.S. employment report forced investors to recalibrate their assumptions about the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy.</br></br>Gold for April delivery, the most active contract, gained $5.70, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,262.90 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. This was the highest settlement price since Jan. 27, when futures closed at $1,263.40 an ounce.</br></br>The Labor Department reported Friday that the U.S. economy added 113,000 new jobs in January, well below forecasts of a 189,000 increase. The disappointing data fanned hopes that the Federal Reserve would keep its stimulus program in place for longer than previously thought, sending gold to the day's high of $1,272 an ounce.</br></br>However, gold futures were unable to hold those intraday highs. Some market participants pointed to bright spots in the jobs report such as the upward revisions to November's employment data as well as a month-on-month improvement from December.</br></br>"It is a bad report, but I think you'll need to get another one or two pretty bad ones before the Fed makes a move," said Bob Haberkorn, a senior commodities broker with RJO Futures in Chicago.
Looking at the latest report from Freddie Mac on its accounting problems, I could not suppress a perverse thought: I'd almost feel better about Freddie Mac if the place had been run by the same kind of crooks who caused the Enron and WorldCom scandals.</br></br>You can understand how crooks could screw up a company's books so thoroughly that scores of accountants, after working for six months, still haven't figured up how much money Freddie has been making.</br></br>But Freddie's finances apparently are in chaos not because of nefarious intent, but because some of the smartest people in the mortgage business and some of the best accountants didn't know what they were doing.</br></br>They've given a range of estimates -- $3 billion apart -- of how much income wasn't reported. After taxes, it might have been $1.5 billion more than reported, it might have been $4.5 billion.</br></br>Freddie's finances are such a mess that the accountants are reexamining several hundred thousand transactions, because they don't know what they are.
Activity in the service sector increased at a slightly stronger pace in January than in December, the Institute for Supply Management said. The group reported that its non-manufacturing index rose to 54.5, from the downwardly revised 54.2 in December. Index readings above 50 indicate expansion of activity and prices. The non- manufacturing employment index rose for the first time since February 2001, to 50.3, from 46.9 in December.</br></br>After suspending the sale of dollars for two weeks because of a crippling general strike, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez announced a new fixed currency exchange rate to help bolster the country's flagging foreign reserves. The new policy fixes the currency rate at 1,596 bolivars to the dollar, Chavez said. Chavez said the freeze on foreign currency trading would end with the establishment of the new system. The bolivar closed at a record low of 1,853 on Jan. 21, the last day of currency trading, and trades for 2,500 per dollar on the black market. The decline, in turn, sent inflation past 30 percent, and many economists forecast a 25 percent recession this year.</br></br>Federal safety regulators ordered new inspections of Boeing 747 fuselages as a result of the investigation into the China Airlines crash in the Taiwan Strait in May. The plane broke into four pieces in flight, killing all 225 aboard. The Federal Aviation Administration ordered U.S. operators of 747s to check to see whether a metal repair patch, or doubler, was used to cover scratches or cracks on the underside of the fuselage near the aircraft's tail. Investigators found scratches and a 15-inch crack under a doubler that had been attached to the China Airlines plane after the tail hit a runway in 1980, according to the FAA.</br></br>Delta Air Lines said it will reduce the pay of most executives by 8 percent and the wages of chief executive Leo F. Mullin and President Frederick W. Reid by 10 percent on March 1. Delta also may lower employee pay to keep pace with wage cuts at airlines that have filed for bankruptcy protection, Mullin said.</br></br>Bank of America said it is slashing about 1,000 jobs in technology and operations during the first quarter amid a continued economic slump. The cuts follow the elimination of about 900 jobs in technology and operations in November and December. After the job reductions are complete, the total number of workers in those areas will be 20,000.
One important measure of U.S. inflation rose sharply last month as the surge in world oil prices since mid-January began to work its way through the economy, the Labor Department reported yesterday.</br></br>Producer prices for finished goods rose 1 percent last month, the largest monthly increase since the beginning of last year, principally because of a 5.5 percent jump in energy prices. That included a 21.3 percent increase in the prices refiners charge for gasoline following a 4.5 percent rise in February.</br></br>However, the rising cost of energy -- evident in recent weeks to motorists at the gas pump -- so far does not appear large enough to derail the U.S. economic recovery. It would take a much larger and more sustained oil price shock to seriously damage the economy, partly because it is significantly less dependent on oil than in the past, analysts said.</br></br>Moreover, in the past 10 days, world oil prices have fallen by nearly $4.50 a barrel, erasing more than half of the increase that began earlier this year.</br></br>By one measure, crude oil prices peaked this year at just under $28 a barrel 10 days ago, driven upward largely by rising tensions in the Middle East, the prospect of growing oil demand because of the U.S. economic rebound and the possibility of disruptions in oil shipments from Venezuela because of political turmoil there.
The nation is facing a shortage of cement that could snag the new construction boom and slow down the national economic recovery, according to cement industry spokesmen.</br></br>They say air pollution regulations for new cement plants and federal price controls will cause the shortage to get worse, and they have presented their case to the Commerce Department and filed a suit to stop the Environmental protection Agency (EPA) from enforcing its regulations.</br></br>The shortage has hit Florida hardest because that is where the housing boom is strongest, resulting in construction delays, rationing by manufacturers . and soaring prices for products such as cement block and bag cement.</br></br>But government experts o^ the construction industry say j the cement makersï¿½Ûª lament isj exaggerated, coming more j from a repressed desire to | cash in on the economic up-j turn with big profits than j from a fear of construction in- j dustry catastrophe.	,</br></br>Nationwide, the cement in-! dustry now operates at nearly 95 per cent of its maximum ca* j pacity, according to Commerce | Department estimates. As re-j cently as 1970 the industry! had 20 per cent of its productive capacity idle because of lag in demand after it expanded widely in the early: 1960s in expectation of a boom i that never came.
A few weeks ago, Newsweek ran a cover story that was a model of magazine journalism (the Aug. 30 issue, in case you missed it). Called "A World Without Fathers," it explored in unsparing terms the decline of the two-parent black family. The story was exceptional less for breaking new ground than for forcing all of us, black and white, to think about realities we'd prefer to ignore. A young black child now has only a 1 in 5 chance of growing up with two parents. Nearly two-thirds of black children are now born to single mothers, up from one-fifth in 1960.</br></br>This is, of course, a social disaster. By that, I don't mean that single parenthood inevitably fails. It doesn't. Plenty of children will not only survive, they will thrive, because they have a loving and committed parent. One good parent is better than two lousy parents. But two good parents are better than one. They typically have more money. In 1991 median family income for black married couples was $33,300; for a single mother, median income was $11,400. Parenting is also as trying as it is joyous. Two bodies simply improve the chances of success.</br></br>What's most disastrous about present trends is the explosion of unwed teenage mothers. One-fifth of all black children are now born to unwed teens. These children of children start life with the odds against them. Their parents haven't developed job skills. Many aren't ready for the time-consuming burdens of parenting. Teenagers want to have fun, and although children are fun, raising them is no party. Our schools and social institutions can't compensate for children born before their time.</br></br>We resist talking about these issues. Every discussion risks slipping into a debate about racism, which - for different reasons - makes both blacks and whites seethe. Whites tend to think that blacks resort too easily to racism as an explanation for any difficult problem; blacks tend to think that whites can never understand the barriers they face. All this plays to the worst racial stereotypes on both sides of the color line. But there's also another cause of our mutual reluctance, and it is that no one really knows what to do.</br></br>As the Newsweek story made clear, we don't understand why black families have fared so badly. The causes seem to be a mixture of general societal trends (earlier and easier sex, less stigma to unwed motherhood), economic changes (loss of well-paying factory jobs for black men) and the family patterns of American black culture. Some of these trends also affect whites. Between 1960 and 1990, births to unwed mothers have gone from 2 percent to 21 percent of total white births; and two-thirds of these white mothers are now under 24. They're not Murphy Browns. But the trends have been more devastating for blacks.
The Pay Advisory Committee yesterday recommended a formula that could extend the low-wage exemption to President Carterï¿½Ûªs anti-inflation guideline to at least a third of the nationï¿½Ûªs work force.</br></br>The committee proposed the exemption be extended to any worker in an employe unit with average straight-time hourly eanings below $5.35.</br></br>Committee officials had no estimate of how many workers would be exempt from the wage guideline program, but the proposed standard would exempt at least one third and probably more of the total civilian work force.</br></br>In addition to the new low-wage exemption, the committee, which includes labor, business and public representatives, recommended the present exemption of any individual making less than $4 an hour also be continued.</br></br>As of October, according to Labor Department data, 28.6 percent of more than 60 million employes covered in one survey worked in business establishments whose average hourly pay was less than the $5.35 cutoff.
As 2012 comes to a close, the U.S. economy is also turning a page: The recovery is over. It looks like 2013 will be the start of a more normal, though hardly robust, period of growth.</br></br>For Americans struggling in the still-slow economy, that is both good news and bad. The risk of another recession is diminishing, at least if leaders in Washington can steer clear of the "fiscal cliff." But so are the prospects for a period of rapid growth that brings down the unemployment rate and helps the economy make up the ground lost in the recession.</br></br>Technically, the recovery ended in late 2011 when economic output, adjusted for inflation, returned to its prerecession peak. But on a per-capita basis, gross domestic product still hasn't rebounded to its 2007 high, and by most other measures the economy has remained mired in its postrecession doldrums. For more than three years after the recession ended in June 2009, unemployment remained high, the housing market was depressed, and every economic speed bump brought renewed fears of another recession.</br></br>That is poised to change in 2013. Home prices are finally rising again in much of the country, and construction activity is slowly picking up. Job growth has stabilized at about 150,000 jobs per month, and unemployment, though still elevated, dropped below 8% in September and has continued to fall. If current trends continue, per capita output will surpass its prior peak sometime next year.</br></br>The economy is far from fully healed. The combined net worth of U.S. households remains 12% below its pre-recession peak, after adjusting for inflation.
It isn't the forecast but the weather that tells you when to open the umbrella.</br></br>Janet Yellen opened the Kansas City Federal Reserve annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Friday with the observation that conditions in labor markets have outperformed Fed forecasts--and that if this continues the Fed funds target rate could rise earlier and more rapidly than expected.</br></br>That is a subtle change of emphasis from the Fed chairwoman. Consider a speech she gave at the Economic Club of New York in April. The background message was the same--monetary policy isn't on a preset course and will change based on economic conditions. But the policy implications of this centered around the possibility of a labor "shortfall" necessitating a continuation of ultralow interest rates.</br></br>Now Ms. Yellen is also talking about the possibility of raising rates sooner and at a brisker pace in the case of a "faster convergence" toward the Fed's labor market and inflation goals.</br></br>Additionally, Ms. Yellen noted that the labor market may not have as much slack as stagnant wages might seem to indicate. The inability of some employers to push down wages during the economic slump may have resulted in "pent-up wage deflation" that could hold worker pay down even as the labor market tightens.
Microsoft launched an unusually caustic public broadside yesterday against Google, accusing its archrival of running roughshod over copyrights as it creates an online service for searching books.</br></br>Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Association of Publishers in New York, Thomas C. Rubin, Microsoft's associate general counsel, devoted much of his remarks to an attack on Google's practice of copying entire books into its database, often without the permission of copyright holders.</br></br>"It systematically violates copyright and deprives authors and publishers of an important avenue for monetizing their works," Rubin said, according to prepared remarks. "In doing so, it undermines critical incentives to create."</br></br>Microsoft's salvo came as the software giant faces mounting pressure from Google, which is increasingly extending its reach beyond the Web search that made it the darling of the technology industry.</br></br>Last month, Google began selling an online productivity suite, including e-mail, calendar and Web services, that competes with Microsoft's Office software. Google also continues to extend its substantial lead over Microsoft in Web searching, an area where Microsoft has struggled and that remains the main way users navigate the Internet.
The reaction here to the secretary of state's hard-edged mission to Beijing has been wildly exaggerated. The discussions were tough and the atmosphere frosty, but this was neither a policy debacle nor the "humiliation" press reports have portrayed.</br></br>Christopher laid out in detail what he felt the Chinese had to hear and matched them diplomatic rebuff for rebuff. Progress was made on some points. The U.S. position remained firm. Humiliation, if it were to come, would spring from what happens next.</br></br>Reading the criticisms, one might think that President Clinton invented the linkage between most-favored-nation trade status and China's human rights record. To the contrary, he inherited a legacy of bruising battles between George Bush and Congress that ended each year in a presidential veto.</br></br>After having made things more difficult with campaign rhetoric about coddling dictators, Clinton garnered applause last spring for a policy that deftly threaded the needle between a Congress still angry about Tiananmen Square and recognition of the overriding importance of the U.S.- Chinese relationship.</br></br>The decision separated trade and nonproliferation concerns from the annual MFN review because other legal tools could advance those interests. This narrowed and clarified the contested terrain, responding to China's complaints of constantly moving goal posts. It may also have unintentionally highlighted the most sensitive issue.
PARIS -- In a move that creates a new French defense giant and transforms South Korea's Daewoo Group into a global consumer-electronics leader, the French government decided to sell Thomson SA to France's Lagardere Groupe and its ally, Daewoo.</br></br>The deal marks a milestone for Europe's defense business, which is struggling to consolidate, and came as a surprise to those who had bet that Thomson would go to rival bidder Alcatel-Alsthom SA. The merger of Lagardere's Matra defense division with Thomson's defense arm, Thomson-CSF, will more than double its size in the defense sector and create the second-biggest weapon-systems group in the world, behind Lockheed Martin Corp. of the U.S.</br></br>It also has important ramifications in the U.S., where Thomson's consumer-electronics arm, Thomson Multimedia, is the largest single seller of TV sets, with a 20.5% market share, through the RCA and GE brands it controls. As part of the transaction, Daewoo Electronics will buy Thomson Multimedia from Lagardere for an undisclosed price. Thomson Multimedia has bled red ink, and its sale could jeopardize some of its 6,000 jobs in the U.S., although Daewoo said it has no immediate plans to reorganize the operations.</br></br>Daewoo said it will rely on existing management in Paris and outside Indianapolis, where the U.S. operations are based. However, Daewoo Electronics Chairman Bae Soon Hoon said he believes Daewoo's cost-cutting know-how will reverse recent losses at Thomson Multimedia. North America represents 64% of Thomson Multimedia's sales.</br></br>Though the sale of Thomson had set off a furious behind-the-scenes lobbying effort by both Lagardere and Alcatel, the company is by no means a prize. In fact, the government is selling Thomson for a symbolic sum of one French franc and will inject 11 billion francs ($2.1 billion) into the group before its sale to partially wipe out debts of 25 billion francs. Indeed, Thomson is in such dismal shape that shares of Alcatel, France's telecommunications giant, rose 2.4% in Paris stock-market trading on the news that its bid failed. Trading in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF was suspended yesterday.
BRUSSELS--European markets enjoyed letting the U.S. debt-ceiling circus steal the spotlight. It didn't last long.</br></br>Markets across the Continent slumped Monday, a reminder that the euro zone's own debt woes remain far from resolved. Stocks in Italy, the currency union's second-most indebted country after Greece, were particularly hit hard. The Milan bourse slumped 3.9%, and bank shares were among the biggest losers. Banco Popolare SC and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA both closed down almost 8%.</br></br>Italy's government bonds also weakened; the yield on the 10-year bond rose 0.12 percentage point, to 5.987%, compared with 2.469% for 10-year German bunds.</br></br>European trading began Monday on a relatively optimistic note after news that a debt-ceiling deal was at hand in the U.S. But investors soured over the course of the day, and stocks accelerated their fall near the end of trading when the Institute for Supply Management released weak manufacturing figures in the U.S. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 lost 0.7%, the German DAX dropped 2.9% and France's CAC-40 shed 2.3%.</br></br>Besides Italy, Spain--another worrying spot in the euro zone--also had a rough day; the Madrid stock market closed down 3.2%. Some of the nervousness in Europe relates to fears about the health of the U.S. economy, but significant concern remains that policy makers' recent efforts to bolster Greece and implement measures to backstop the rest of the euro zone aren't convincing.
Weak economic news drove bond prices higher and knocked the major stock indexes lower. The dollar gained against most major currencies.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.40 to 3355.41 in heavy trading. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 1.37 to 442.01 and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 1.26 to 669.51.</br></br>Bond investors were encouraged by yesterday's downbeat economic news. The National Association of Purchasing Management said its index declined to 55.8% in February from 58% in January. It was the first time since September that the index, which measures activity in the manufacturing sector, hasn't increased from the previous month.</br></br>In addition, the National Association of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes slid 6.4% in January from December, and the Commerce Department reported that construction spending fell 1.3% in January from December.</br></br>Analysts said bond prices continue to rally in the belief that the bond market will benefit regardless of the outcome of President Clinton's economic proposals. If Mr. Clinton succeeds in cutting the deficit, government financing demands will decline, making current long-term Treasury bonds more valuable. And if the new taxes that are part of his economic plan slow the economy, as some analysts expect, inflation will remain benign.
The basis for an optimistic outlook on business in 1956 is the powerful procedures developed to keep the economy from spiraling inflation or deflation. This reason was expressed yesterday by Arthur R. Upgren, dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, Dartmouth College in addressing the eighth regional conference of the American Savings & Loan Institute at the Sheraton-Park Hotel.</br></br>Dr. Upgren referred to the record of housing expenditures to emphasize the strength of the economy. He recalled that President Eisenhower said about a year ago that the gross ^national prodiction in 1956 might reach $500 billion, an estimate of the Joint Committee on the Economic Report. The output for 1965 was calculated at $535 billion.</br></br>When the estimates werei made housing expenditures! were at the annual rate of $11.8. billion. The housing estimate j ifor 1956 was $16 billion. In the) second quarter of 1955, total j housing expenditures were at [the annual rate of $16.3 billion,1 so that the actual rate of outlay in one year surpassed an [estimate made for 11 years ahead.</br></br>William J. Hallahan, member of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board cited the course which legislation affecting savings and loan association takes. It is not only studied by both the United States Savings & Loan League and the National Savings & Loan League, but also by other financial interests. In short, it is considered from every point of view, be said.</br></br>Ray Owen, first vice president, American Savings & Loan Institute referred to the rapid; [growth of the population and' stressed the need for training' personnel lo administer the pol-j icies of savings and loan institutions.
NEW YORK -- Stock and bond prices plunged after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated the central bank probably won't lower interest rates further anytime soon. The dollar was mixed.</br></br>Long-term Treasury bond prices fell about $11.25 for each $1,000 face amount, pushing some long-term interest rates above 7.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 47.18 to 3224.96 in heavy trading. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 4.62 to 410.34, and the Nasdaq Composite Index fell 4.98 to 616.31.</br></br>Both the stock and bond markets opened on a stable footing after President Bush's State of the Union address Tuesday night, in which he laid out a package of proposals aimed at stimulating economic growth. But later, Mr. Greenspan told a congressional committee that he thinks interest rates are already low enough to spark an economic recovery and that the Fed probably won't hurry to push them lower.</br></br>That upset bond investors, who had been counting on another reduction by the Fed. And as long-term interest rates headed higher, nervous stock investors grew fearful that the higher rates could choke off an economic recovery even before it begins.</br></br>The sharp retreat came on the heels of the Dow industrials' rise to a record Tuesday. If investors become convinced that the Fed isn't going to help the economy, a full-blown correction could materialize, some analysts suggested.
The worries that drove the stock market to steep losses last week persisted, sending financial stocks sharply lower, though gains by a few large blue-chip companies contributed to a mixed finish for major indexes.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 70.51 points to 12280.32, a modest comeback from the previous session's nearly 395-point drop. Among its components, Alcoa was the biggest riser, up 7.5% on speculation that it might be a takeover target. McDonald's rose 4.1% after reporting strong sales for May.</br></br>Developments at big financial firms overshadowed any good news. Lehman Brothers slid 8.7% after it projected a second-quarter net loss of about $2.8 billion and announced plans to raise $6 billion in new capital. The capital raising was anticipated, but the amount was above most expectations.</br></br>It was a reminder that credit concerns continue to stalk Wall Street giants and a deteriorating economic environment could compound pressures facing the nation's leading financial institutions. Dow component J.P. Morgan Chase fell 6.4%.</br></br>"There's probably another shoe to drop," said Dave Rovelli, head trader at Canaccord Adams. "It's impossible to quantify because nobody knows what these financials have in their books -- even these financials don't understand what they have."
NEW YORK, May 16 Ml.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½'The stock market maintained an attitude of cautious defense this week as it advanced.</br></br>This is the third straight week that the market has gone up. During that time all of the biggest daily moves were up.</br></br>Right now the slock market is around the top of the narrow range in which it has swung for six weeks after tumbling down in the break that followed Red proposals for an exchange of Korean prisoners.</br></br>During this period there has been a lot of money either switched from one stock to another or idle money Stalling in the Korean truce talks reinvested in the market with an eye to further recover. Many characterized their action as defensive, was a signal for caution. And many would like to sit on the sidelines until after President Eisenhower talks next week on national security.</br></br>The extent of caution was underlined by the fact that the daily average volume of 1,126,000 shares was the lowest in nearly seven months.
. scrap President Carterï¿½Ûªs biggest NATO initiative:; getting alliance members to commit themselves to increase defense spending by . at least 3 percent a year after allowing for inflation.</br></br>In an apparent policy shift expected to delight 'NATO partners, particularly West Germany and Britain who contend an inflexible 3 percent increase is too demanding, Defense Secretary-designate Caspar W- Weinberger said he does not believe in holding allies to such a rigid standard.</br></br>While stressing NATO and other friendly countries must join the United States in doing more to shore up their own defenses and keep world sea-lanes open, Weinberger kicked President Carterï¿½Ûªs 3 percent standard toward the ash can with these: words at his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday: "I donï¿½Ûªt know that it is particularly useful to de-i , mand or talk about specified or fixed percentagesï¿½Û of increases in friendly countriesï¿½Ûª defense budgets.. Instead, he indicated the Reagan administration will settle for a generalized commitment.</br></br>"It is in everyoneï¿½Ûªs interest in NATO and Japan' and elsewhere to join in this effortï¿½Û by the United States to right the adverse military balance between the West and the Soviet bloc, Weinberger said.</br></br>1 "Itï¿½Ûªs a mutual enterprise in which everybody has . exactly the same interest,ï¿½Û he added. "I donï¿½Ûªt think itï¿½Ûªs an effective measure simply to look at how, imuch or what percentage. I would like to see the; end result. I donï¿½Ûªt believe in these fixed percentages.; I think sometimes they may be too low and some-; ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½times they may be high enough to involve some waste. What I would like to look at is the end prod-i ;uct; are we getting the strength we need? Thereï¿½Ûªs no1 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½doubt that requires increased percentages, but by; the same token I think we will get a far more effec-i tive result if we look at what we are getting for it.ï¿½Û '
NEW YORK, April 24 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock market prices slipped lower today under the weight of consolidation pressures and several unfavorable news developments.</br></br>The closing Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 6.32 to 957.48. Earlier it had been down more than 7 points.</br></br>There were 455 advances and 1,000 declines out of 1,761 issues traded on the Big Board. The market had 34 new yearly highs and 76 new lows.</br></br>American Stock Exchange prices also dipped, with Hie Amex price-change index off .10 at 28.20. Volume was 3.88	million shares compared with 5.18 million shares Friday. There were 326 advances and 615 declines out of 1,206 issues traded.</br></br>Over-the-counter trading resulted in a drop of 1.11 to 131.90 in the NASDAQ composite index. The industrial indicator was off 1.00 to 140.44. All other categories were on the negative side.
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION is a subject with larger philosophic dimensions than, at first glance, you might suspect. What, would you say, are the communityï¿½Ûªs responsibilities to people who have contributed to their own unemploymentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the people who were fired for misbehavior or who voluntarily quit? The states have wide latitude in setting their rules, and the District of Columbia is a good deal more generous than either of its neighboring states.</br></br>The question came up last fall, when it developed that two candidates for the city school board were being supported by unemployment insurance while they campaignedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and two incumbent members had been drawing it earlier while they served. The same question comes up again now, because the city is about to raise the payroll tax that pays for this insurance. A number of employers, and the Metropolitan Washington Board of Trade, have been arguing that the city ought to tighten the eligibility requirements.</br></br>Who pays for unemployment insurance? Legally, it's the employers. They are assessed a flat percentage of their payrolls. But an economist would say that most of it is actually paid, indirectly and unconsciously. by the employeesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½since, after all. employers generally look on payroll taxes as wages. Most businesses pass wage costs on to their customers, .which means that an increase in payroll taxes also contributes to inflation and hits consumers. The burden is widely spread throughout the community.</br></br>The number of people drawing benefits at the end of last month was 3.3 percent of the labor force currently covered by unemployment insurance. The rate in Virginia was 2.0 percent; in Maryland, 4.1 percent; and nationwide 4.4 percent. By national standards, the system and its taxes are not particularly onerous around here.</br></br>The rise in the rates in recent years is due mainly to the recession, not to any epidemic of lax administration. But to say that doesnï¿½Ûªt quite answer the troubling issue of people who walked out of their jobs.
The New York Stock Exchange struck an agreement with the city and state of New York to build its first major new facility in a century while staying in its historic lower-Manhattan neighborhood.</br></br>The city and state are putting up a record $560 million in subsidies, tax breaks and other benefits to build a 60-story office tower, including a state-of-the-art trading facility, across from the Big Board's current home at Broad and Wall streets.</br></br>The long-expected agreement is critical to both city and exchange. The stock exchange gets vital space to add more foreign stocks and trading technology, while the city and state retain the institution that defines the New York City financial district, which has only recently recovered from the early 1990s real-estate recession.</br></br>But the deal also carries risks for both sides. The Big Board, by far the world's biggest stock market, is prospering now, but its "open outcry" system of trading stocks on a physical floor faces serious challenges from electronic-trading systems. Such systems have prompted many foreign markets to scrap their floors entirely. And though it is the financial district's first new office tower in 10 years, signs of a slowing economy have made speculative new construction risky, and some projects are already being called off around the country.</br></br>The agreement, announced jointly yesterday by the state, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Big Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Richard Grasso, is subject to a more definitive agreement and to approval by the exchange's board. Under the deal, the city and state will acquire a site across Broad Street now primarily occupied by J.P. Morgan & Co. and find a developer to build the tower.
NEW YORK, Aug 10 (AP) ~ After hovering around its 19-monlh low tor most of Lite clay, the stock market rallied just before today's close to post a strong advance.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of ,10 industrial stocks rose 7.(12 points to 887.04. It dosed unchanged Tuesday from Monday's 10-month low of 870.42.</br></br>The lower volume symbolized investor hesitancy early in the day amid indications that the federal money-supply figures to be released Thursday would show another sharp increase.</br></br>Analysts also attributed ï¿½Û¢ the upswing,to expectations' that July wholesale pride index data to be released Thursday would be favorable.</br></br>71%. Another favorite, Xerox, which gained % Tuesday after bettor-than-expcctcd profits for the latest quarter, advanced an-olhcr 1% today to 53%.
A fresh wave of selling swamped overseas financial markets yesterday, as investors worried that the Asian economic crisis is worsening anew and that Russia is nearing the brink of default on its foreign debts.</br></br>The plunge in stock prices hit financial centers from Hong Kong to Frankfurt to Johannesburg, evoking memories of the globe-girdling flight of capital that devastated markets last fall. Yesterday's sell-off initially hit U.S. stocks, too, with the Dow Jones industrial average down as much as 175 points at midday before rebounding to close down just 27 points.</br></br>Among the hard-hit markets yesterday were Hong Kong, where the main stock index fell 5.3 percent; Indonesia, where stocks tumbled 3.9 percent; and Frankfurt, where share prices skidded about 3 percent. In Eastern Europe, which is closely tied economically to Russia, Polish share prices fell 3 percent to a four-month low and Hungarian stock prices dropped 3.4 percent to the lowest level since December.</br></br>In early trading today in Asia, market indexes were mixed. South Korea's key stock index rose 4.2 percent, Japan's gained 1.4 percent and Hong Kong's was up fractionally. Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia markets were lower.</br></br>The darkest storm cloud hangs over Russia, whose main stock index plummeted another 10.5 percent yesterday, bringing its losses this month to 40 percent. In response, the Russian government tripled short-term interest rates yesterday to 150 percent in a desperate attempt to make investments in the country more attractive and keep the ruble stable. {Details, Page A30.}
NEW YORK -- You've heard of triplewitching days in the stock market, during which stocks move wildly for no fundamental reason?</br></br>Now, we've got the Russell Rampage.</br></br>In one of the stock market's modern-day quirks, scores of small stocks (such as General Magic) have been momentarily rising in the past two weeks, while others (Crown Books) have been inexplicably falling. Such gyrations are almost certain to continue this week and to reach a climax on Friday.</br></br>Why? It's the annual "reconstitution" of the Russell 2000 index of small stocks, a once-harmless phenomenon that is becoming increasingly tricky for investors in the small-stock arena.</br></br>Some $13.9 billion is run by fund managers who merely try to match the Russell 2000 -- and who thus have no choice but to jump in or out of stocks being added or delisted. What's more, other fund managers who aim to beat the Russell benchmark base many of their decisions on what is in the index. What it all means is that small stocks, which can be swayed by just a few investors, are getting hit by relative herds of buyers or sellers.
NEW YORK, Dec. 6 (AP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The stock market today reacted to the credit tightening move by the Federal Reserve Board with shock and surprise that battered prices in a huge wave of early selling, but the list came back to cut its losses greatly.</br></br>Had the first-hour loss remained uncut, it would have been the steepest for any day since Nov. 22, 1963, the day President Kennedy was assassinated, but the final loss, though sharp, will never make history.</br></br>Emotional selling reached such a pitch, however, that volume was swelled to the fourth largest in history, 11.48 million shares.</br></br>clined 6.57 at 939.53, coming back from its worst slide of 17.60 at the end of the first hour when volume reached 3.94 million shares, the largest for the initial 60 minutes since the New York Stock Exchange began recording hourly volume figures in 1933.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks fell 2.6 to 350.7 with industrials off 3.1, rails off 2.0 and utilities off 1.4.
Small-cap consumer stocks climbed Thursday on some better-than- expected May sales reports, offsetting renewed concerns surrounding a return of rising oil prices.</br></br>Also helping stocks was a surprising drop in the number of jobless claims last week, as the number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell to a six-week low, signaling some improvement in labor-market conditions ahead of Friday's employment report for May. As a result, key small-cap indexes closed at highs for 2008.</br></br>Leading the way for consumer stocks was teen retailer Buckle, which continues to report outsize increases. The company posted a 35% increase in May same-store sales; in the first four months of the year, the lowest growth was January's 19%. Buckle ended the day up $1.72, or 3.7%, at $48.57 on the New York Stock Exchange. Among other small-cap retailers posting better-than-expected May same-store sales, Cache rose 1.89, or 15%, to 14.59, while Hot Topic increased 89 cents, or 17%, to 6.16.</br></br>The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks climbed 19.56 points, or 2.63%, to 763.27, and the Standard & Poor's SmallCap 600 rose 9.34 points, or 2.38%, to 402.07, marking their biggest one-day gains since April 16. Both closed at their highest points this year.</br></br>The biggest one-day dollar increase in crude oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange did little to stop the momentum of consumer stocks, while driving several energy names higher. Within that sector, Swift Energy (NYSE) gained 3.66, or 6.4%, to 60.80.
A top official at the Japanese Finance Ministry met yesterday with officials from the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, fueling speculation in global markets that Tokyo is seeking a multinational effort to brake a surge in the U.S. dollar that is threatening prospects for recovery in Asia's battered economies.</br></br>In international currency markets yesterday, the dollar fell 3 yen from an earlier 5 1/2-year high of 134.25 yen per dollar as traders braced for the possibility that officials in the U.S. and Europe might join Japan in a coordinated effort to stem the dollar's rise by selling greenbacks.</br></br>The yen stabilized in trading today in Tokyo, changing hands by late afternoon at 132.30 yen to the dollar, but there was no signal from Treasury that U.S. officials were contemplating market action. Many analysts and investors concluded that U.S. officials were insisting on bolder economic reforms from the Japanese government aimed at boosting growth in Japan, as the price of U.S. help in halting the dollar's climb.</br></br>"I have got to believe that the U.S. is saying, `Yes, we can help, but that's only possible if you make some basic changes in your policies. Otherwise, we'd just be whistling in the wind,' " said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, who said Japanese officials have good reason to "fear the prospect of their currency in free fall," much like those afflicting other Asian currencies.</br></br>A standoff between the United States and Japan would be likely to exacerbate Asia's financial crisis, which took yet another turn for the worse yesterday as stock markets and currencies across the region declined sharply, led by a 6 percent plunge in Hong Kong's Hang Seng index that was followed by another 5 percent fall in early trading today (Story, Page C2).
NEW YORK. March 9 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock market volume zoomed above six million shares today as prices milled turbulcntly.</br></br>Once again, turnover was the biggest in about 51 a years, harking back to the 7.72-million-share day of Sept. 26, 1955 when prices reeled under the news of President Eisenhowerï¿½Ûªs heart attack.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fall 2.82 to 663.33. Standard & Poorï¿½Ûªs 500-stock index rose .06 to 63.50.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks dipped .20 to 238.10 with industrials down .60, rails up .30 and utilities unchanged.</br></br>Profit taking mingled with reinvestment and switching against a background of continued eager public participation in the market. Once again, many of the volume leaders were lower-priced issues.
President Clinton will renew most-favored-nation trade privileges for China despite frictions over human rights and other problems, said Anthony Lake, his national security adviser. The president has until June 3 to announce whether he will renew China's trade privileges. Lake said he did not expect a major fight from the Republican-led Congress on renewal of the privileges, which allow China to export its goods to the United States under the lowest possible tariffs.</br></br>UUNet Technologies' stock shot up $12 in its first day of trading on the Nasdaq stock market to close at $26. The Fairfax company's 4.725 million shares were initially priced at $14 each. UUNet is one of the country's biggest providers of access to the Internet. Stocks of two other newly public technology companies -- computer software company Maxis, and chipmaker Nexgen, also soared on their first day on the market.</br></br>Irwin "Sonny" Bloch, a longtime financial radio talk show host, was accused by federal regulators of selling unregistered securities and misleading his listeners about their value, thus defrauding investors of nearly $21 million. Bloch, 58, whose programs are heard on 170 stations, was named in a 35-count criminal case in Newark and a civil case filed by the SEC in Manhattan federal court. His lawyer, Paul Goldberger, said Bloch moved to the Dominican Republic before charges were brought, and was "not guilty."</br></br>Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell at auction to the lowest level in more than eight months. The average discount rate was 5.54 percent, down from 5.90 percent at the last auction on April 27. The bills will carry an equivalent coupon interest rate of 5.88 percent, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,439.80.</br></br>Office Depot of Delray Beach, Fla., the largest office supply retailer in North America, said Mark Begelman resigned as president and chief operating officer, although he will continue as a director. Chairman and CEO David Fuente will assume the additional position of president for the immediate future.
The price rise of theglobe.com's stock on its first day of trading last Nov. 13 was the most spectacular ever for an initial public offering. But the trading session also was one of the messiest ever on the Nasdaq Stock Market.</br></br>Theglobe.com was priced the night before at $9 a share. The next morning, there was a crush of demand. At the opening, some investors bought it for $96 to $97 a share from Mayer & Schweitzer Inc., a unit of Charles Schwab Corp. At the same time, underwriter Bear Stearns Cos. was selling shares for $90, and someone sold it on Instinet Corp.'s screen-based trading system for $87. The apparent result: Some buyers overpaid or some sellers sold too low.</br></br>The controversial opening illustrates the structural problems plaguing Nasdaq. Though it once boasted of being "the stock market for the next hundred years," Nasdaq's inability so far to resolve these issues could make it vulnerable to competition from upstart electronic exchanges and, perhaps soon, from the New York Stock Exchange, too.</br></br>By all accounts, the 1997 reforms that followed an investigation into dealers' alleged fixing of stock prices made Nasdaq a fairer market. But those reforms, coupled with advances in electronic trading, are fragmenting Nasdaq into many submarkets, making it harder to ensure that buyers and sellers are getting the best price. "It's an absolute Frankenstein," Douglas Atkin, chief executive officer of Instinet, said at a conference in March.</br></br>The National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent, thought it had a solution last year to this problem: a "central limit order book" into which investors and dealers from around the country could funnel orders. Big brokerage firms and institutional investors backed it as an essential step. But some firms saw it as proof that NASD management was bent on competing with its own members. Seeing a threat to their livelihoods, those members fought and killed the proposal.
Housing starts surged by 4.4 percent last month, offering evidence that consumer confidence is taking hold and triggering a new bout of inflation fears on Wall Street.</br></br>Stock and bond prices tumbled on yesterdayï¿½Ûªs Commerce Department report, which surpassed many economistsï¿½Ûª expectations, as investors concluded the economy is overheating. The yield on the benchmark 30Vi-year Treasury bond, which goes up when prices go down, hit 7.996 percent, its highest level in more than two years.</br></br>Analysts said the Federal Reserve is all ,but certain to raise short-term interest rates again next month in an effort to slow the economy's growth.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There must have been a lot of raised eyebrows at the Fed this morning," said David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, who predicted the central bank's top policy makers would raise short-term interest rates by at least a halfpercentage point when they next meet on Nov. 15.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The housing sector is the most interest-sensitive sector of the economy, but so far it See HOUSING, BS.CoL 4 hasnï¿½Ûªt been affected by higher rates," he said. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think this will force the Fed to regroup and raise rates again.ï¿½Û
Major Latin American markets, under pressure earlier this week from rumors about Argentina's currency, rebounded. But the mood remains cautious following the U.S. Federal Reserve's shift to a bias in favor of tightening interest rates.</br></br>The currency rumors, immediately denied by the Argentine government, were further dispelled late Wednesday when a former economy minister denied having said Argentina should float the peso anytime soon. Domingo Cavallo's calming words helped lift Argentina's Merval Index 1.2%, partially offsetting a 4.3% decline during Wednesday's session. Mexico's IPC Index bounced back 1.2%.</br></br>But another interest-rate cut in Brazilits fourth in three weeks-failed to inject much life into the Bovespa, which was flat for most of yesterday's session. That suggests to some investors this highflying market could have reached an inflection point, where anticipated interest-rate cuts will no longer automatically power the Bovespa higher.</br></br>"This the first time I can remember that the Brazil market failed to go up after good news," said Stephen Oler, senior portfolio manager for Latin America at Putnam Investments in Boston. "It means that the market may need to consolidate before resuming its advance."</br></br>In other markets, Asian stocks enjoyed a slight rebound of their own, though South Korea's Kospi Index continued to slide. European stocks, led by the telecommunications sector, propped up most major markets.
The House and Senate Bank-iijg Committees yesterday voted to give President Ford the anti - inflation monitoring agency he requested Monday night.</br></br>Members of both committees agreed that they were not giving the President any authority he did not already have, since hp could establish such a task force by executive order, But the consensus on botli committees was that it could not do any harm and since it was Mr. Fordï¿½Ûªs first request as President he should have it.</br></br>Both Mouse and Senate arc] expected to vote Monday on their respective versions of the monitoring agency bill. Although the thrust of both proposals is the same, there are enough diferences to require a conference to shape a bill acceptable to both chambers.</br></br>Both versions of the bill authorize Mr. Ford to set up a White House council to monitor wage and price developments and collect data on various sectors of the economy, in order to pinpoint both private and government sources of inflation.</br></br>The proposed agency will, in effect, take the place of the larger and more powerful Cost of Living Council, which went out of existence .June 30. This agency would not have the power to impose mandatory wage and price controls, which the old Cost of Living Council had until April 30.
FINANCIAL PLANNER Joseph Lyons recently moved client assets out of a Putnam Investments mutual fund whose manager allegedly made improper trades in its shares. Mr. Lyons didn't move it out of the stock market. He chose another stock mutual fund, managed by Morgan Stanley.</br></br>Like many others, he wants to avoid funds tainted by the sprawling mutual-fund trading scandal that erupted in early September, but he isn't giving up on stocks. It's hard to resist a market that seemingly keeps going up. Enthusiasm for stocks pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average through the 10000 mark yesterday, the highest level in 18 months.</br></br>After a family discussion of the issues, 43-year-old Mr. Lyons, who works with investment firm Linsco Private Ledger, in Walnut Creek, Calif., shifted his wife's retirement holdings from several Putnam Investment funds to some Fidelity Investments portfolios. He's out to protect his clients' -- and his family's -- interests.</br></br>"As long as the stock market is doing well, people will keep investing," says Steve Henningsen, a financial adviser with the Wealth Conservancy in Boulder, Colo. "It's kind of weird this scandal hasn't chased people from funds."</br></br>Although many irate individuals and institutions have unloaded holdings of funds run by Putnam Investments, which has settled federal charges in the matter, and Strong Capital Management, which is under investigation but hasn't been charged with any wrongdoing, and other firms implicated in the scandal, money flowing into the fund industry as a whole has been surprisingly robust. From the start of September through the end of last month, stock mutual funds took in more than $63 billion, their highest three-month intake since early 2000 when stock prices peaked, according to flow-tracker AMG Data Services. This money has helped fuel the stock market's rise.
NEW YORK, July 14ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Big-name computer stocks drove the Nasdaq market to a record close for the eighth straight session today, but broader stock market indexes ended nearly unchanged after an early foray toward new highs.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.16 points to close at 7922.98 after erasing a 61-point deficit in the last half-hour of trading. The Dow turned lower in the afternoon alter surrendering a 29-point gain that put the blue-chip barometer within 50 of the 8000 mark.</br></br>The technology-oriented Nasdaq composite index rose 21.26 points, to 1523.88, giving it an eight-session gain of 85 points, or nearly 6 percent</br></br>Microsoft which reports on its second-quarter profits on Thursday, jumped 6-3/16 to 135-15/16, and Dell Computer rose 47/e to 14254 on top of Friday's 9-point surge to lead Mondayï¿½Ûªs Nasdaq advance.</br></br>On the New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, Hewlett-Packard rose 4-1/16, to 65-1/16, as the Dowï¿½Ûªs biggest gainer, and Compaq Computer rose 4%, to 12814.
[Financial Analysis and Commentary]</br></br>Faced with a slowing economy, stubbornly high unemployment, volatile markets and a split on the monetary-policy committee, Ben Bernanke still has time for humor.</br></br>Asked after his speech to the Economic Club of Minnesota about disagreements over what the Federal Reserve should do next, Chairman Bernanke joked: "When two people always agree, one is redundant."</br></br>And, while markets fell on disappointment that he offered no new commitments to easing, Mr. Bernanke took full advantage of the final soft-ball question from Steve Sanger, former CEO of General Mills. It avoided addressing the economy and the Fed's response at all. Instead, Mr Bernanke was asked what he thought of actor Paul Giamatti's portrayal of him in the HBO movie "Too Big to Fail." He said he had never seen it: "I saw the original."</br></br>---
NEW YORK--After a relentless two-day rally, the bull run in Treasurys hit the skids Friday with benchmark yields rising from the lowest level since the 1940s.</br></br>But the selloff only put a dent in the sharp run-up in bond prices this week. The 30-year bond was the biggest winner and its yield, which moves inversely to its bond price, tumbled about 0.47 percentage point for the week. That was the biggest weekly decline since December 2008 when Treasury prices soared on the financial crisis.</br></br>The benchmark 10-year note was 27/32 lower to yield 1.810%. The 30-year bond was 1 28/32 lower to yield 2.872%. The two-year note was 1/32 lower to yield 0.214%.</br></br>Some traders were quick to claim that it was a sign that a correction is due for the ferocious strength over the past seven months. The benchmark 10-year yield has tumbled from this year's peak of 3.77% in February and earlier Friday touched a fresh historic low of 1.672%.</br></br>Demand for safe-haven Treasurys had intensified this month due to rising fears about the global economy and the euro-zone's debt crisis. The Federal Reserve's announcement earlier this week to sell $400 billion short-dated bonds to buy longer-dated Treasurys triggered more flight into the 10-year and 30-year Treasurys. Investors are heartened that the Fed's buying binge in coming months could help boost the value of the bonds.
Strong income gains and unseasonably warm weather prompted consumers to spend more money than usual in January. Along with data showing manufacturing activity expanded in February, that suggests the economy is on track for robust first-quarter growth.</br></br>Personal income of Americans increased 0.7% in January, the biggest jump since September, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.</br></br>The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.</br></br>Consumer spending is "strengthening sharply in the first quarter" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is "recovering after the post-hurricane lull" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.</br></br>The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements. Excluding these special factors, personal income increased 0.4% in January, BEA says.
Republican challenger Patrick J. Buchanan brought his angry, insurgent message today to a hard-hit region of New Hampshire that is responding to his invitation to "send a message" to President Bush.</br></br>In this community, which in 1988 had one of the lowest levels of unemployment in the nation but now has one of the highest in this recession-scarred state, many of the small businessmen attending a Chamber of Commerce gathering said they are strongly inclined, if not committed, to back the tough-talking Buchanan, and to abandon past loyalty to Bush.</br></br>"You have to have someone tough enough to stand up to the Democrats in Congress," said 35-year-old accountant Roger Marceau. Marceau was one of eight chamber members interviewed after Buchanan spoke, each one of them virtually certain they will support the columnist.</br></br>In contrast to working-class voters who are drawn under economic pressure to the Democratic Party, the small businessmen and women here were unanimous in their view that government spending is eating up private sector resources, and taxes - particularly the 1986 tax bill ending the deduction for consumer interest - have severely undermined the economy.</br></br>"I won't quit and I won't compromise," Buchanan said. "I will fight. There is no way you can defeat a Democratic Congress . . . if you will not fight for conservative and Republican principles. {I will tell Congress} `You don't think I have the authority to cut this pork barrel out, take me to the Supreme Court.' "
Hood College, beset by financial woes that threatened its survival, has won permission to use $10.5 million of its endowment funds to pay off its most serious debts in a move that some experts called unique.</br></br>The private college in Frederick, which admitted men to its residential program for the first time this year, had defaulted on loans to two banks and was on the verge of having to consider closing when it took the unusual step of seeking a judge's approval to tap into its $50 million endowment, according to court records.</br></br>The bulk of Hood's endowment is made up of funds earmarked by donors for special purposes -- such as scholarships or new buildings -- that generally cannot be touched for regular operating expenses. But Hood officials argued in their petition to Frederick County Circuit Court that the institution would have to shut down if not allowed access to the restricted funds. Hood's actions were first reported in the Baltimore Business Journal.</br></br>Like many small, private liberal arts colleges, Hood has been buffeted in recent years by a flagging economy and the sharp decline in enrollment experienced by many other women's colleges. That trend prompted Hood's decision last year to go fully coeducational starting with the current academic year.</br></br>President Ronald J. Volpe said last week that the unconventional endowment disbursal is one of several moves he believes have set the institution on the path to fiscal rejuvenation. Hood recently laid off about 30 non-teaching employees to reduce expenses. Meanwhile, enrollment has risen in the past two years from 1,500 to 1,700 full- and part-time students, and Hood last week sold part of a large off- campus property in a deal that will provide a $3 million cushion for the coming academic year.
Bucking dire predictions about the effects of impeachment, declining earnings and sky-high price-to-earnings ratios, the stock market has risen for the past six sessions in a row and could return more than 30 percent in 1999. In fact, the four years that come to a close this Thursday may be the best in history.</br></br>Throughout this bull market, naysayers have fretted about lofty valuations, but stocks have simply climbed higher. Today, for example, the P/E ratio of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, the best proxy for the broad market, is an astronomical 32, compared with an average of 19 over the past 12 years.</br></br>Could it be that prominent pessimists -- such as Robert Shiller of Yale and John Campbell of Harvard, who said two years ago (with the Dow at 6382) that stocks were at unsustainable heights, and the Economist magazine, which seems almost to be cheering for a crash -- are drawing conclusions from an antiquated model of the market? It seems so.</br></br>With a colleague, economist Kevin Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute, I have been working for the past year on a book that offers an explanation for the fabulous returns of recent years. We argue that stocks are moving now to correct a state of perennial undervaluation and that this strong upward trend will continue.</br></br>Our analysis is pretty technical, but it begins with a fact that economists have known for years: Over the long term, stocks are no more risky than bonds. Stocks and bonds should logically provide roughly the same returns, but stocks return far more -- an average of 11 percent a year, compared with just 5 percent for bonds.
Ask a Republican or any of a broad range of grieving Democrats what the big issue against Jimmy Carter is going to be, and he will answer ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½foreign policy.ï¿½Û This is hardly surprising, since whether or not you blame this administration, there is no denying that American policy abroad-has been sustaining an uncommon share of disasters and disappointments on Carterï¿½Ûªs watch. What ivill be surprising is if the national political argument over these things materializes in a tough-minded, energetic and interesting way, or if it even materializes at all. Foreign-policy opposition is one of the things we do worst in this countryï¿½ï¿½ï¿½fitfully, unhappily, nervously, noisily, inconclusively and, given all that, fortunately not very often.</br></br>It is no accident that when an American wishes to praise (or assume) the role of an uncompromising, right-minded foreign-policy critic, he will start talking about foreignersï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Winston Churchill usually; sometimes and for special cases, Charles de Gaulle. Our history will, if pressed, provide our own examples of the vindicated, patriotic opposition figure. But the models and images and metaphors that are within range of our current-day collective memory, and which dominate our political culture, tend to run in another direction. In these little mental pictures, which are in their way the precedents and frame of reference for our discussions, very nearly everything to do with foreign-policy opposition is troublesome, reckless, wrong.</br></br>There is opposition as obstruction, personified in the figure of the elder Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge successfully thwarting Woodrow Wilsonï¿½Ûªs League of Nations dream. There is opposition as narrow-minded, provincial self-concern: the isolationists of the ï¿½Ûª30s. There is opposition as subversion, disloyalty and treasonï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the right-wing view of the Roosevelt-Truman legacy in the postwar years; and there is the corollary: opposition as precisely the kind. of. mean-minded attack that was made on that legacy, opposition, in short, as Joe McCarthyism. There is opposition as a kind of insubordinationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½General MacArthurvand his civilian eggers-on defying Harry Trumanï¿½Ûªs command in Korea. There is opposition as a mass of antiwar demonstrators, looking preternaturally shaggy and threatening and making obscene gestures on the TV screen.</br></br>On the other side, the images to be emulated and revered, we have of course the converted onetime isolationist Sen. Arthur Vandenberg, doing the responsible, bipartisan internationalist thing in the critical years after World War n. We have all those congressional committee chairmen, with whom an administration could consult and make policy and deal, and on whom a secretary of state could count for discretion, private guidance, public help.</br></br>The apogee of great political foreign-affairs ï¿½Û¢leadership in this country is not fairly summed up by a mindï¿½Ûªs-eye picture of Winston Churchill in early opposition. It is more nearly summed up in that famous photo image of John Kennedy and Ikeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½backs to us, heads slightly lowered, exuding grim solidarity as they walk along a path at Camp David where Ike had come after the Bay of Pigs debacle to demonstrate his one-for-all-and-all-for-one, bipartisan fellow-feeling for Kennedy and the country in distress. Not incidentally, Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater too had visited Kennedy for the kind of solemn talk and show-of-sup-port meeting that certifies true foreign-policy leadership in this particular scheme of things.
NEW YORK -- When it comes to investing, it pays to be right. But in publishing, it sometimes pays just to be scary.</br></br>Consider a couple of the decade's most popular titles: Paul Erdman's "What's Next? How to Prepare Yourself for the Crash of '89 and Profit in the 1990s." Or Douglas Casey's "Crisis Investing: Opportunities and Profits in the Coming Great Depression."</br></br>Never mind that these visions of financial Armageddon turned out to be wrong; both books were red hot.</br></br>But does anybody but the author's family remember broadcaster Myron Kandel's "How to Cash In on the Coming Stock Market BOOM!"? And how about the book economist A. Gary Shilling wrote with Kiril Sokoloff: "Is Inflation Ending? Are You Ready? A sober look at the prospects for a decline in inflation and how it affects your business and investments."</br></br>Mr. Kandel's bullish book came out in 1982 just before one of the strongest bull markets in history began. Mr. Shilling's 1983 book correctly foretold another of the decade's central investing themes: lower inflation. Yet neither, to be polite, was a publishing success.
Despite being on track to offer some of the lowest yields in history, this week's auctions of $66 billion in Treasury securities are likely to get strong demand because investors expect new Federal Reserve stimulus that will keep yields under pressure.</br></br>"These auctions are going to go very well," said Eric Green, chief U.S. rates strategist at TD Securities. "The path of least resistance is lower yields, and there is every reason to believe that perception of the Fed doing something will persist up to the [Fed's September] meeting."</br></br>Mr. Green said it wouldn't be surprising to see the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield fall toward 1.5% this year. It ended at a record low 1.917% late Friday, down from 1.986% Thursday and 2.000% a week earlier. Yields move inversely to prices.</br></br>The Treasury is scheduled to sell $32 billion in three-year notes Monday, $21 billion in 10-year notes Tuesday and $13 billion in 30-year bonds Wednesday.</br></br>Also, the euro zone's deteriorating sovereign-debt crisis is expected to help keep demand high for U.S. government debt.
Once upon a time, in the land that FDR built, there was the rule of "regulation" and all was right on Wall and Main Streets. Wise 27-year- old bank examiners looked down upon the banks and saw that they were sound. America's Hobbits lived happily in homes financed by 30-year- mortgages that never left their local banker's balance sheet, and nary a crisis did we have.</br></br>Then, lo, came the evil Reagan marching from Mordor with his horde of Orcs, short for "market fundamentalists." Reagan's apprentice, Gramm of Texas and later of McCain, unleashed the scourge of "deregulation," and thus were "greed," short-selling, securitization, McMansions, liar loans and other horrors loosed upon the world of men.</br></br>Now, however, comes Obama of Illinois, Schumer of New York and others in the fellowship of the Beltway to slay the Orcs and restore the rule of the regulator. So once more will the Hobbits be able to sleep peacefully in the shire.</br></br>---</br></br>With apologies to Tolkien, or at least Peter Jackson, something like this tale is now being sold to the American people to explain the financial panic of the past year. It is truly a fable from start to finish. Yet we are likely to hear some version of it often in the coming months as the barons of Congress try to absolve themselves of any responsibility for the housing and mortgage meltdowns.
A divided Howard County Council yesterday approved a $289.1 million budget for local government that restores about $1 million to schools while holding the property tax rate steady.</br></br>Council members voted 3 to 2 along partisan lines to boost education spending by taking $600,000 out of a $1.2 million road resurfacing fund proposed by County Executive Charles I. Ecker (R), and another $400,000 from an array of special restricted accounts.</br></br>The council's three Democrats voted in favor of the final budget, while its two Republicans were opposed.</br></br>"More dollars don't necessarily mean more education," said council member Charles C. Feaga (R-District 5). The schools "are not a sacred cow. They don't need to get everything they ask for."</br></br>The council's action left the Board of Education with $2.3 million less than it had asked for originally. School officials are scheduled to decide June 1 how to absorb the shortfall.
In a year when the Real Thing took a beating, timing was everything.</br></br>Many beverage analysts were caught flat-footed when Coca-Cola's growth rate started to fizzle because of turmoil in overseas markets. Coca-Cola, a perennially popular stock, rose 33% from January to July and then lost nearly its entire gain in the second half of the year. The company's 1.4% gain for the year, including reinvested dividends, helped depress the overall return for many a stock picker.</br></br>Unless you were Timothy Swanson, a 32-year-old analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. Mr. Swanson was able to catch the wave of buoyant optimism for Coca-Cola in the first half of the year, before cutting his rating in mid-July, capturing a nifty 31% return. And in August, when many investors were bailing out of the stock of Coca-Cola Enterprises, the company's largest bottler, Mr. Swanson saw it as a cheap buy, riding that stock for 36% before jumping off.</br></br>As a result, the three-time All-Star's 36% estimated overall return easily trumped the 11% median return for the 14 analysts evaluated in the survey.</br></br>To a great extent, Mr. Swanson's calls were based on macroeconomic trends. With one international economy after another falling into recession, he felt that Coca-Cola, which gets 75% of its earnings from foreign markets, was too vulnerable. "It had a great run, and it was time to take a respite," says Mr. Swanson, who likes to compete in triathlons.
The 2,500 layoffs that ended in July at the Motorola cell phone manufacturing plant are still fresh in the minds of residents of this town of 8,000 just south of the Wisconsin border.</br></br>Motorola Inc. factory had been here just five years and employed some 5,000 workers. Restaurants like Nick's Cozy Nook -- where daily soup-to-dessert specials cost $4.95 -- filled up with Motorola workers during breakfast and dinner breaks.</br></br>"We had so many good years in a row. Everyone knew [a downturn] was coming, but we really were not ready when it got here," he said. "There were a lot of couples who had just bought a house, or couples that had just got married or had children."</br></br>With the latest figures showing an unexpected surge in the nation's unemployment rate to 4.9 percent, there is anxiety throughout the American heartland that the good times are indeed coming to an end. The downturn goes beyond stock market losses and the dot-com crash, worrying manufacturing workers across the country.</br></br>"It's a very nervous feeling out there these days," said Margaret Blackshere, president of the Illinois State Federation of the AFL- CIO. "The security of the industrial sector is long gone. Even with the boom in the building sector, they are all nervous. They're wondering, 'Can we plan?' and 'Am I going to have a job next week?' "
The economy is adding jobs so slowly, according to a report issued yesterday by tire Labor Department, that many financial analysts believe the Federal Reserve likely will soon decide to cut short-term interest rates.</br></br>The report said payrolls rose by 166,000 last month, but officials at the Labor Department said that except for a couple of statistical quirks the number would have been below 100,000. Private and government employers have been adding just over 100,000 workers a month to their payrolls since August, a Wring pace less than overall growth of the labor force.</br></br>Meanwhile, the nationï¿½Ûªs unemployment rate ticked up to 5,6 percent last month from 5.5 percent in October, as the monthly survey of American households found fewer people with jobs and more looking but unable to find them.</br></br>"The November employment report confirms other data pointing to sluggish [economic] activity,ï¿½Û said Bruce Steinberg, macroeconomics manager at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "We expect the Fed to ease policy at the Dec. 19 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.ï¿½Û</br></br>That committee is the central bankï¿½Ûªs top policymaking group. It last reduced its target for overnight interest rates, to 5.75 percent from 6 percent, in July.
Investors, encouraged by lower interest rates, shattered the eight-day-old trading record on the New York Stock Exchange and pushed up the Dow Jones Industrial Average another 7.52 points.</br></br>Shortly after the New York exchange closed at 4 p.m. yesterday, the Federal Reserve Board gave further-momentum to the drop in interest rates that has sparked the marketï¿½Ûªs climb. The nationï¿½Ûªs central bank cut the discount rate it charges financial institutions that borrow from it to 10 percent from 10ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½/2 percent.</br></br>interest rates. By itself, however, the discount rate cut does not necessarily indicate that the Federal Reserve wants rates to fall further, analysts said.</br></br>The Fed itself said the rate was cut in order to bring it ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½into better alignment with short-term interest rates.ï¿½Û It was the fourth time in six weeks that the Fed has lowered the rate, which stood at 12 percent at the beginning of July.</br></br>Nearly 138.5 million shares of stock changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, as such institutions as insurance companies and pension funds continued frenetic trading. The previous record trading day whs Aug. 18, when 132.7 million shares were bought and sold.
NEW YORK, July 22 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock market prices swept higher again today amid lively trading. A flurry of late profit taking could not restrain the market from stretching yesterdayï¿½Ûªs gains.</br></br>Motor, aircraft, electronics and aluminum shares featured the advance which added fractions to a point or so to key Issues.</br></br>Steels, a pacesetter in yesterdayï¿½Ûªs upswing, sloughed off a bit but still managed to ring up some gains.</br></br>Trading, which again quickened as the market advanced, moved at the fastest rate in more than a week. In all, 3,310,000 shares changed hands against 2,950,000 yesterday.</br></br>Investor interest was promoted by such market stimulants as a flock of rosy corporate earnings reports and news the cost of living hit a new-high in June, brokers said. The market spurted ahead in early trading and then coasted a bit lower until mid-afternoon. Some stocks inched higher before the profit taking set in near the close. - The Associated Press average of 60 stocks advanced 80 cents to $231.90 with industrials adding $1.20, rails 50 cents and utilities 30 cents. The Dow Jones industrial index ran up 2.90 to reach a new peak of 664.38. Eleven of the 15 most active stocks pushed higher. Three receded and one ended unchanged.
The office at Fairfax County Circuit Court that handles land-related transactions is buckling under the county's booming housing sales and failing to meet legal obligations, according to court officials.</br></br>"The massive development in the county, coupled with the interest rates being low . . . have just inundated us," Glenn T. Dryden, chief deputy clerk of the Circuit Court, said yesterday.</br></br>Employes in the Land Records Division, which leads the Washington area and Virginia in work volume, are mentally and physically exhausted from the nonstop pace, Dryden said. He said the court had asked the Board of Supervisors to add two positions to the current 20 and extend seven temporary slots. The board is expected to approve the request Monday.</br></br>"It's just incredible," Supervisor Thomas M. Davis III (R-Mason) said of the frenzied pace in Land Records. "It's like the New York Stock Exchange."</br></br>The number of documents recorded in the Land Records Division through March of this year was 175,748, a 50 percent increase over the same period last year, said Joan Dumas, a division supervisor. Dumas attributes the increase to housing and commercial sales, the number of homeowners who are refinancing to take advantage of low-interest rates and the high residential turnover in the county, particularly among the large military community.
Yesterdayï¿½Ûªs sunshine brought sailors to the Potomac River for an outdoor fling, but the last Sunday of the decade did not break the high set in 1971.</br></br>On the final Sunday of the decade the air was filled with softballs and frisbees and joggers tossed aside their sweatsuits as hundreds of Washingtonians streamed out into the sunshine and temperatures reached a surprisingly warm 61 degrees.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½People better enjoy it now,ï¿½Û said a National Weather Service spokesman at Dulles International Airport. He predicted the temperature on New Yearï¿½Ûªs Day will drop to a high in the low 40s as a large cold front descends from Canada.</br></br>Those planning to celebrate the arrival of the 1980s can expect New Yearï¿½Ûªs Eve temperatures to be in the high 30s, after a daytime high of 52. the weather service said. There will be increasing cloudiness tonight, and a slight chance of rain.</br></br>Yesterdayï¿½Ûªs unseasonably warm weather fell short of a record, 1971 high by seven degrees, said Bill Miller of the weather serviceï¿½Ûªs National Air;

It runs counter to a budget package cleared earlier this month by the GOP-run Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.</br></br>President Reagan has signaled his intention to limit the October pay hike to 4.8 percent. And he wants to put federal-military retirees, who now get cost-of-living (COL) raises in March and September, on a one-raise-per-year cycle.</br></br>Both the Senate and House Budget committees sent reduced spending limits to the two ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½jurisdictionalï¿½Û committees, PO-CS and Governmental Affairs. The budget groups endorsed the 4.8 percent raise and the COL cutback. Governmental Affairs went along with the proposed changes. But the House unit, headed by pro-union Chairman William Ford (D-Mich.), says the 5:45 percent pay proposal (left behind by Jimmy Carter) is fairer to feds. By refusing to take action on the proposal to limit retirees to one COL adjustment every 12 months, the committee would keep the March and September raises intact.
Credit Suisse Group AG's ability to serve as a counterparty to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York hasn't been affected by the Swiss bank's criminal tax-evasion settlement reached earlier this week with U.S. authorities.</br></br>The New York Fed considered the bank's settlement and decided to continue its counterparty relationship with Credit Suisse, a New York Fed official said Wednesday. The official noted that Credit Suisse's settlement pertained to activities that didn't involve the bank's broker-dealer business, and that the bank has taken steps to address compliance issues.</br></br>The firm keeping its primary-dealer status is the latest example of how the criminal guilty plea that Credit Suisse reached with prosecutors is designed to minimize the collateral damage that historically flowed from guilty pleas or criminal convictions.</br></br>Primary dealers trade billions of dollars of government securities with the Fed every day, and must meet various broker financial requirements and other standards to participate.</br></br>Credit Suisse is one of 22 such firms. A spokeswoman for Credit Suisse declined to comment.
NEW YORK -- Two large ratings services said the number of debt-rating upgrades exceeded downgrades in 1993 for the first time in almost a decade, with the banking sector showing particularly strong credit-quality improvement.</br></br>Standard & Poor's Corp. attributed the gains to lower interest rates and corporate belt-tightening. Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it expects speculative-grade ratings to lead the positive trend in 1994.</br></br>S&P said that for the first time since 1980, the number of corporate upgrades outpaced downgrades. Upgrades, the agency reported, totaled 343, compared with 263 downgrades. In dollar volume however, ratings were lowered on $243 billion of debt and raised on $130 billion because the ratings of several large issuers were lowered, S&P said.</br></br>Companies that saw their ratings lowered include General Motors Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and American Express Co., S&P noted.</br></br>Moody's also reported a higher volume of upgrades for the first time in nine years. In 1993, Moody's raised ratings of 163 companies, while lowering ratings of 154 corporations. This compared with 227 downgrades in 1992 and 136 upgrades.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>NEW YORK -- Consolidation may pick up in the U.S. mortgage industry, as companies seek to deal with a drop in refinancing activity after last year's boom.</br></br>Some smaller combinations so far this year -- including the $6 billion merger of Alabama-based Regions Financial Corp. and Tennessee- based Union Planters Corp. -- could herald a wider trend, analysts say.</br></br>"We're in a new phase in the mortgage industry right now, but it's a natural progression, given where interest rates are headed," said Sharon Haas, managing director in Fitch Ratings' banks group. "I am anticipating many more consolidations going forward."</br></br>Consolidation was under way well before the latest mortgage boom- and-bust cycle. But as the economy continues to recover this year, rates are expected to climb. That will erode new lending and refinancing activity, while pressuring firms to find new efficiencies, analysts say.
Some people look forward to daylight savings time. Others await baseball's opening pitch. Loop Fans, of course, look forward to the annual presentation of the "Congressional Pig Book," with its listing of the most egregious pork-barrel projects from this year's appropriations bills.</br></br>The 12th annual rollout on Tuesday, complete with hogs of the four-legged variety and a list of the "Dirty Dozen" -- 12 states that have received the most pork per capita from 1995 to 2002 -- promises to be the best ever. That's because we're hailing record- breaking amounts of pork, 8,341 projects, and a record total of $20.1 billion in chops, ham, roasts and bacon, according to the watchdog group Citizens Against Government Waste.</br></br>$14 million for the appropriately named Hollings Marine Laboratory in South Carolina -- as in Sen.

Doctorsï¿½Ûª fees rose 7 percent, or three times the rate of inflation, from March 1985 to March 1986ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the year after the American Medical Association ended a voluntary freeze on physician rates, federal statistics show.</br></br>An AMA spokesman says the fee increases were justified by an 8 percent jump in the cost of running a doctorï¿½Ûªs office during that time. But a consumer group labeled the rise in doctorsï¿½Ûª fees as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½gouging as usual.ï¿½Û The AMA's freeze, which began in March 1984, succeeded in bringing down the rate of increase for doctorsï¿½Ûª services, said Daniel Ginsburg, a U.S. Labor Department economist.</br></br>According to the latest figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, doctorsï¿½Ûª fees rose 7 percent in the 12 months after the AMA freeze ended in March 1985, compared with a</br></br>In establishing the voluntary freeze, the Chicago-based AMA urged the nation's 390,000 doctors to stop fee increases for a year to aid the nationï¿½Ûªs economy.</br></br>Dr. James Todd, the AMAï¿½Ûªs senior deputy executive vice president, defended the fee increases since the freeze ended. Doctorsï¿½Ûª fees still lag behind costs because the cost of operating a medical office rose 8 percent during the year, he said, largely because of increases of as much as 50 percent for malpractice insurance.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>The dollar was little changed versus the euro and the yen as a late- session climb carried the U.S. currency back to day-earlier levels.</br></br>After declining in Asia, the dollar traded in narrow ranges versus the euro for most of the European and North American sessions. However, a late-session rise in oil prices hurt the yen and some emerging-market currencies and helped lift the dollar back to the levels of late Tuesday, said Brian Garvey, currency strategist at State Street Global Markets.</br></br>The dollar's late rally also meant the U.S. currency held on to the gains it had made over the previous nine sessions versus the yen. Since Monday, the euro has recovered somewhat from last week's dollar advance, but weak Japanese data have kept the yen under pressure.</br></br>In late New York trading, the euro was at $1.2936 from $1.2924 late Tuesday. The dollar was at 107.53 yen from 107.52, and at 1.1980 Swiss francs from 1.2022 francs. The pound rose to $1.8803 from $1.8746, while the euro was at 138.86 yen from 138.93 yen.
WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department's December report on producer prices indicates that inflation remains well under control at the start of the new year.</br></br>The index of producer prices for finished goods rose a substantial 0.4% during the month, or 4.5% at a compounded annual rate, the Labor Department said. But like the larger increases in October and November, the December rise reflected a bulge in food and energy prices that most analysts believe is temporary. Excluding food and energy, producer prices held steady in December.</br></br>"We're entering the year on a very good note," said Joel Popkin, an economic consultant here. "These numbers certainly suggest there is a lot of room to grow before we face inflationary pressures."</br></br>Despite the price bulge during the last three months of the year, the producer price index in December stood only 1.8% above its year-earlier level.</br></br>Some forecasters have predicted that the roughly 20% drop in the dollar's exchange value since last February will cause inflation to accelerate by raising the prices of imports. But the latest producer price figures make it clear that, so far, the dollar's fall is having little effect on prices.
As investors return from the Labor Day weekend, they are preoccupied with one big worry: whether the enormous stock rally of the past six months can continue.</br></br>The days after Labor Day historically are a time to reassess and evaluate. The bottom line is that after a series of positive surprises in economic and corporate reports has pushed the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 44% since March 9, the stock market remains on precarious footing.</br></br>As long as the happy news keeps coming, the gains can continue. But the more good news investors get, the harder it is to surprise them, and the bigger the risk that some lurking disappointment could spoil the party.</br></br>"World economies are no longer 'on the brink of an abyss' and economic growth seems within reach," says Gordon Fowler, chief investment officer at Philadelphia money-management firm Glenmede Trust, in a report to clients. But consumers and government need to reduce their substantial debts, and that "has the potential to derail the pleasant uptrend."</br></br>The good news is that a whole series of items that appeared poised for disaster six months ago seem now to be getting steadily better.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>TOKYO -- In a surprise knock to Japan's economic recovery, growth decelerated during the April-to-June period amid a sharp slowdown in corporate capital spending.</br></br>Gross domestic product grew 0.4% in real, or price-adjusted, terms from the previous quarter, or 1.7% on an annualized basis, marking the fifth straight quarter of economic expansion.</br></br>That was much worse than the average forecast of economists surveyed by and Nikkei News of a 1% rise from the previous quarter and 4.2% annualized expansion, and also was below the 3% rise marked by the U.S. in the same period. Japan's second-quarter growth compares with revised 7.4% annualized expansion during the October-to-December period and a 6.6% rise during the January-to-March period.</br></br>However, economists said the disappointing figures didn't suggest the economy has entered a longer-term slowdown.
TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan, in a surprise announcement, said Friday it will lower the money-market interest rates it controls in an effort to boost economic growth.</br></br>The central bank, in saying it would usher short-term market interest rates lower, didn't disclose a specific target. But immediately after the announcement, Japan's key short-term money-market rate was trading at 0.8%, a record low. By lowering the cost of money, the move will encourage new bank lending and growth.</br></br>The move, which followed an announcement by the U.S. Federal Reserve that it would lower short-term interest rates, caused stock and bond prices to surge in Japan. At the end of the morning session Friday, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average was up 633.21 points, or 4.1%, to 15,890.10.</br></br>"This is a big, big move," said Marshall Gittler, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. in Tokyo. A surge in bond prices caused the yield on the benchmark government bond, an interest rate that falls as the bond's price rises, to hit a record low of roughly 2.5% in trading late Friday morning.</br></br>The move confirms the government is concerned that Japan's economy is teetering on the brink of recession. By one measure, gross national product, Japan already fell into a recession during the first quarter of this year.
NEW YORK, Nov. 26 (JP).ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market had its best session in a couple of weeks today as prices gained fractions to around a point.</br></br>The volume reached 1,180,000 shares, which is about the level of activity during most of last weekï¿½Ûªs sessions.</br></br>Many traders looked hopefully toward the traditional year-end rally. But they added the familiar rally may be offset to some extent this year by the new tax law which makes it advantageous to take long-term losses in 1952.</br></br>They explained the result of this new law would be some tax selling to establish such losses after the first of the new year.</br></br>The truce developments in Korea kept many traders cautious. There was a feeling that deflationary tendencies might follow the overseas negotiations.

WASHINGTON -- Minutes of the Nov. 7 meeting of the Federal Reserve's policymaking committee confirm that the Fed decided to ease its grip on credit to reduce the risk of a stalled economy.</br></br>All but one of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members -- Fed Governor Lyle Gramley -- agreed at the November meeting that the Fed should relax its credit policy. The members also indicated a willingness to allow further easing in policy "in limited steps" if the economy and the money supply continued to grow at sluggish rates.</br></br>The committee lowered its target range for the federal funds rate to 7% to 11% from 8% to 12%. The fed funds rate is the interest rate charged by banks lending reserves to other banks and is watched closely by the Fed.</br></br>The committee also predicted that as a result of the October slowdown in money growth, M1 -- the narrowest measure of the money supply -- would grow at an annual rate of only 3% between September and December. That's below the Fed's target range of 4% to 8%. The committee agreed that more rapid growth in M1 "would be acceptable."</br></br>The Treasury Department has criticized the Fed in recent weeks for keeping monetary policy too tight and for not allowing enough growth in the money supply to accommodate continued economic growth.
Federal Reserve policymakers, concerned about jittery financial markets, an unstable dollar, new inflationary pressures and conflicting evidence on the strength of the economy, will meet today to set a monetary course for coming weeks.</br></br>Some financial analysts expect the Fed to move soon to increase its 5*/2 percent discount rateï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the interest rate it charges on loans to financial institutionsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½to show its determination to control inflation and to help prop up the dollar. How- ever, other analysts believe Fed officials will be too wary about hurting economic growth to raise the key rate unless another drop in the dollar forces their hand.</br></br>In a series of interviews earlier this month, several members of the policymaking group, the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, indicated that they saw no need to make any major changes in policy.</br></br>Since FOMCï¿½Ûªs last meeting in March, some longer-term interest rates have risen more than lï¿½ï¿½ï¿½/i percentage points. Over the period the dollar fell sharply, sparking worries</br></br>among financial market participants of a surge in inflation and a tightening of monetary policy in response by the Fed. Yesterday the bond market initially fell, as it had on Friday, but rallied before the day was out. Analysts said the gain may have been due to a small rise in the value of the dollar and a decline in a closely watched commodity price index, which had been going up rapidly in recent weeks.
The euro regained some of its day-earlier losses against the dollar with a broad rebound in risk appetite but stayed within recent ranges.</br></br>Advancing U.S. stocks and crude-oil futures encouraged traders to buy riskier currencies and sell the safe-haven dollar. Crude-oil futures rallied above $70 a barrel for the first time in three days.</br></br>Also, many analysts said the dollar's relief rally against the euro on Wednesday, on what was perceived as a less-dovish Federal Open Market Committee policy statement, was misguided, as policy was essentially unchanged. However, the euro didn't advance far past the $1.40 level on Thursday.</br></br>A third suspected intervention in two days by the Swiss National Bank to weaken the franc may have weighed on the euro, some analysts said.</br></br>Market uncertainty remains high amid mixed economic data. Thursday's slate included better-than-anticipated revisions to the U.S. first-quarter gross domestic product but also a jump in jobless claims last week.
MEXICO CITY -- The catalog of repossessed properties could come straight from the pages of the U.S. savings-and-loan debacle. Mexican banks are trying, with little success, to unload collateral from low-quality loans on everything from abandoned pig farms to luxury condominiums.</br></br>But for Mexico, this is no mere S&L crisis: It's much worse. Mexico's banking disaster has wounded nearly every one of the country's 18 largest banks. And while the S&L debacle cost American taxpayers the equivalent of about 3.5% of the U.S. 1991 gross domestic product, analysts at Standard & Poor's Corp. say the bill for Mexico's mistakes could total 12% of the country's 1995 economic output.</br></br>The banking crisis is exacerbating Mexico's deepest recession on record, touched off a year ago by a botched devaluation of the peso. Mexican bankers are afraid to lend more money until they see signs of a recovery. Yet unless the bankers turn on the taps again, there's little chance the economy will pick up.</br></br>That is troubling for the U.S. as well. If Mexico's economy stagnates further, more illegal immigrants are likely to head north. Mexico is America's third-largest trading partner. And President Clinton's financial rescue of Mexico last March -- which included billions of dollars in backstops to prevent Mexico from defaulting on short-term debt -- has deepened the U.S. stake in its economy.</br></br>Less obvious than the economic consequences, but potentially more pernicious, is the damage to the cause of Mexico's free-market reform. The privatization of the banking system in the early 1990s was a key part of Mexico's effort to reverse decades of state control. But analysts now say the total cost of the bailout could soar beyond the $12 billion the government realized from its bank sales in the first place.
The basic reason President Ford defied conventional political logic to cast his second veto of a bill to control strip-mining was summed up in private advice from Dr. Arthur Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.</br></br>Burns, the nationï¿½Ûªs independent central banker, is not a member of the administration. But his views are respected by Mr. Ford, and he often attends White House councils. He was present at one of the two sessions discussing the strip-mining bill and was asked his opinion. His pithy reply: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Mr. President, I donï¿½Ûªt think we ought to be doing anything now to , increase the imports of oil.ï¿½Û</br></br>If Mr. Ford had lingering doubts, that probably resolved them. As Burns indicated, the veto was essentially an energy decision ruling out interference with coal production as an alternative to oil. That ahows how deeply the President has become committed to the energy question, giving replacement of oil by other energy sources priority over politically popular environmental questions. Thus, officials in the Federal Energy Administration (FEA) view the strip-mining veto as more Important than raising the oil import tax another dollar. In fact, they view it as the Presidentï¿½Ûªs most important energy decision so far.</br></br>Beyond energy, the veto suggests a toughened presidential style following , the Mayaguez incident. Mr. Ford was earning away from his congressional style of conciliation by vetoing the bill In the face of popular support, mixed Republican attitude* in Congress and deeply divided advice with-in his own administration.</br></br>Divided though that advice was, there was no doubt among FEA officials, Contending that recently enact- ed state regulation prevents the environmental outrages of oldtime strip-mining, they shuddered over 8,000 new federal regulatory bureaucrats. More important, they considered vital a precedent of Mr. Ford's giving energy priority'over environment in a forthcoming series.-.of such choices.
Hagerstown, already buffeted by the winds of economic recession, got more bad news last week when Fairchild Industries announced plans to close its main aircraft plant there by the end of the year, throwing 1,000 employes out of work.</br></br>But Hagerstown officials say that while their little Western Maryland town may be ill, it is not dying. As the adjacent map and legend below shows, ï¿½Û¢ Hagerstown is surrounded by dozens of viable industries in a tri-state area that feed its economy and provide work for its citizens. And Hagerstown officials are betting their community is likely to live as long and maybe as well as some of its healthier brethren.</br></br>HAGERSTOWN, Mdï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Hold the flowers. Cancel the wreaths. This little town in Western Maryland is rather ill, but it is not dying. And community officials are betting their town is likely to live as long and maybe as' well as some of its healthier brethren.</br></br>In view of some of the current statistics, that might seem a foolhardy prognosis. About 14 percent of the labor force here is unemployed, out of a population of 34,132 people. In Washington County, of which Hagerstown is the county seat, the unemployment rate is 12.3 percent. (The latest figures available show the national unemployment rate was 9 \h percent in July and August, while the metropolitan Washington areaï¿½Ûªs rate, which is not seasonally adjusted, was 5 percent in July.)</br></br>And then there was last weekï¿½Ûªs bad news. Fairchild Republic Co., a division of Fair-child Industries, announced plans to close its main aircraft plant here by the end of the year. Some 500 workers will keep jobs in two smaller, local Fairchild operations. But another 1,000 workers will join the ranks of the unemployed.	~

For much of this year, investors have been in love with health-care stocks, and for a very simple reason: In a tough economy, health care seemed one of the few sure growth industries.</br></br>After all, people still get sick, we're all getting older and feebler, and most of us don't pay our medical bills anyway - our employers or insurers do. So what's to stop the health-care profit train?</br></br>The answer to that formerly hypothetical question has been coming home in spades in recent months, as Wall Street has shot down a host of highflying medical stocks in rapid succession. In each case, the root cause of the stock's decline was a sudden concern about eroding profitability - or about the lengths to which the company must go to ensure decent profit growth.</br></br>The latest casualty was Santa Monica, Calif.-based National Medical Enterprises, whose stock plunged $4.12 1/2 to $16.12 1/2 Monday, a 20 percent drop in a matter of hours, though it recovered a bit to $17.12 1/2 by Friday. The hospital giant disclosed that some of its psychiatric hospitals are under investigation for alleged excessive or fraudulent billing.</br></br>But even before that, shares of many health maintenance organizations have languished after being trounced on profit worries.
Federal agencies are examining allegations that Regions Financial Corp. improperly classified loans that went bad during the financial crisis, according to depositions filed as part of a civil lawsuit against the large southeastern U.S. bank.</br></br>The new government inquiries about Regions Financial include subpoenas from the Securities and Exchange Commission, Regions Chief Financial Officer David Turner said in a July 20 deposition. Another former executive testified on Sept. 17 that the Federal Reserve had deposed him about the bank's practices, and he answered additional questions from the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Alabama Banking Commission and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SigTarp, the federal watchdog created to oversee the government's investments in troubled financial companies.</br></br>Regions Financial, SEC, the Federal Reserve, FBI, SigTarp and the Alabama Banking Commission declined to comment. Mr. Turner declined to comment through a Regions spokeswoman.</br></br>The depositions -- unsealed by a federal judge in the company's headquarters city of Birmingham, Ala., earlier this month -- indicate widening U.S. scrutiny of the lender as regulators and federal investigators step up their surveillance of the methods banks use to classify loans or reserve for losses.</br></br>Two transcripts filed earlier this month in a separate civil lawsuit against Bank of America Corp.'s Countrywide Financial unit show the SEC asked employees about the repurchase of defective loans Countrywide sold to investors before the housing bust. Both Bank of America and the SEC declined to comment.
The Federal Reserve has acquired more than $1 trillion worth of mortgage-backed securities in the past 15 months. At their policy meeting in the coming week, Fed officials will try to decide how and when to get rid of them without jarring financial markets and the nascent economic recovery.</br></br>The Fed's thinking on interest rates is straightforward. The recovery has gained traction but hasn't been vigorous or long lasting enough to warrant raising them soon; after its Tuesday and Wednesday meeting it is likely to repeat its signal that rates will stay low for an "extended period."</br></br>The more challenging issue will be agreeing on a long-term plan to shrink a balance sheet bloated to $2.38 trillion -- more than double precrisis levels -- according to Fed insiders.</br></br>Sales of mortgage-backed securities aren't likely soon. It is also possible that the Fed won't signal its intentions on the matter in its post-meeting statement Wednesday. But markets are on edge because its mortgage bonds holdings are so large. At $1.1 trillion in holdings of mortgage debt guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae, the Fed owns roughly a fifth of all these outstanding instruments.</br></br>The sheer size of the portfolio makes these decisions so key. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates Fed purchases of mortgage and Treasury bonds pushed long-term interest rates down about half a percentage point. The mere announcement of sales could have the opposite effect, as investors price in future sales.
WASHINGTON -- Consumer prices rose 0.5% last month, the Labor Department reported, a marked slowdown from their 1.1% surge in January but still disturbingly high to a number of economists.</br></br>A record 18.7% drop in fuel-oil prices helped hold down the overall price level, but a sharp, 3.3% jump in clothing prices kept inflation higher than many analysts had hoped.</br></br>The department's latest consumer price index, which measures the average change in the retail price of a fixed basket of goods and services, shows that the inflation rate seems to be recovering from a bitter cold-weather shock this winter. In January, catapulting food and energy prices drove the index up 1.1%, its largest monthly increase in more than seven years. The record drop in heating oil prices last month followed a 26.3% jump in January. Overall energy prices fell 0.7% in February after jumping 5.1% in January. Food prices, which soared 1.8% in January after the cold wave destroyed crops, grew 0.5% in February.</br></br>Many economists said that despite the retreat from January's sharp advance, February still leaves inflation worrisomely high.</br></br>"I think this shows inflation is a very stubborn problem," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. "There is simply no evidence as yet that the Federal Reserve has been able to bring down the core rate of inflation."
NEW YORK, Feb. 13 (AP)ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Late strength in steels and rails helped the stock market score its second biggest advance of 1963 today. Trading was fairly heavy.</br></br>The market was higher all day, with Chrysler providing the outstanding highlight of an advancing motor group. Steels did not come to the fore 'until about the final hour when they ran up substantial gains. Rails went along with them.</br></br>Brokers said it seemed to be a case of belated recognition that latest weekly steel production was the highest since April and that new steel orders were coming in at the heaviest rate in 11 months.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 2.2 to 258.9 with industrials up 3.6, rails up 1.5, and utilities up .3; both the utilities and rails making new 1962-63 highs.</br></br>Buying of rail shares was further stimulated by the fact that the rail component of the Dow Jones averages, rising 1.78 to 153.64, scaled the significant hurdle of the 1961 high of 152.92.
ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½There is a profound and pervasive commitment in this country today to not letting anything happen. ï¿½Û</br></br>Personalities and political theology dominate the Washington news as the Reagan Cabinet heaves into viewï¿½ï¿½ï¿½lots of talk about moderates versus conservatives and supply-siders versus traditionalists and the rest. It all matters, but not decisively. What will matter decisively to Ronald Reaganï¿½Ûªs prospects for success is something else: whether he will be able to take on and, to some extent, defeat that great decadent inertial force that characterizes so much of our governmental (and intellectual) life today.</br></br>Do I mean the Washington bureaucracy? Well, yes, in a wayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½but that is only part of it. I mean as well a collection of impulsesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½to trivialize, confound, procrastinate, fog over and subvert both thought and actionï¿½ï¿½ï¿½that are at work in many more bureaucracies than just the one on the Potomac that everyone complains about.</br></br>There is a profound and pervasive commitment in this country today to not letting anything happen. It (whatever is the problem at hand) is routinely declared to be much more complex than that (ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½thatï¿½Û being whatever the proposed solution may be). So, instead, it is ; duly noted that the situation must be | studied and made the subject of conferences and reports and hearings and pilot | projects and citizensï¿½Ûª lobbies and benefit ! galas and maybe, with a little luck, it will end up getting a presidential commission or even a Cabinet department of its own.</br></br>Then everyone can settle back and make the situation, whatever it was, a little worse, and get paid for it.
Voices is an occasional column that allows wealth managers to address issues of interest to the advisory community. Valerie Porter is the director of the Financial Planning Association's Research and Practice Institute, as well as president of SummitView Financial in Indianapolis.</br></br>In 2012 I started working as a consultant for the Financial Planning Association. FPA was interested in creating a Research and Practice Institute to gather information about practice management for its 23,000 members. There are lots of tools and resources available online for financial planners, but little empirical data regarding how advisory firms are actually run.</br></br>A lot of advisers are great technicians, or great at planning or investments. But many struggle with the business side of their practice. So we created quarterly surveys to ask advisers about the technical aspects of practice management such as their time management and productivity. Our goal is to use the responses from quarterly surveys to identify how advisers can become better business people.</br></br>The first pilot survey was conducted in the fall of 2013. It was designed as a broad baseline study, to get a feel for what's happening in the industry overall as it relates to practice management. We'd hoped to receive 1,000 responses to this first survey, but we received 2,400, which indicated a big interest.</br></br>This inaugural study showed several performance-related gaps. Advisers agreed that effective time management is important to their business success, but that they struggle in this area. For example, most advisers don't have formal practices and systems in place to ensure for efficiency. Additionally, younger advisers and female advisers indicated that they had no access to a formal training system geared specifically toward them and that they would be interested in participating in one.
NEW YORK -- Chemical Bank said it's reducing interest rates on a variety of consumer loans.</br></br>But many banks are still holding back, bringing down consumer borrowing rates slowly, if at all.</br></br>Chemical said it is reducing its annual rates for fixed-rate home equity loans to 13.9%, plus three points, from 14.9%; for fixed-rate unsecured personal loans of more than $5,999 to 16.5% from 17.25%, and for fixed-rate new-car and boat loans of more than $5,999 to 14.5% from 14.9%. Points represent a one-time payment to a lender, with each point equal to one percentage point of the face amount of the loan.</br></br>Banks in general have kept many consumer loan rates high, despite steep drops in interest rates they charge business borrowers and in rates consumers get on deposits.</br></br>The reduction in consumer loan rates at Chemical, a unit of Chemical New York Corp., the nation's sixth largest bank holding company, "is a relatively big drop, but the key is whether the other major banks will follow," says Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a Miami Beach, Fla., newsletter that follows bank deposit and lending rates.
GE Capital, the lending arm of General Electric Co., sold a $6 billion four-part bond, leading a wave of investment-grade deals totaling nearly $18 billion from almost a dozen companies.</br></br>"The predicted flood of New Year new issue is arriving on schedule," said Jim Vogel, a financial analyst at FTN Financial Capital Markets in Memphis, Tenn. He said the calendar will include some catch-up deals from late November.</br></br>In addition to GE Capital, Enterprise Products Operating, Metropolitan Life Global Funding, Deutsche Bank AG, and Rabobank Nederland brought billion-dollar deals to market. Allegheny Technologies, ERAC USA Finance, Health Care Services, Royal Bank of Scotland Group and several others also lined up to sell debt on Tuesday.</br></br>The brisk pace of issuance wasn't limited to the U.S. BNP Paribas of France, ING Groep of the Netherlands and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria of Spain all sold debt in Europe.</br></br>"We'll see a short burst followed by a little silence as earnings season begins followed by yet another round of reasonably heavy issuance," said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Capital Markets.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>TOTAL RETURNS for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reported in the Quarterly Mutual Funds Review on Jan. 7 were preliminary figures. The final figures are: 1998 fourth-quarter total return, 21.30%; one-year total return, 28.58%; three-year total return, 28.23%; five-year total return, 24.06%; 10-year total return, 19.21%. In addition, the cumulative five-year total return was 193.91%. The preliminary figures were provided by Lipper Inc. A table accompanying a Jan. 15 article on retirement-fund investing included some of these preliminary figures and wrongly indicated they were final figures provided by Morningstar Inc. (WSJ Jan. 28, 1999)</br></br>Wrapping up a year in which stock prices surged, swooned and then soared once more, diversified U.S.-stock funds ended 1998 with an average 14.52% total return.</br></br>That 1998 gain, as calculated by Lipper Inc. of Summit, N.J., is higher than many market watchers had expected at the beginning of the year -- and is right in line with the impressive 14.49% average annual gain for U.S.-stock funds over the past 15 years. But the 1998 advance was smaller than 1997's 24.36% average fund return and also lagged behind the 1998 gains of some widely watched market benchmarks.</br></br>The strong if unspectacular year-end number for stock funds obscures the high drama of mutual-fund investing in 1998.
Pg-PJ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br></br>OISO, Japan, Sept. 2 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ U.S. Special Trade Representative William Brock revealed tonight that the American trade deficit with Japan will be up almost 50 percent this year to $14 billion or $15 billion. He described this as an "enormousï¿½Û gap that is likely to restimulate protectionist pressures at home.</br></br>It was the first official estimate of the 198 L bilateral trade deficit with Japan, and Brock told a reporter that the larger deficit represented increased 'imports across the board, stimulated by a cheaper yen. This is one of the consequences of the soaring value of the U.S. dollar in response to high American interest rates.</br></br>high-level private gathering of Japanese and American leaders called the Shimoda Conference after the Japanese city where the first such meeting was held in 19.59. He is completing a swing of 10 southern Asian nations, which he said constitute ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the most exciting region in the world.ï¿½Û</br></br>Brock told the conference that the increasing Japanese trade surplus makes it imperative that this nation "open its markets much wider,ï¿½Û even though there have been substantial liberalizations of import regulations, some of which the American public does not know about.
Countries and concerns raised a record $80.3 billion in the Eurobond market last year -- an increase of nearly 68% from 1983 -- making it by far the largest capital-raising market outside the U.S.</br></br>That amount is likely to be exceeded this year. While relatively low inflation and declining interest rates in most Western economies favored Eurobond issuers and investors alike in 1984, many investment bankers are confident the new-issue business will accelerate, even if interest rates start rising.</br></br>"We see nothing but an explosion in business," says John M. Hennessy, president of London-based Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd., the leading underwriter of Eurobonds. "World savings aren't coming out of the U.S. for the next decade, so I guess we'll see a $100 billion Eurobond market in 1985," he adds.</br></br>For most borrowers, the lure continues to be unfettered access to a growing international savings pool that accommodates buyers and sellers in a market beyond the regulatory domain of any country.</br></br>"Every treasurer, from multinational corporations to the U.S. government, now considers the Eurobond market an important source for its funding because it's a freer market than any other," says Andreas Prindl, a London-based managing director at Nomura International Ltd., a unit of Nomura Securities Co., Tokyo.
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Globalization, the conventional wisdom goes, has downsides: It hurts the wages of the lesser skilled. It leads to large and possibly dangerous trade imbalances. It can threaten economic stability through financial-market volatility.</br></br>But academics, investment bankers and government officials at the Federal Reserve's annual symposium here heard a much more upbeat vision of a globally integrated world. For example, it is usually said that outsourcing work from a high-wage country, such as the U.S., to lower-wage ones -- also dubbed "offshoring" -- makes workers in the richer country's affected industries worse off, but the country as a whole better off, because consumers enjoy lower prices on the products made overseas. But Gene Grossman and Esteban Rossi-Hansberg of Princeton University argued that offshoring can lead to higher wages for unskilled U.S. workers.</br></br>"Things may be better than they would have been had there been no offshoring," Mr. Grossman said. When a company offshores some work, its remaining workers become more productive. It can thus expand, hire more workers -- perhaps even some of those whose work was offshored -- to do jobs that can't be offshored, and it can pay at least some of them more.</br></br>The proof is that wages of unskilled, blue-collar workers didn't do worse than they actually did between 1997 and 2004, given two strong, offsetting economic forces: the surge in productivity, or output per hour of work, which should have lifted their wages, and the decline in prices of imports, which should have pushed down their wages by lowering the prices of the competing goods these workers made.</br></br>Anthony Venables of the London School of Economics argued that when an industry in a rich country starts trading with a poor country, the wages in the rich country may actually pull further away from those in the poor country, instead of converging down to the lower level as standard economic theory predicts. The reason? The industry in the rich country may rely on many local inputs that its competitors in a new foreign market don't have -- access to specialized workers, for example, or daily face-to-face contact with competitors and customers.
J. VJ ï¿½Û¢ long. Hard bargaining has slowed or halted increases in large employersï¿½Ûª costs, but federal and state costs and payments by individuals continue to escalate.</br></br>In any case, competitionï¿½Ûªs effects on access and quality are likely to be dire. If market forces control health-care delivery, the number of uninsured and underinsured is certain to grow as employers restrict coverage of employees and early retirees and choice of providers.</br></br>Without legislative intervention, insurance companies will do more skimming. Free markets have no concern for equity, so the plight of the chronically ill, the poor and the unemployed will worsen.</br></br>Unless government intervenes, most regionsï¿½Ûª markets will be dominated by a few large entitiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½mostly investor-owned. These typically use 15 percent to 25 percent of premiums for corporate costs and profits, inevitably limiting services.</br></br>In theory, product quality in free markets is protected by informed consumer choice, but the reality of health care differs from economistsï¿½Ûª abstractions.
WASHINGTON -- Slower growth in credit-card debt and auto loans held the November increase in consumer credit outstanding to $2.22 billion, or a 4.4% annual rate, the Federal Reserve Board said.</br></br>Consumer credit rose a revised $2.88 billion, or a 5.7% pace, in October. Previously, the October increase was put at $3.74 billion.</br></br>"We may be seeing post-crash caution," said David Wyss, senior vice president at Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. "People got scared and thought maybe they shouldn't run up big credit-card balances. People are still buying but they're paying cash, un-American as that seems."</br></br>Auto loans, which account for about 40% of all consumer borrowing, increased $197 million in November after a $1.24 billion increase the month before. Mr. Wyss suggested that some auto buying in late November will be reflected in December credit statistics.</br></br>Revolving credit, which includes retail and bank-card debt and accounts for about 25% of all consumer borrowing, expanded $457 million in November after rising $1.44 billion in October.
An automobile industry spokesman told Congress yesterday that double overtime pay, if once tried as a weapon against unemployment, could never be abandoned. And he said it might actually reduce some workersï¿½Ûª employment.</br></br>xneoaore cj. rntema, vice president of Ford Motor Co., told a House Labor .ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½subcommittee that overtime at some seasons in the automobile industry and short hours at others balance out to a satisfactory annual income. Ynte-ma appeared as spokesman for the Automobile Manufacturers Association.</br></br>He said that once double pay instead of time and a half for overtime were instituted, it would be ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½such a juicy plum that unions would have to fight for it, both in collective bargaining and in their lobbying activities.ï¿½Û ;</br></br>The inevitable results, Ynte-ma contended, would be pressure to extend the system, inequities among individuals and business, inflationary price increases and dilution of the economic benefits of the tax cut.</br></br>President Johnson has proposed that double overtime be established in some selected industries on the recommen dation of labor-management public committees. The ides would be to encourage the hiring of more workers
Several of the nationï¿½Ûªs largest banks yesterday raised their prime rates to 121/> percent from 12 V\ percent, continuing a new upsurge in interest rates that some analysts fear eventually could stall any economic recovery.</br></br>The rise came as new figures from the Federal Reserve Board showed the nationï¿½Ûªs basic money supply climbed by $1.1 billion in the week ended Sept. 10ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a move likely to maintain pressure for interest rates to rise still higher.</br></br>Meanwhile, in a reflection of the recent jump in home mortgage rates, the government announced yesterday it is raising the maximum interest rate for FHA and VA mortgages to 13 percent, from 12 percent previously.</br></br>At the same time, the Fedï¿½Ûªs policymaking Open Market Committee disclosed it voted Aug. 12 to lower its third-quarter targets for the basic monetary aggregates in a further effort</br></br>Separately, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that the output of the nationï¿½Ûªs economy plunged more rapidly during the April-June quarter than it previously had thought, while the inflation rate was slightly higher.
WITH SOME MORTGAGE RATES at record lows, borrowers are starting to do something odd: They are agreeing to higher monthly payments.</br></br>An increasing number of affluent homeowners are swapping traditional 30-year mortgages for 15-year loans, which carry monthly payments that can be hundreds of dollars a month higher. In return, however, they're getting the lowest 15-year loan rates on record, and a chance to pay off their mortgages by the time their kids go to college or they retire. On top of that, 15-year mortgages carry far lower interest expense over the life of the loan. The shorter time frame can save a borrower more than $100,000 in total interest payments on a $200,000 loan.</br></br>The heightened interest in the shorter mortgages is yet another byproduct of the falling stock market. For homeowners capable of handling the higher monthly payments, the 15-year mortgages may present a more attractive use of extra cash than the market. In essence, they're choosing to pay off their debts rather than risking their money in the uncertain market or investing in low-yielding vehicles like savings accounts.</br></br>A year ago, "the last thing people wanted to do was pay more mortgage" each month, says Michael Menatian, president of Sanborn Corp., a West Hartford, Conn., lender. But now, he says, that has completely changed. "People are saying, `Where else am I going to put my money?' " Mr. Menatian says about a fourth of his refinance clients are opting for 15-year mortgages, compared with 10% last year.</br></br>It's easy to see why some borrowers might be tempted. Rates for a typical 15-year loan fell last week to a record low 5.93%, according to Freddie Mac. As recently as 1995, rates on 15-year loans were nearly 9.0%.
Americans have forgotten how to save in recent years.</br></br>First, we came to regard the stock market as our piggy bank; if we needed a little spending money, surely we could always sell a few shares of stock or a bit of a mutual fund at a profit. Then, we viewed our houses as money machines that would always provide a surplus of cash on a moment's notice, since real estate "never goes down in value."</br></br>All that has changed, at least for now. People finally have again realized how important it is to save. After all, thrift was once one of the quintessential American virtues: Just think of Benjamin Franklin intoning, "A penny saved is a penny earned."</br></br>Our ancestors knew what we had forgotten until recently: Unless you save, you cannot make your wealth grow. It's much easier to tell ourselves that our horse will come in at the racetrack, or that we will win the lottery if we just keep playing 4-7-10-14-36-51, or that some stock we heard about online is the next Google, or that we can simply use our credit cards to buy whatever we feel like today and pay it all back tomorrow . . . after our horse comes in at the racetrack.</br></br>But Benjamin Franklin was right when he wrote: "Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day."
NEW YORK -- Companies recently had to start swearing to the accuracy of their financial statements to keep regulators happy. Now, the owners of stock indexes might kick out companies that don't do so.</br></br>At least that is how it will work for the Nasdaq Stock Market's Nasdaq 100 index, a closely followed barometer of the market's large nonfinancial stocks -- an index that was the star of the tech-stock boom of the 1990s. Investors have about $30 billion linked to the Nasdaq 100 index, mostly through shares of the Nasdaq-100 Index Tracking Stock, an exchange-traded fund.</br></br>The yearly rebalancing of the Nasdaq 100 index is under way, and the index's members and candidates that can't attest to the honesty of their financial figures won't be allowed aboard.</br></br>The move -- whether more for symbolism or substance -- is the first of its kind among overseers of major indexes, with the Nasdaq's rule saying it will "prohibit securities from being included if the annual financial statements of the issuer of the securities cannot currently be relied upon."</br></br>Officials of Nasdaq, a unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, said they plan to police the requirement by monitoring companies' financial filings, keeping tabs on corporate news releases and by following comments made by company executives. It is understood that the market won't require the companies to file special affidavits with Nasdaq.
Independent presidential aspirant John Anderson, seeking to put as much distance as possible between .himself and Ronald Reagan, yesterday denounced the GOP candidate^ call for a tax cut of almost 30 percent over the next three years. Instead, Anderson called for a gradual program geared to progress in fighting inflation.</br></br>Reminded by his questioner1 on the television program ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Issues and Answersï¿½Û (ABC, WJLA) that he had supported the same Kemp-Roth tax proposal now a part of the GOP platform when he, Anderson, was a member of the Republican leadership, the candidate replied: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Time moves on; circumstances change. At that time inflation was 6 percent; today we have a core inflation of 10-11 percent. To compare the success of tax cuts in the Coolidge-Mellon or even the Kennedy-Johnson eras, as Mr. Reagan does, is to ignore the fact that the economy has developed some difficult structural changes.ï¿½Û</br></br>He rejected charges that he has frequently changed his mind on key issues. Anderson said were he elected he would not be as ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½rigid i and doctrinaireï¿½Û as Reagan. He would remain flexible but, on the other hand, would be more ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½consistentï¿½Û than Carter who, he noted, had produced two entirely new and different budgets within seven weeks and five different proposals for military spending in five months. .</br></br>Reaching out for a wider audience, Anderson attacked the GOP cut as an effort to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½try to sell a white collar tax cut to the blue collar workers of this countryï¿½Û and added, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I donï¿½Ûªt think this is the most equitable way of going about cutting taxes.ï¿½Û Under the GOP plan the minimum tax rata would be reduced from 14 to 10 percent; the maximum rate from 70 to 60 percent. This means a worker making $10,000 would get a tax cub of just over $100 a year while tho $50,000 family would get $1,000.</br></br>Anderson indicated a tax'cut was not a panacea per se for unemployment or the woes of the automobile industry. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I just donï¿½Ûªt believe that the kind of tax cut that has been proposed by Mr. Reagan is going to i be that effective in addressing the I problems of an industry that has clearly gotten into trouble because it hasnï¿½Ûªt produced the kind of cars the American people want to buy. Putting $100 or $1,000 into (taxpayers) | pockets isnï¿½Ûªt suddenly going to pro- ( auce a great bonanza for the auto industry.ï¿½Û
Stock prices fell in moderately active trading yesterday as investors ignored a continued advance in the bond market.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average bounced around in a relatively narrow range throughout the day, closing down 18.24 at 1945.29.</br></br>With stocks falling in Tokyo and London, traders in the U.S. had braced themselves for a big downswing as the opening bell was sounded on the New York Stock Exchange. Some were looking for a drop of as much as 100 points in the industrial average. The average declined, but only about 35 points. After selling stocks in their own markets, foreign investors unloaded some U.S. shares here early in the session, traders said.</br></br>Moves to lower interest rates by the Bank of England and several major British banks rekindled expectations of a coordinated global move by the U.S. and its major trading partners to reduce rates, analysts said. But Wall Street professionals are still looking for some kind of progress from Washington on a package to trim the federal budget deficit.</br></br>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 1.86 to 248.96, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index lost 1.00 to 139.11. The moderate losses for the widely followed market indexes were mirrored in the number of issues that rose and fell yesterday -- 933 declined and 713 advanced.
Small stocks rose for the second straight session yesterday as a wholesale-inflation report eased interest-rate jitters -- or at least put them off until today.</br></br>The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks rose 4.58, or 0.55%, to 837.12, eking out a gain of less than two points for the week so far, after a sharp fall on Tuesday. The S&P SmallCap 600 added 3.18, or 0.74%, to 435.03.</br></br>In particular, some small semiconductor stocks rose sharply. Among catalysts for the sector, Banc of America Securities raised its rating on large-cap Intersil's shares to "buy," saying Wall Street had underestimated the company's growth potential. Intersil rose $1.94, or 6.3%, to $32.75. Small-cap OmniVision Technologies added 54 cents, or 3.5%, to 15.96.</br></br>The producer-price index rose sharply in May, but "core" inflation, which excludes food and energy, was more subdued.</br></br>If core consumer inflation exceeds the average economist expectation of a 0.2% increase, Sean Simko, head of fixed-income management at SEI Investment, expects the 10-year Treasury yield to test the five-year highs above 5.25% set on Tuesday. As the yield is used as a benchmark for corporate borrowing, this would likely buffet small stocks, which are particularly dependent on the debt markets.
The Federal Reserve may have to accelerate the pace of tapering to take into account the economic pickup currently ongoing in the U.S. and the improving forecast for the near future, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said.</br></br>"We must back away from increasing the degree of policy accommodation in a manner commensurate with an improving economy," Mr. Plosser told a panel in Paris. "Reducing the pace of asset purchases in measured steps is moving in the right direction, but the pace may leave us well behind the curve if the economy continues to play out according to the FOMC forecasts."</br></br>Based on the latest gross domestic product numbers, the U.S. economy accelerated its pace of expansion in the second half of 2013 from the first half. Real output showed growth of 3.3% from 1.8% in the first half.</br></br>As the economic outlook improves, the Fed announced in January its second cut to its monthly purchase program to $65 billion. At the current pace, the FOMC will end the purchase program later this year.</br></br>But Mr. Plosser noted the pace may not be fast enough.
The chief executive of Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. said a revamped compensation plan for firms hit by glitches in the stock-market debut of Facebook Inc. represented the exchange company's "definitive" response to the debacle.</br></br>Robert Greifeld, Nasdaq OMX's CEO, reiterated Wednesday that the market operator has "substantial legal and factual defenses" against any litigation that may be brought by market makers and brokers that suffered losses due to Nasdaq OMX's problems bringing Facebook's stock to market May 18.</br></br>Nasdaq OMX late Friday unveiled an expanded $62 million, all-cash plan to pay back such firms for some of their losses after an initial proposal of $40 million, much of it in discounted trading fees, sparked an uproar in June from firms and rival exchanges.</br></br>"We believe this proposal reflects the hard work that went into it," Mr. Greifeld told analysts on a conference call to discuss the exchange operator's second-quarter results. "That's our definitive word on the topic."</br></br>Mr. Greifeld said that by formally submitting the payback plan to regulators, Nasdaq OMX, which prides itself on its technology, aimed to move forward from the embarrassment of the Facebook episode.
NEW YORK, June 1 (.ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½!*>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The stock market made a limited advance today in its quietest session in 316 months.</br></br>Prices improved in most divisions in the last half-hour after the market had held to a mixed position through most of the day.</br></br>Gains ran to better than 2 points in key I issues. Steels', motors, oils and chemicals were the best performers among the divisions.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stocks rose 40 cents to S178.60, with industrials up $1.00, rails off 50 cents and utilities up 40 cents.</br></br>Brokers attributed the slim volume to a combination of uncertainty over the current market picture and a pre-weekend letup in business after the Memorial Day holiday.
For the last five years, Katrin Clif lived in a single room with no bath, not even a sink. She was a sales clerk in a store that had nothing to sell, and she had a 2-year-old son with no toys and not much of a future.</br></br>Last Friday, in a small village near Potsdam in East Germany, Clif, 21, took out her only suitcase, put in clothes for herself and her son, and called her mother to say she was leaving, perhaps forever.</br></br>"My mother said, `You are young and you should be free,' " Clif recalled today. "We live only once. There is no going back."</br></br>Saying nothing to anyone else, mother and son left home, boarded a train and headed for the West. Clif had heard rumors of a breach in the Berlin Wall, but she was not sure whether to believe them, so she went to Czechoslovakia and crossed from there into West Germany and the helping hands of the West German Red Cross.</br></br>Now, less than 48 hours after leaving home, she is in the Rhine Valley village of Meckenheim, a place of apple orchards and pretty churches-in another Germany, another world. Clif and 842 other East Germans who have arrived here since Saturday are packed into a cavernous garage crammed with bunk beds, waiting for housing and jobs so they can begin new lives in a place they have seen only on West German TV, which almost all East Germans can watch.
Republicans already obsessing about the 2016 presidential sweepstakes have paid little attention so far to Rick Santorum. That's a mistake.</br></br>A mistake not because Mr. Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator and unsuccessful 2012 presidential candidate, is likely to win his party's nomination. He's a long shot if he runs again.</br></br>It is a mistake because Mr. Santorum has written a new book, "Blue Collar Conservatives," that shows he grasps two important realities that seem to escape many others. The first is that, outmoded stereotypes notwithstanding, blue-collar Americans, particularly working-class whites in the South and Midwest, today comprise a core element of the Republican Party. The second reality is that, because of the alienation these people feel from both the political and economic systems, the table is set for a new period of populism.</br></br>That helps explain why longtime private-equity executive Mitt Romney, though an accomplished and experienced figure, wasn't the ideal standard-bearer for the party in 2012, Mr. Santorum argues. More important, he says, these realities suggest Republicans need to rethink their policy focus going forward.</br></br>"We Republicans have neglected to focus our policies and our rhetoric on the plight of lower-income Americans," he writes. Later, he adds: "Our focus on tax cuts for individuals not only leaves us open to the 'tax breaks for the rich' sloganeering of the Left but seems irrelevant to the nearly 50% of the population who don't pay federal income taxes today."
Trailing in the polls with election day just four months away, Chancellor Helmut Kohl received a much-needed boost today from President Clinton, who heaped praise on Europe's longest-serving leader during a tour that had all the appearances of a political campaign.</br></br>After celebrating one of the defining moments of the Cold War by marking the 50th anniversary of the Berlin Airlift, at Tempelhof Airport, Clinton escorted Kohl aboard Air Force One for a short flight to Eisenach, a town in the former Communist part of eastern Germany where they toured a modern car plant built by General Motors Corp.</br></br>Clinton's visit was the first by a U.S. president to eastern Germany, and it was welcomed by Kohl, who lags far behind his Social Democratic rival, Gerhard Schroeder. In the 1994 election, Kohl's support among eastern voters helped him stage a dramatic comeback against Rudolf Scharping, a lackluster Social Democratic candidate. But this year, with unemployment in the east well over 20 percent, Kohl has become deeply unpopular and his Christian Democratic party's standing has plummeted in the polls.</br></br>Tossing his arm around the burly chancellor at every opportunity, Clinton sought to revive public esteem among eastern German voters for the man who linked them with the West with the reunification of Germany in 1990. "Thanks in no small measure to the leadership of your chancellor, Germany today is one nation, in harmony with its neighbors," Clinton told a packed town square, as a beaming Kohl reveled in the praise of his foreign guest.</br></br>During a foreign policy address Wednesday at Berlin's Schauspielhaus, a famous opera house located on what was once the Communist side of the Berlin Wall, Clinton extolled Kohl's record as chancellor for the past 16 years in terms that sounded like either an endorsement or a political eulogy.
BRUSSELS -- The world's seven major industrialized countries should meet soon to discuss "the present deterioration of the world economy" and the unusual disparity between U.S. and German interest rates, according to the head of the International Monetary Fund.</br></br>Economic growth is slowing, and "the world economy is at a turning point," Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said. He stressed the need for more discussion between the finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven industrialized countries: the U.S., Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.</br></br>Mr. Camdessus also urged trade ministers to reach a successful conclusion to their four-year trade talks, which are in their final week here. He said failure of the talks would be "extremely damaging" to IMF efforts to devise economic-reform programs in many countries, and would hurt both the industrialized and developing worlds.</br></br>In recent weeks, the French finance minister, Pierre Beregovoy, twice has sought U.S. support for a Group of Seven meeting. The U.S. Treasury so far hasn't publicly responded to these requests, although some U.S. officials point out that a G-7 gathering generally is held early each year -- in January or February.</br></br>"I'd be surprised if we didn't have {a G-7 meeting} soon," said Charles Dallara, the assistant U.S. treasury secretary for international affairs.
LONDON -- The poodle is biting back.</br></br>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was derided by satirists here as Ronald Reagan's "poodle" when in April 1986 she allowed U.S. planes to launch their attack on Libya from British air bases. While her international moniker has been "Iron Lady," here at home critics have cast her as America's faithful lap dog.</br></br>But she is now impatient with the Reagan administration because she believes the global financial crash -- and the ensuing uncertainty in financial markets -- threatens everything she has worked for in her eight years as prime minister. Yesterday in Parliament, she criticized American economic policy, saying she is "very anxious" for deficit-reduction negotiations between the president and Congress to succeed. "A convincing package to reduce the U.S. budget deficit is a vital first step towards restoring confidence in the financial markets," she said. The blunt public admonition followed a private message sent Wednesday to President Reagan.</br></br>After years of tough -- and politically unpopular -- retrenchment, Britain's economy is growing smartly. But if the current market turmoil continues -- and many analysts believe it will unless the U.S. slashes its budget deficit -- then Britain could be dragged into a world recession.</br></br>Mrs. Thatcher isn't without some influence over her pal, Ronald Reagan. The two have a mutual admiration society where most aspects of economic policy are concerned. But American officials aren't likely suddenly to clean up their economic mess just because Britain's prime minister has spoken. Her comments, and the more pointed statements of other British officials, instead show how peeved Britons are with American policy makers.

When the stock market took its mid-January cold shower we ventured the opinion that stocks don't fall for long on good news. And sure enough, a steady recovery capped by last Friday's strong performance has sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new high.</br></br>We assume investors and traders liked the strong December showing of the government's index of leading economic indicators, which seemed to confirm a general mood of optimism among economists. The latest numbers on insured unemployment showed a nice drop. News that sales of new homes rose 7.4% last year to the highest level since 1979 was further evidence that lower interest rates can do some nice things. And the market seems to have gotten over whatever jitters it had about the future trend in interest rates.</br></br>But perhaps even more interesting was the apparent willingness of the market to shrug off what some observers persist in regarding as bad news, the large trade deficit. December's record imbalance, exceeding $17 billion, sent the deficit for all of 1985 up to more than $148 billion, of which the Japanese, unsurprisingly, accounted for more than a third. One explanation of the market's unconcern is that securities traders know that many of those dollars earned by foreigners will be invested in the U.S. capital market.</br></br>Yet another reason the trade deficit failed to scare the markets is no doubt the perception that trade deficits are ultimately self-correcting. When the world begins to get satiated with dollars, the dollar softens, which is, of course, what has been happening since last fall. "J-curve" theorists explain that the initial effect of a softening currency is to widen the trade gap, since imports become more expensive and exports less remunerative. But the longer-term effect is to discourage importing and, all things being equal, make U.S. goods and services cheaper to foreigners.</br></br>This doesn't mean that a chronically soft currency is a good thing over the longer term. It usually implies inflation. But with oil prices falling of their own weight, the Federal Reserve has had a window of opportunity to let the dollar soften without inordinate inflationary risk.
NEW YORK -- Seldom has the economy so confounded forecasters. Who could possibly have imagined a year ago that overall business activity -- notwithstanding an unprecedented crash in the stock market -- would remain briskly on the rise in mid-1988? Who could have guessed that the expansion would be rolling relentlessly through a sixth straight year, with no end in sight?</br></br>Economists who failed to anticipate this durability may be tempted to despair, sensing that imponderables so overhang the business scene nowadays that forecasting has grown too hazardous an occupation. Indeed, they may be moved to seek safer work, like wrestling with alligators instead of numbers.</br></br>Before anyone sets out for the Everglades, however, it may be worth taking a retrospective look at the economy's recent behavior, for it's not as perplexing as one might suppose from all the tarnished forecasting records.</br></br>Expansion phases of the business cycle normally end only after a rising economy begins to bump against constraints to further growth. These constraints may be physical, as when labor or productive capacity proves insufficient to meet demand, or they may be financial, as when credit is too costly or simply unavailable.</br></br>This basic characteristic of the business cycle tended to be overlooked in the widespread concern last year, particularly after the October market crash, that a recession would soon set in, possibly by the start of 1988.
With the advent of superregional banks in Florida and Maine, bank customers are getting higher interest rates on deposits and new types of loans. But, some say, they also are getting less service, with the informal, personal touch that once characterized local banking vanishing along with local ownership.</br></br>For better or worse, out-of-state superregionals have changed the banking game in the two states. In Florida, more than 30% of the $86 billion in commercial-bank deposits are now held in institutions based out of state. In Maine, the five-biggest commercial banks, representing 85% of the banking assets, are owned by out-of-state institutions. Prior to 1981, there weren't any out-of-state banks in either state.</br></br>Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., newsletter, says out-of-state institutions have consistently paid Florida depositors higher interest rates and charged lower rates on consumer loans than Florida-owned institutions. Robert Heady, the newsletter's publisher, adds that the "intrusion" by out-of-state banks has spurred the remaining locally owned institutions "to raise {deposit} rates modestly." He concludes, "Florida savers have gotten a better shake as a result of the 'carpetbaggers' entering the state."</br></br>In Maine as well, out-of-state banks are paying higher rates on deposits than local ones do.</br></br>Business borrowers in Maine and Florida generally say they are getting a wider choice of financing terms since out-of-state institutions arrived.
Foreign stock markets went for a wild ride in the first quarter, spooked by fears of a slowing U.S. economy and the ripple effects that a downturn could have globally. But most foreign markets steadied by the end of the quarter, leaving investors with some hope that the four-year overseas rally remains intact.</br></br>The pullback began the last week of February amid signs that loans to the least creditworthy U.S. borrowers, known as subprime loans, were deteriorating. Investors worried that delinquencies in this corner of the property market could spread to the broader housing sector, damping U.S. consumer appetites for foreign goods and commodities. Global markets suffered their biggest one-day selloff Feb. 27, with blue-chip indexes falling between 3% and 7%, after a nearly 9% drop in Shanghai's main stock index further unsettled nerves.</br></br>"It was a pretty turbulent period," said Shigeki Makino, a senior portfolio manager at Putnam Investments in Boston. "Concerns about risk came back to the fore, and people reined in their riskier bets pretty quickly."</br></br>The Dow Jones Stoxx Index, which measures the performance of major European companies, advanced 2.5% in the quarter, Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average of 225 companies was ahead 0.4%, while Morgan Stanley's emerging-markets index edged up 1%. All did better than the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 0.9% decline.</br></br>But these return figures belied the price swings to start the year, and the sudden flight from riskier markets in late February. Latin America best exemplified the roller-coaster nature of the quarter. These stocks lost 5% during the first week of the year, bounced back 12% until Feb. 22, slid 12.5% during the next 10 days, then bounced back another 12% in the three weeks that followed.
NEW YORK. Sept. 1 MWThe stock market bounced up smartly today after dipping yesterday to a new low for the year.</br></br>The market started narrowly mixed and then improved slowly. In the afternoon the pick up in prices quickened and then continued to the close. There was, however, a letdown here and there in the list just before the bell.</br></br>The rebound today was anticipated on the basis that recovery very often follows a sustained fall after climactic selling of the kind encountered yesterday.</br></br>The market has been in a downward trend for the past two weeks. The movement is interpreted as the marketï¿½Ûªs adjustment to the lower business rate anticipated by Wall Street the remainder of this year and next.</br></br>The Associated Press average of 60 stacks gained 70 cents. It lost $2.20 yesterday. It now stands at $103.10. The industrial component of the average advanced $1.00, the railroads advanced 90 cents, and the utilities advanced 10 cents.
HEWLETT-PACKARD'S earnings jumped 66% in the fiscal third quarter, lifted by strong global demand for its computer products. Profit totaled $576 million, which was at the high end of expectations, and new orders were stronger than expected, indicating continuing strength.</br></br>Compaq cut prices 13% to 25% on personal computers aimed at corporate customers, and H-P said it would more than match the reductions. The jockeying comes as PC makers prepare for the release of Windows 95, which is expected to spark sales.</br></br>---</br></br>Housing starts rose 6.7% in July, their fourth straight advance and the biggest in 16 months, as buyers took advantage of lower mortgage rates.</br></br>---

The firm's finance chief took leave. The U.S. health department confirmed that T2 is one of several targets of investigations into possible Medicare fraud, involving possible kickbacks to doctors. T2's stock plunged $4.75, or 35%, to $8.875.</br></br>DuPont agreed to pay $4,250,000 to settle the first suit to reach trial alleging the chemical company's Benlate fungicide caused plant damage.

Management and union representatives of {ha coal industry told a Senate Labor Subcommittee yesterday importation of cheap foreign oil is causing serious unemployment in the coal industry.</br></br>They asked Congress to stem the oil being ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½dumped" in this country by ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½an international oil cartel.ï¿½Û They said if the coal industry is not protected it will not be able to meet the Nationï¿½Ûªs fuel needs in event of war.</br></br>The Subcommittee began an investigation into the causes of unemployment in such indus-i tries as coal, railroads, textile,! pottery, lead and zinc. Sen. Matthew M. Neely (D-W. Va.) is the groupï¿½Ûªs chairman.</br></br>Although Neely said the purpose of the hearings was to ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½strengthen" rather than ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½destroy or impair the principal of the reciprocal trade program,ï¿½Û opening statements made it clear that the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Administration program will figure largely in the investigation.</br></br>Walter R. Thurmond, secretary of the Southern Coal Producersï¿½Ûª Association, said the flood of foreign oil imports is having a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½devastating effectï¿½Û j upon the coal industry. He asked for the support of Con-! gress ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½against the unfair competition of foreign oil.ï¿½Û
Major banks cut their prime lending rates by one-quarter of a point to 8V2 percent yesterday, reflecting a recent decline in interest rates caused by expectations of a slowdown in the economy.</br></br>The reduction in the benchmark rate will trim borrowing costs for many corporate and individual borrowers, furnishing a bit of a stimulus to an economy that is certain to turn sluggish in coming months, economists said.</br></br>Reagan administration officials welcomed the banksï¿½Ûª move, which came amid growing worries that the economyï¿½Ûªs growth during the election campaign will be so anemic that Republican candidates will be hurt.</br></br>The banksï¿½Ûª action was prompted by a decline in the rates that the banks themselves pay on borrowed funds and on deposits. Those rates have been dropping because of the widespread expectation that an economic slowdown would diminish demand for loans by businesses and consumers. Additionally, the Federal Reserve is thought to be on the verge of easing credit conditions slightly, which is also helping to lower rates.</br></br>A fresh harbinger of a slowdown in the economy emerged yesterday when the Commerce Department reported that its composite index of leading indicators decreased in December for the third month in a row.
PITTSBURGH -- PNC Bank Corp., moving to reduce its vulnerability to rising interest rates, said it sold $1.8 billion in securities last month as part of a plan to shrink its investment portfolio by $5.9 billion by the end of 1995.</br></br>The bank-holding company said it will incur a $79 million loss for the fourth quarter from the recent sale of fixed-rate securities. It also said it won't replace a further $4.1 billion in securities that mature this year, reducing its total portfolio to about $17 billion by the end of 1995 from $22.9 billion at the end of the 1994 third quarter. The move will reduce PNC's total assets by 9.4%, to about $58 billion.</br></br>PNC indicated last fall that it would restructure its investment portfolio after steep interest-rate increases produced heavy securities losses. At the time, PNC said it expected those losses would cut 1994 fourth-quarter earnings by 7% and 1995 earnings by about 15%.</br></br>PNC isn't alone in selling securities because of rising interest rates. "I assume virtually everybody is," said Dennis Shea, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co. "Most banks are, I would believe, net sellers of securities right now. They're trying to reduce their liability-sensitive positions."</br></br>To further reduce vulnerability, PNC recently bought interest-rate swaps with fixed payments and interest-rate caps. The new swaps and caps will cost PNC about $70 million in 1995 if rates stay the same, said Thomas H. O'Brien, chairman, chief executive and president. If rates keep rising, the cost of the swaps and caps will drop.
Consumer confidence fell this month to a level usually seen only during recessions as American households' expectations about their economic future plunged, according to a report released yesterday.</br></br>Two other reports on last month's new orders for durable goods -- such as cars, appliances, computers and machinery -- and sales of new homes, showed much less weakness and were not nearly as disturbing to analysts as what has been happening to consumer attitudes.</br></br>Falling stock prices, high heating bills, worries about job prospects and a drumbeat of gloomy statements about the economy from Wall Street analysts, company executives and the White House have taken a big toll on consumers' expectations. If they were to pull back on their spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic output, the already weak economy could slide into a recession.</br></br>The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell to 106.8, down 25 percent from its level of five months ago. But the overall index is a composite of two measures of how consumers regard their present economic situation and what they expect it to be like six months from now. The present-situation index has declined 10 percent since September, while the expectations reading has plunged 40 percent.</br></br>"The erosion in consumer confidence continues to be fueled by weakening expectations regarding business and employment conditions," said Lynn Franco, director of the board's Consumer Research Center. "While the short-term outlook continues to signal a severe economic downturn, consumers' appraisal of current economic conditions suggests we are still undergoing moderate economic growth and not a recession."
Discover Financial Services proposed a 20% increase to the credit-card company's dividend and up to $1.6 billion in stock buybacks over the next year, moves that would need approval from the Federal Reserve.</br></br>The announcement comes as the lender was among 29 of the 30 largest institutions that the Fed said have enough capital to continue lending even when faced with a hypothetical jolt to the U.S. economy lasting into 2015.</br></br>The so-called "stress test" is an annual test of big banks' financial health, and positive views can clear the way for the companies to reward investors with dividends and buybacks.</br></br>Discover on Thursday said its proposed actions include an increase to the company's next quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share from 20 cents previously. It also intends to repurchase up to $1.6 billion in stock during the next four quarters ended March 31.</br></br>The company said the actions would be subject to a "non-objection" from the Fed later this month, and the dividend increase will also need approval from Discover's board.
WASHINGTON -- Surging imports from Europe and Japan caused the U.S. trade deficit to widen to $10.29 billion in January from $8.03 billion the previous month, the Commerce Department said.</br></br>The widening in January came despite a 3.3% decline in the value of petroleum imports, which are often volatile. Total imports rose 9.2%.</br></br>The large January deficit makes it clear that the easing of the nation's trade problems at the end of last year was temporary, reflecting a slowdown in imports as a result of sluggish economic growth in the third quarter.</br></br>Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said the 10% rise in the value of the dollar last year, plus the 9% jump since December, could push the deficit to a record $140 billion this year. The trade deficit in 1984 was a record $123.31 billion, compared with $69.39 billion in 1983, the previous record.</br></br>A strong dollar can widen the trade deficit by lowering the cost of imports to U.S. buyers and raising the cost of exports to foreign buyers. The problem is exacerbated by strong economic growth in this country, which encourages the purchase of foreign goods, and relatively sluggish growth overseas, which discourages purchases of U.S. products.
A string of problems at JWP Inc. has some analysts wondering if the company, which went on an acquisition spree just as the economy was heading into recession, didn't expand too much too fast.</br></br>In the past few months, the technical services giant has disclosed a chain of announcements that has sent its stock into a dizzying plunge, to a low of $5.75 in August from a high of $19 in January. It currently trades around $6 a share.</br></br>In April, JWP announced a $9.3 million charge to restructure a business; in July, it forecast a sharply lower profit outlook than analysts expected. And it subsequently reported a revised $13.9 million loss for the first quarter and a $48.8 million loss for the second quarter, after internal auditors raised questions about the value of assets in its information services unit; the charges totaled $64.5 million.</br></br>"JWP can't afford any more problems," says John Simon, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. The company in a sense agrees. "We tried to do too many things, tried to be good at too many things," says Andrew Dwyer, chairman and chief executive. But he insists "we certainly think all the bad news is behind us," and JWP now will be able to focus on its core business and rebuild earnings.</br></br>JWP acts as a subcontractor and superintendent to companies: it designs, installs and services a variety of electrical and mechanical systems -- from computerized lighting and security systems to plumbing, cooling and heating systems -- for everything from hotels to power plants.
Global demand worries pummeled oil prices in early Asia trading on Tuesday, with light, sweet crude for September delivery falling nearly 5% to a 11-month low of $76.56 a barrel, 33% off its April 29 high, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</br></br>This followed a drop of $5.57, or 6.4%, to $81.31 a barrel in New York on Monday, a reaction to Standard & Poor's downgrade of U.S. debt on Friday.</br></br>Brent crude on the ICE futures exchange on Monday settled down $5.63, or 5.2%, to $103.74.</br></br>The declines mark a steep drop from levels reached earlier this year. Benchmark crude in the U.S. shot to nearly $115 a barrel in May.</br></br>At the time, the U.S. economic recovery appeared more stable, while the civil conflict in Libya spurred fears of widespread supply disruptions among major oil exporters.
Critics of the U.S. position in the Framework talks with Japan question their central premise namely, that Japan's distinctive trading behavior harms its partners. Often such criticisms begin by pointing out that the bilateral trade imbalance between any two nations does not matter. But the bilateral imbalance between the U.S. and Japan is not what the talks seek to remedy. Rather, they are designed to address Japan's multilateral current-account surplus and structural barriers to Japan's markets, both of which matter very much to Japan's trading partners.</br></br>Japan is currently running a current-account surplus of about $130 billion, or 3% of its gross domestic product. This huge surplus depresses global demand and slows the pace of economic expansion and job creation in other nations. A reduction of $50 billion in Japan's multilateral trade surplus -- which would still leave Japan with a current-account surplus of $80 billion, or about 2% of its GDP -- would mean an additional $50 billion in demand for the goods and services of Japan's trading partners. America's share of this $50 billion might be in the $5 billion to $15 billion range, or about 100,000 to 300,000 jobs.</br></br>Can Japan do anything to reduce its current-account surplus? Luckily, yes. Increases in public spending and tax cuts can stimulate domestic demand, increase imports and reduce the trade imbalance without jeopardizing Japan's fiscal stability. Japan's own consumers and businesses, reeling from the effects of the worst economic slowdown since World War II, would be the major beneficiaries of more expansionary fiscal measures. But Japan's trading partners would share in the benefits. Fiscal expansion is a win-win strategy for Japan and the rest of the world -- and it was a major focus of the Framework talks.</br></br>Japan's current-account surplus is only one of the distinctive features of its international performance. Another is the comparatively small share of manufactured imports in total Japanese consumption. Over the past 20 years, the share of manufactured imports in total consumption has increased steadily and perceptibly in all of the advanced industrial countries, except one: Japan. Today this share is only about 6% in Japan, compared with more than 15% in the U.S. and Germany.</br></br>Japan also has a distinctively low level of intra-industry trade -- that is, trade in differentiated manufactures within a given industry. Japan does import -- but it tends not to import very much in industries in which it is a major exporter. Japan is a major exporter of automobiles, for example, but it imports very few of them. In contrast, the U.S. and the other advanced industrial countries that trade with one another tend to buy and sell in the same product lines, thereby reaping the benefits of enhanced product competition and lower prices for their consumers.
The Federal Reserve on Friday released 1,865 pages of transcripts of its behind-closed-doors policy meetings in 2008, the year of the worst financial crisis in generations. The Fed announced the outcome of the meetings right after they occurred, and it released minutes summarizing the discussions a few weeks later. But these documents reveal for the first time officials' verbatim remarks during the heat of many difficult moments that year. Among the insights they provide:</br></br>1. The Fed was often behind the curve</br></br>"A perception has developed that we are tentative and indecisive," then-Chairman Ben Bernanke warned his colleagues in January 2008. At times, he moved aggressively to cut short-term interest rates; at others, he held back. After Lehman Brothers collapsed, he thought monetary policy, with short-term interest rates at 2%, was in the right place. By year-end, he acknowledged the Fed was at a "historic juncture" and moved aggressively to unconventional policies to avert another depression.</br></br>2. Janet Yellen's forecasting record was mixed</br></br>The current Fed chairwoman said in March 2008 that history would probably show a recession had started in November 2007. That was a good call: The National Bureau of Economic Research put the date at December 2007. Ms. Yellen is highly regarded for her ability to read the economy, but she also makes mistakes. In June 2008, she guessed the Fed's next move would be interest-rate increases to fight inflation before year-end. Instead, the Fed continued cutting rates through the year.
PARIS -- The recent uproar over a Renault SA plant closing in Belgium may be only the beginning.</br></br>Thousands more jobs may have to be cut if such industries as autos, telecommunications and banking are to become as efficient in France and Germany as they are in the U.S. and Japan, according to an analysis of Europe's two largest economies.</br></br>The McKinsey & Co. review suggests that government regulations in France and Germany have slowed economic growth, increased unemployment and have often backfired -- failing to create even the social benefits regulators intended.</br></br>To an extent, the report states the obvious: High minimum wages, state regulations and stunted capital markets have retarded growth rates on both sides of the Rhine. The report also suggests that in some cases, worse things are yet to come.</br></br>The auto sector, it says, is suffering because French and German barriers on the number of Japanese cars imported into their domestic markets have delayed necessary restructuring.
In a closed hearing room on Capitol Hill yesterday afternoon, conferees from the Senate and House gathered to argue over an unresolved issue in the trade bill before them: Should foreigners who make large-scale investments in this country have to register and disclose data about themselves?</br></br>It was a question that, four or five years ago, none of them would have thought to ask-another sign of how sharp a corner the U.S. economy has turned in the 1980s. Through its history, the United States has generally kept its borders open to foreign investment money. Today, with funds from abroad cascading in with a force never before imagined-an estimated $800 billion since the beginning of 1983-some Americans are worried that the open door may lead in the end to loss of economic sovereignty.</br></br>Using dollars accumulated through years of trade surpluses with this country, foreigners are buying manufacturing companies, banks, hotels and office buildings. They are setting up new factories and sales chains. They are buying huge volumes of U.S. government securities that finance the federal budget deficit.</br></br>Much of this investment is due to the withering of American industry and the low value of the dollar. Beginning in 1985, the drive to force down the dollar was meant to stimulate sales of U.S. products abroad, but it has also meant that the companies and factories that make those products are that much cheaper to foreign buyers.</br></br>Almost every country in the world has mixed feelings about rich foreigners, and this one is proving no exception. In Congress and among the public, some people are wondering if the family jewels are being sold. Will national security be threatened by having crucial production controlled from abroad? Could the U.S. economy be held hostage to foreign interests?
BEIJING -- Economists and politicians from Brussels to Washington say that the Chinese yuan is undervalued. For China's own good and that of the global economy, they say, the currency needs to move up in a big way, and soon.</br></br>So why hasn't China revalued? Part of the answer is Japan.</br></br>The last time the U.S. was faced with a rising Asian export power, the currency also became a big political issue. And in September 1985 the major economies of the time met at the Plaza Hotel in New York to ease those tensions. The accord they reached caused the dollar to fall from roughly 240 Japanese yen to about 160 over two years.</br></br>Today, China's critics are demanding a similarly sweeping move. But Japan soon regretted agreeing to a big surge in the yen: Growth slowed abruptly, which pushed the government to boost spending and lower interest rates. A real-estate bubble and a years-long slump followed. And the issue the Plaza Accord was intended to fix -- Japan's sizable trade surplus -- remains to this day.</br></br>From Japan's example, Chinese thinkers learned that a big exchange-rate move could damage their economy, and won't necessarily help the trade balance.
The one-week-old rally broadened yesterday, as stocks posted their biggest gains since the beginning of the summer in very heavy trading.</br></br>Buoyed by the continued strength of the bond market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points to close at 1134.61. Trading soared beyond 127 million shares, the largest volume since Feb. 9. The increasing breadth of the rally also was indicated by a sharp jump in the ratio of gainers to losers. Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange topped losers by more than 4-to-1. On Tuesday, the ratio was only slightly above 1-to-1.</br></br>The transportation index was up 11.92 points while the utilities average rose 1.34 points.</br></br>The industrial average surged out of the gate at the opening bell, and the morning's news seemed to promise a strong push to the finish. Government figures showed declines in both factory orders and construction spending in June, offering further support to the market's hopes for a slowdown in economic growth leading to lower interest rates. In addition, the bond market displayed what many traders termed surprising strength, with long-term Treasury bonds jumping nearly a point in morning trading.</br></br>After the first half-hour, the industrial average was up more than seven points, and it continued to climb steadily until late afternoon. At that point, the average stumbled a bit, which was attributed to profittaking, then the rally resumed to the close.
WALKING SHOES are strong sellers, although the category is tough to define.</br></br>The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, North Palm Beach, Fla., says sales of walking shoes rose 1.3% in 1998, while overall sales of athletic footwear fell nearly 8%. The trade group adds that walking remains popular as a fitness activity. "But it's hard to say just what shoes people are buying to walk in," says Mike May, a spokesman for the group. Choices range from "white" athletic shoes to dressier "brown" specialty shoes. Retailers note that the sales trend, while not new, is accelerating, and manufacturers are adding fashion brands. Travelers who want a cozy, crossover shoe for trips are a factor, they say.</br></br>New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. in Boston reports a "huge surge" in walking-shoe sales in the first quarter -- up 55% from a year earlier. Adele Rubinstein, manager of a Footprints Footwear store in Royal Oaks, Mich., says sales are brisk at the shop, which specializes in brands such as Mephisto, Rockport and Birkenstock. In Seattle, Nordstrom says the chain has been building its walking-shoe stock since this past fall.</br></br>DKNY plans to introduce a Comfort line this fall that includes, among other features, "antibacterial linings."</br></br>A PEACHY CROP in Georgia spells good news for farmers there.
WASHINGTON -- China came under more pressure to let its currency rise as Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said flatly that the yuan is "undervalued . . . to promote a more export-oriented economy" and an International Monetary Fund study suggested that a currency move wouldn't harm Chinese growth if handled properly.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke, making his strongest comments on the subject in speaking before Congress's Joint Economic Committee, said, "It would be good for the Chinese to allow more flexibility in their exchange rate" to "address inflation and bubbles within their own economy" and to help bring more balance to a global economy in which China relies too much on exports and the U.S. too much on borrowing to import.</br></br>But Mr. Bernanke, responding to questions from China critic Sen. Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) also said that moving the exchange rate alone wouldn't have a major short-term effect on trade flows -- though "over time it would have an impact."</br></br>The Fed chairman's remarks come amid growing expectations that China will allow its currency to rise, perhaps before leaders of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing countries meet in Canada in June.</br></br>The U.S. Treasury recent postponed a decision on whether to label China a "currency manipulator," an apparent effort to give China some political breathing space to revalue its currency without appearing to bow to U.S. pressure.
David M. Kennedy, the next Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, yesterday prescribed a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½very tight" Federal budget as the cure for inflationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½a remedy that he concedes will produce ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½somewhat higher" unemployment in the Nation.</br></br>Kennedy, who will step down as board chairman Chicago's Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co. to join President-elect Nixonï¿½Ûªs Cabinet, appeared before the Senate Finance Committee</br></br>Inflation, he said, is the central problem of the economy and ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½I think it's very important that we have a very tight budget on the expenditure side.ï¿½Û ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The effort would be to take the inflationary steam out of the economy with a minimum of increase in unemployment,"</br></br>Kennedy said. But, yes, he added, unemployment would "surely be somewhat higher than the present rate."</br></br>How much higher is an impossible question at this point, the Secretary-designate said. "I don't like to get into percentages because youï¿½Ûªre dealing with human beings,ï¿½Û he said.
DETROIT -- The economy is so good in Michigan and Ohio that these two states, once symbols of the Rust Belt's struggles, are fighting across state lines to recruit workers and ease growing labor shortages.</br></br>Michigan, facing its lowest unemployment rate in almost 30 years, at 4.4%, is doing the once unimaginable. The state is spending $50,000 to advertise in national newspapers to attract people back to the place from which thousands fled in the early 1980s when unemployment skyrocketed past 15%. One private company alone says it has about 1,000 openings.</br></br>On behalf of hundreds of companies looking for skilled workers ranging from engineers and computer analysts to construction workers, the five-week campaign is essentially a huge help-wanted ad for the state. The ad, touted by Gov. John Engler's administration as proof of Michigan's economic comeback, comes complete with a list of fringe benefits, including affordable housing, 11,000 inland lakes and the nation's highest number of golf courses. Likely to be added soon: "Home of the Stanley Cup Champions," after Detroit's beloved Red Wings won the title Saturday night. (The ads are being placed only in cold-weather climates because Michigan officials doubt they are going to attract many workers from California or Florida to brave the state's winters.)</br></br>"These are $50,000-to-$100,000-a-year jobs that are going unfilled," says Jim Tobin, a spokesman for the Michigan Employment Security Agency. "A lot of people, particularly on the East Coast, don't appreciate the high quality of life here. We are asking people to pick up and move."</br></br>But the ads are running straight into a similar campaign by some cities in Ohio. Businesses in Ohio are touting job openings, symphony, and ballet in national magazines like BYTE, and are flooding the nation's job fairs with glossy brochures in a campaign already exceeding $20,000. One task force recently came to Detroit to try to lure workers south across the state line.
THE DOLLAR CONTINUED to fall against the yen, touching another record low despite intervention by the Bank of Japan during Asian trading. Traders and analysts are betting the drop is far from over. Meanwhile, economists said that the lower dollar won't quickly narrow the U.S. trade gap, but ultimately the deficit will shrink if the currency remains weak.</br></br>---</br></br>Mexico may be forced to raise interest rates well beyond their current levels of nearly 100% to stabilize the country's weakened currency, a central-bank official said. He said the stance is necessary to prove Mexico's commitment to stabilizing the peso.</br></br>Citicorp has suspended plans to expand its retail banking business in Mexico, citing the economic turmoil there following the peso's decline.</br></br>---
ONE OF THOSE fascinating changes in stance which can happen only in American politics took place in the Senate during the stock market gyrations.</br></br>Last week the Democrats turned around and pinned the identical label on their Republican brothers. A Republican attack touched off by the stock market tumble triggered their reaction. In speech after speech, Republicans had blamed New Frontier policies for the break, predicted melancholy days ahead.</br></br>The Democrats absorbed the punishment for awhile, then swung to the offensive. They painted a roseate picture of the Nationï¿½Ûªs basic economic strength, assured their colleagues that all would be well.</br></br>Assistant Senate Majority Whip Hubert H. Humphrey was making this sort of defense Tuesday afternoon. Across the aisle, Sen. Henry C. Dwor-shak (R-Idaho) arose to read a dolorous cable report of American stocks toppling abroad.</br></br>Humphrey asked him for the time line on his dispatch. Then, with an aide running bulletins from the ticker, he topped Dworshak with later news of the blue chip rally in Wall Street.
The Democratic majority of the Joint Economic Committee yesterday accused the administration of complacency over the prospect of continued unemployment rates above 5 per cent.</br></br>It said the administration should adopt an interim goal of reducing unemployment to 4 per cent before the end of 1973 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½or offer a clear explanation of why it is inappropriate.ï¿½Û	.</br></br>To reduce unemployment toj 4 per cent, the committee ma-j jority said, in a mid-year re-| view of the economy, the: United States would have to adopt policies designed to.</br></br>The Democrats denounced ! administration calls for a $250 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½billion spending ceiling, argu-|ing that ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½recovery must not .be choked off by premature I moves toward monetary and I fiscal restraint.ï¿½Û</br></br>I The Republican minority! on the committee, by contrast, extolled the ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½strengthï¿½Û jof the nationï¿½Ûªs economic performance over the past six 'to nine months.
At the end of a rough week for financial markets, the White House today threw its full weight behind efforts to get an economic stimulus package through Congress, even if the measure has yet to take its final shape.</br></br>Speaking at the White House late this morning, President Bush said passing a growth package was "our most pressing economic priority." Later, after traveling to a manufacturing plant in nearby Frederick, Md., Mr. Bush said, "We need to get this deal done and get it out." Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pitched in with an afternoon press conference, in which the former Goldman Sachs CEO appeared with Ed Lazear, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Referring to a stimulus package, he said, "If it's broad-based and simple, I believe we'll be able to get it out quickly, in time to make a real difference this year." Mr. Paulson said individual tax payers would receive the lion's share of the incentives in the package, which -- in its entirety -- would be in the ballpark of $140 billion and $150 billion, or roughly 1% of the country's gross domestic product. A Republican official, speaking to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity, said that Mr. Bush wanted about $100 billion to go to individuals and about $50 billion channeled toward companies.</br></br>In order to get it done, Mr. Bush and the Republican minority in Congress will have to sit down and hash out a deal with representatives from the Democratic majority. But, amid signs that country's economic engine is beginning to sputter, there seems to broad bipartisan support to get a bill done. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, (D., Calif.) has said she hopes to have a bill enacted within a month. And in a prepared statement in response to Mr. Bush's comments today, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) said, "I am encouraged and share the president's view that we need prompt bipartisan action to strengthen our economy. I also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively."</br></br>---</br></br>Stock Decline Again
Officials Press</br></br>Japan on Rates</br></br>International Monetary Fund officials said Japan's central bank should keep the pace of interest-rate increases "gradual," and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development urged it not to raise rates until the end of 2008 to ensure an end to deflation. The OECD predicted Japan's real gross domestic product would rise 2.4% this year, higher than the 2% growth it had forecast. In 2008, the OECD said, the economy would expand by 2.1%.</br></br>Smoking Banned</br></br>In 75% of Homes
Wall Street was growing worried in November 2002 that the Federal Reserve might not be able to keep the economy from tumbling into another downturn.</br></br>Economic growth was sluggish, just a year after a recession and terrorist attacks. And inflation was falling unusually low, even though the Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate was at its lowest level in more than four decades. The Fed couldn't lower the rate much more, and soon might have no power to spur a more vibrant expansion, many analysts speculated.</br></br>Wrong, said Ben S. Bernanke, a former Princeton economics professor who had joined the Fed board just four months earlier.</br></br>Bernanke, in a speech, reassured the markets that the Fed still had several weapons to stimulate the economy and had "most definitely not run out of ammunition." Bernanke also suggested that the Fed had beaten inflation, its arch-enemy since the 1970s, and had shifted its focus to a new danger -- deflation, the crippling decline in overall prices that plagued the United States during the 1930s and Japan in the 1990s.</br></br>To listeners in financial markets, Bernanke's words marked a turning point for the Fed and heralded the arrival at the central bank of a new voice and strategist to help guide the economy through a dicey time.
In the early 1990s, as a decade of prosperity gave way to tighter budgets and revenue shortfalls, Arlington officials reacted like well-honed athletes caught off guard by a mild touch of the flu.</br></br>The economy might be under the weather, they acknowledged, but the prospects of a swift and total recovery were excellent. As one of the region's most prosperous jurisdictions, Arlington was well positioned to ride out the recession, they said.</br></br>But with the county entering a fifth consecutive budget season facing a large revenue shortfall, that brand of optimism has begun to wane. Increasingly, county officials are acknowledging that they face a long-term case of the fiscal blahs, in which annual increases in the property tax rate and mild program cuts will continue to be the rule.</br></br>"There is going to be no great recovery from the recession, which we've been counting on for several years," said Mark Jinks, the county's director of management and finance. "There's a recognition on the board's part that things have to get in line."</br></br>On Saturday, Arlington County Board members received a continuing run of gloomy fiscal news that began in 1990, after a regional real estate boom came to an abrupt halt. After hearing that land values would continue to stagnate, the board approved a budget guideline of $432.1 million for the 1996 general fund budget - leaving a projected $15.7 million shortfall.
Smoothing the way for President Hu Jintao's upcoming visit to the United States, a 200-strong team of Chinese officials and entrepreneurs has embarked on a tour of U.S. cities to sign deals that they say will bring companies there up to $15 billion in new business.</br></br>Their first purchases, computer software and hardware worth $4.44 billion, were signed Thursday in Los Angeles, according to the Commerce Ministry. The deals to be signed also include grain, telecommunications equipment and Boeing aircraft, a senior Foreign Ministry official said. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Jianchao, described the total to be contracted only as "a large amount." But Zhou Xianmei, a spokesman for the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles, said the scheduled purchases amount to $15 billion.</br></br>The contracts are being signed in part to demonstrate to U.S. businessmen and their representatives in Congress that trade with China can be profitable for the United States even though it resulted in a record $202 billion deficit in 2005. The imbalance, mainly due to flourishing Chinese exports of low-price goods, has generated resentment in Congress and led some Senate and House figures to urge that trade restrictions be imposed.</br></br>The senior official said Hu plans to meet with members of Congress in addition to President Bush and administration officials, seeking to calm growing anxiety among legislators over the trade deficit, China's swift economic growth and its increasing influence in Asia.</br></br>The bunching of the business deals being signed in coming days, the official acknowledged, was designed to sweeten the atmosphere for those talks in Washington on April 20.
ANNAPOLIS, March 2ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The : House Appropriations Committee ,,!pï¿½gan systematically slicing into ;$pv. Harry Hughesï¿½Ûª $6.4 billion budget today as part of a strategy to avoid the politically painful step of increasing taxes on property, ciga-hrettes and alcoholic beverages, as the rgovernor had proposed.</br></br>'il Speaker Benjamin L. Cardin said the cutsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½about $24 million expected iri' voting sessions today and Thursdayï¿½ï¿½ï¿½are legitimate reductions that will not harm services, and will doom the need for Hughesï¿½Ûª tax initiatives.

The chief business of the American people is business, Calvin Coolidge famously said seven decades ago. If Silent Cal were around today, he might conclude that Bill Clinton's chief business as president has been the politics of business.</br></br>From imposing trade sanctions on China to helping Mexico out of its financial jam, from fighting the budget deficit in his early presidential days of economic recovery to presenting his new, mildly reflationary budget, the president has steered a steady course of placating American business interests and seeking the financial markets' authenticating approval.</br></br>No surprise there. Clinton's concern with holding the strong support he got from the business community in 1992 and steadying the markets has long been evident. But David Alan Munro writes from Laguna Beach, Calif., to put the administration's quest for approval from Wall Street in a broader, more speculative perspective.</br></br>"There will always be a main non-governmental entity -- for example, the Church prior to the Reformation -- from which government seeks approval or legitimacy," writes Munro, a retired history professor. "That entity has been finance-capital for a long, long time."</br></br>Today Munro believes that the "authenticating mechanism" for government and politicians is shifting from financial markets to the media, which Clinton alternately courts and assails. Caught on the cusp of this transformation and not sure which way to turn, the Clintonites "are in for a rough ride" in 1996, the professor notes with sympathy.
With the Palestinian Authority on the verge of collapse, the United States is coming under growing pressure to revive the deadlocked Middle East peace process -- or face the prospect that its partners will begin looking for alternatives, according to European and U.N. diplomats.</br></br>The United Nations, the European Union and Russia, the other three parties in the diplomatic quartet that sponsors the "road map" for peace launched by President Bush in June, now fear that 2004 will be a lost year in the peace process because of the U.S. presidential election, the officials said.</br></br>Charging that the road map is "completely paralyzed" and the quartet held "hostage" by a moribund process, a senior European diplomat said yesterday that frustrated U.S. allies are interested in looking at other options, including the unofficial Geneva accord outlined by former Israeli and Palestinian negotiators.</br></br>"We're so frustrated with the constant delays," said the European diplomat. "We don't accept putting the idea in the fridge for months. . . . If the United States says it does not want to do anything, then maybe we should organize an alternative."</br></br>In the vacuum, the Bush administration's partners in the peace process are also warning that U.S. inaction would strengthen Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's hand and allow Israel to unilaterally create a de facto Palestinian entity on about 40 percent of the West Bank and Gaza.
WHAT WORRIES some Washington experts about the stock market is that certain basic factors which led to the 1929 crash are present today. Prior to the 1929 crash, the United States had pumped several billion dollars into Western Europe in the form of bond issues and bank credits, which in turn financed U. S. exports. These exports were not actually paid for by Europe but by the American investors who purchased foreign bonds. It was largely a synthetic form of foreign trade.</br></br>And when the financial world began to question this inflated system of foreign trade, the whole structure came tumbling down in the 1929 crash. Calvin Coolidge, who presided over the post-wrar period of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½normalcy,ï¿½Û periodically bolstered the stock market with expressions of presidential confidence. But in 1929, as Herbert Hoover entered the White House, it could be bolstered no longer.</br></br>Likewise today the United States has been financing exports through foreign aid. This time not the banks and the bond houses have put up the money, but rather the American taxpayers through the United States Government. But the effect has been the same. U. S. exports abroad have been synthetic. They are not paid for by for-</br></br>Meanwhile, European factories have become modernized and efficient. American labor has helped to price U. S. goods out of the market. The whole structure of foreign trade is in real danger of being deflated. And just as Coolidge presided over post-World War I nor-maly, President Eisenhower for eight years issued complacent statements about post-World War n prosperity.</br></br>. John F. Kennedy entered the White House at a postwar II period corresponding .to that of Hoover, after eight years of complacency plus eight years of inflated exports. ï¿½Û¢
The passage of President Clinton's budget plan inspires one overriding emotion: relief. The biggest casualty of this dreary debate, conducted with hype on both sides, has been public understanding. The whole process has perpetuated the myth that the budget serves mainly as a tool to manage the economy. Our debates are backward. They focus on the budget's immediate economic effects and ignore the broader issue: defining the scope of government - and finding the best ways of paying for it.</br></br>The budget package is better than nothing, because it makes a small start at controlling the government's mushrooming debt. But you should be skeptical of all claims, pro and con, concerning the instant economic impact. Ours is a $6 trillion economy. Modest changes in government spending or taxes - and these changes are modest - don't mechanically determine its behavior. Too many other things matter. Remember that the deficit reduction of $496 billion occurs over five years, when the economy's estimated output will total slightly more than $36 trillion.</br></br>The point is not that the budget has no economic consequences; it is that the important consequences tend to be gradual and cumulative, as opposed to sudden jolts that make (or break) the business cycle. Yet, the politics of the budget are just the opposite. It will be judged on whether the recovery continues and how strong it becomes. Clinton and the congressional Republicans have each staked their political futures on something over which they have little, if any, control.</br></br>Clinton calls the budget "my plan for economic recovery" and says that it has already reduced interest rates on mortgages and bonds. Well, maybe there's been a small effect. But the main reason rates have dropped is the decline of inflation that began long before Clinton's election. Investors accept lower interest rates, because the value of their money isn't eroding so rapidly. It's the Republicans, though, who really ought to worry. Recoveries, once begun, gather momentum. If this one does, gradually creating new jobs with low inflation, Clinton will boast, "My plan worked - and not one Republican voted for it."</br></br>What will they say then? Republicans seem to expect that the recovery will stumble on what Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole calls "the largest tax increase in world history." Dole must have amnesia. In 1982, when he was majority leader, Congress passed legislation raising taxes $214 billion over five years. Adjusted for inflation, that's larger than the five-year tax increase in Clinton's budget ($240 billion). Guess what? The economy didn't collapse. By 1987 it had created nearly 13 million new jobs.
The Federal Trade Commission yesterday charged Georgeï¿½Ûªs Radio and Television Co., a major Washington area appliance retailer, with failing to give consumers required information about the warranties on products.</br></br>The complaint was the first issued by the FTC under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, which established federal standards for warranties on consumer products. The FTCï¿½Ûªs rules outlining what manufacturers and retailers must tell consumers about the terms of warranties on appliances and other consumer products costing more than $15 went into effect on Jan. 1, 1977.</br></br>The law, and the regulations implementing it, require that warranties be disclosed completely, labeled either ï¿½Û¢ï¿½Û¢full" or ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½limitedï¿½Û and be available for the consumer to read and compare before buying. ï¿½Û¢ ï¿½Û¢	By giving consumers, what it calls "Georgeï¿½Ûªs extended limited warranty,ï¿½Û violates the requirement that a warranty be designated exclusively limited or full. A full warranty requires that a defective product be repaired or replaced within a given time.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢	Failed to clearly and conspicuously disclose what parts or components of the products are covered by or excluded from each warranty offered, and when the warranty time period begins.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢	Failed to make manufacturersï¿½Ûª and its own warranties available prior to sale. It may have set up binders containing the information, but failed to give consumers ready access to them, the FTC complaint charged.
The number of people claiming new jobless benefits dropped last week, but the still-elevated level reflects a continued weakness in the U.S. labor market.</br></br>Separately, U.S. labor costs rose last spring even more than first thought as worker productivity fell, threatening to hurt corporate profits and job growth amid the economy's fight to recover.</br></br>Initial jobless claims fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 409,000 in the week ended Aug. 27, the Labor Department said Thursday. Claims filed in the previous week were revised to 421,000 from an originally reported 417,000.</br></br>Economists had forecast claims would drop by less than they did. A Dow Jones Newswires survey put the expected decline at 7,000. However, the level remains too high: economists generally think the economy is adding more jobs than it is shedding when claims drop below 400,000.</br></br>The four-week moving average of new claims, a more reliable indicator of the labor market's recent performance because it smooths out volatile weekly data, rose by 1,750 to 410,250.
The House voted yesterday to let President Eisenhower raise interest rates on Government savings bonds but denied his companion request for authority to boost returns on long-range marketable securities.</br></br>for passage of the legislation, which Is designed to spur lagging bond sales and relieve some of the financial pinch on the Federal Treasury.</br></br>The measure now goes to the Senate where approval Is almost certain. It would permit the President to Ignore the legal interest ceiling on Series G and H savings bonds purchased by millions of Americans through banks or payroll withholding.</br></br>The bill, which would be retroactive to June 1ï¿½ï¿½_ would apply to future bond purchases as well as to the $42 billion worth of savings bonds now held by an estimated 40 million Americans.</br></br>The President wanted the authority to pay higher Interest on savings bonds. But he also Insisted that Congress should let him raise interest rates on long-term marketable bonds purchased mainly by large investors such as banks and insurance companies.
The Catholic bishops are being praised ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and also getting it in the neckï¿½ï¿½ï¿½as they meet to discuss their latest draft of a pastoral letter in which they declare the moral imperative of ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½the rejection of nuclear war.ï¿½Û</br></br>For two years now, they have heard and read every argument for and against the use of nuclear weapons and have gone through two drafts of a proposed pastoral letter, the latest titled, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Challenge of Peace: Godï¿½Ûªs Promise and Our Response.ï¿½Û</br></br>Assorted cold warriors, peaceniks and techsniffs, who donï¿½Ûªt know much about Catholicism, and the run of editorialists have been considerably agitated by the notion that a gang of bishops is going to sway some 51 million American Roman Catholics to an ordained point of view of war and peace.</br></br>The bishops have already been charged with getting ready to challenge the Reagan administrationï¿½Ûªs strategy of nuclear deterrence and retaliation and putting Catholic servicemen on the spot with conscience-raising questions about the morality of nuclear war.</br></br>Well, bishops everywhere have a duty to teach their flocks, and thatï¿½Ûªs what the 300 American bishops are doing. But they cannot dictate to the consciences of Catholics. They can only hope that a pastoral letter on any subject will cause Catholics to think.
"It seems that Fortune 500 executives are poor students of history. Have they ever heard liberte, egalite, fraternite? They must be begging for guillotine."</br></br>"Leave the CEOs alone!! They work hard to get where they are, they deserve the high salaries. They work long hours, are away from home many nights, travel a lot. Put up with a lot of unhappy, unskilled and unappreciative people."</br></br>"No raise for us little guys for three years and the management all got bonuses and 15% raises.

It's time for an `Economic Injustice' tax. Since it is the shareholders [that] reward CEOs for layoffs, I think the remedy is to tax shareholders a flat fee (per share) every time a company lays off a certain percentage of its labor force. There should also be levies for outsourcing, and moving jobs offshore."</br></br>"I noticed you didn't mention what any of the mucky-mucks at the AFL-CIO pay themselves."
I don't know how many dozen conventional State of the Union speeches it took before I made my basic discovery about the applause that everyone monitors so earnestly during these annual events, reaching conclusions as to party reaction, committee chairman's attitude, chances of passage and so forth. It was that this applause in fact had practically nothing to do with any such considerations, but was a function of something else: The members rose and roared, disrupted the speech with prolonged applause and otherwise loudly indicated their approval precisely and almost exclusively for those pronouncements that they knew to be untrue.</br></br>Indeed, the more patently untrue, the lustier and more protracted the cheer. The fundamental proposition was always the same: that we could have it all - a stronger defense and more investment in domestic programs, environmental purity and accelerated energy development, lower taxes and increased benefits, etc. We will do this, but not at the expense of that ... the speaker would intone, his voice rising to indicate deep conviction for the wholly implausible second part of the sentence. And the place would go nuts.</br></br>You do not have to buy all of Bill Clinton's program or to check your view that there was too much of some things, not enough of others, to acknowledge that his Feb. 17 address for the most part crashed through this tradition of mutual dissembling between presidential speaker and congressional audience. Yes, there were some muzzy, unpersuasive moments. But in the main Clinton was saying not that we could have it all, but that we couldn't and that we now had to choose how to get out of the economic predicament that had been talked about mostly by indirection or even covertly in Washington for years.</br></br>Over those years, the dialogue on the question of the budget deficit and its effect had become ever more tortured, demeaning and involuted - embarrassingly so, I would have thought, for grown men and women. We at The Washington Post, starting back in the early Reagan years, would occasionally be visited ("off the record") by prominent Republican legislators and others urging us editorially to help bring about some bipartisan deal wherein big shots of both parties would just sort of close their eyes, hold hands and jump off the cliff together, always with careful provisions to keep one of the parties from cheating and being left standing there on the ledge while the other - poor fool - plummeted into the political abyss. They would talk about ways to frame the thing so that Reagan more or less wouldn't notice or at least wouldn't have the wit to object. They discussed him as if he were the mad uncle in the attic who, unfortunately, still had title to the house.</br></br>It was unbelievable, now that I think of it, but at the time it seemed only mildly strange. That is because Washington had pretty thoroughly bought into the proposition that some of the things Bill Clinton was to say the other night simply could not be said, not even argued about - too dangerous. People outside this city who complain about the waste of taxpayers' money should, if they want to get even madder, merely contemplate how much they paid out in both executive and legislative branch salaries over the decades to people who gave over hours and days and weeks of paid time to fussing about who would or wouldn't get the blame for saying aloud what they were all whispering among themselves.
The widely tracked Nasdaq Composite Index froze for nearly an hour Tuesday after Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. experienced problems transmitting data for stock-market indexes, the latest in a series of technical problems besetting Nasdaq.</br></br>Exchange officials blamed Tuesday's index outage on "a human error" rather than a computer glitch. Traders said the impact to the broader market was minimal, despite trading halts for some options contracts linked to the indexes.</br></br>The episode, however, deepened questions around the stability of critical market systems after a succession of failures in data feeds - including two other breakdowns in Nasdaq-operated systems - repeatedly knocked out trading over the last two months.</br></br>"One time is a random event, the second time it may be a coincidence and the third time is proof of weakness," said Ophir Gottlieb, managing director with LiveVol Inc., which analyzes options markets. "It appears Nasdaq has some serious issues with their technology and they may be unable to consistently deliver market data over a long period of time."</br></br>The Securities and Exchange Commission has been in contact with "market participants" and is monitoring developments around Tuesday's issue, which is standard practice for the regulator, an SEC spokesman said.
Wall Street finished an uninspired session mixed on Monday as a new high in oil prices was partly offset by a better-than-expected reading of the nation's industrial activity and strong sales at Wal- Mart Stores.</br></br>The stock market remained resilient in the face of record intraday and closing prices for oil. A barrel of light crude reached an intraday high of $62.30 before closing at $61.57, up $1, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The death of Saudi King Fahd was cited as creating uncertainty in the oil market.</br></br>The surge in oil prices was mitigated by upbeat July sales at Wal- Mart and a bullish reading of the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index -- showing that both the consumer and industrial sectors have adapted well to high energy costs. However, the strong growth in the economy raised concerns about the Federal Reserve and its policy of gradually raising the nation's benchmark rate.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 17.76, or 0.2 percent, to 10,623.15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.17, or 0.1 percent, to 1235.35, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 10.55, or 0.5 percent, to 2195.38.</br></br>Wal-Mart rose 18 cents, to $49.53, as the retailer reported a 4.4 percent increase in sales from stores open at least a year, another strong sign of consumer spending.
Dow Jones Newswires</br></br>The backlog of initiaI public offerings waiting to be priced is smaller than a year ago, an indicator of a worsening environment for bringing companies public.</br></br>About 114 companies are waiting to go public, based on filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, down from 160 at the same time last year, according to data tracker Dealogic. The deals are estimated to be worth $20.9 billion, down from a waiting list worth $29.1 billion a year ago. Last week, just seven companies filed IPO paperwork with the SEC.</br></br>Much of the slowdown has to do with the broader stock market, which has been in the red almost the entire time this year. Some is because companies need more time to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires detailed summaries of internal controls and auditor opinions on those controls.</br></br>And some is due to the rotten performance that some recent IPOs have put in, such as metal-products distributor Earle M. Jorgensen Co., which hasn't revisited its offering price of $10 a share since the moment it began trading.
Consumer prices edged up a slight 0.2 percent in May, as the government issued its third report in a week showing an unexpectedly low inflation rate coupled with surprisingly robust economic growth.</br></br>White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the consumer price report, along with earlier reports on the wholesale prices and the gross national product, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½makes it the Triple Crown of low inflation.ï¿½Û</br></br>Speakes said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½This monthï¿½Ûªs economic news shows the economy is creating jobs without creating inflation. Economic growth is strong, but moderating to a sustainable level. The CPI [consumer price index] confirms our course of sustainable growth with low inflation.ï¿½Û</br></br>The Labor Department reported yesterday that the May,CPI rose 0.2 percent, as food prices recorded their sharpest drop in nearly a year while housing costs rose only modestly. The consumer price index has risen</br></br>The consumer price index for the Washington area also rose 0.2 percent for the two months ended in May, the Labor Department reported. Area prices rose 4.3 percent for the 12 months ended in May. [Details on Page D8.]
The stock market, jolted 'back, into motion by American Telephone & Telegraphï¿½Ûªs dividend increase, piled up a big gain today in trading that broke the volume record set last month.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 15.67 to 975.76 in its best daily showing in three weeks. At the close the average stood just short of the 27-month high of 976.62 on Feb. 4.</br></br>Big Board volume surged to 39.21 million shares from 29.99 million Wednesday, to surpass the previous peak of 38.51 million established on Jan. 30.</br></br>Turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including activity in those stocks on other markets around the country, totaled 45.16 million shares.</br></br>During the day, volume for the new year passed the 1 billion-share mark on the New York exchange. Last year, when volume set an annual record of 4.7 billion shares, it did not reach 1 billion until March 10.
Arthur John Keeffe, 86, a professor emeritus at Catholic University law school who worked on several committees on Capitol Hill and contributed frequently to professional journals, died of congestive heart failure Oct. 2 at Georgetown University Hospital.</br></br>While serving as counsel to Rep. Wright Patman (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, Mr. Keeffe wrote a widely noted history of the Federal Reserve System. In 1955, he served as counsel to a Senate subcommittee under Sen. Estes Kefauver (D-Tenn.) that investigated the Dixon-Yates scandal, an issue in the 1954 congressional elections. It involved conflicts of interest in the award of a contract to build a power plant at West Memphis, Ark., that would have fed into the Tennessee Valley Authority system.</br></br>Mr. Keeffe also was counsel to a Senate committee that investigated campaign financing in the 1952 presidential election. In the aftermath of World War II, he was president of a board that reviewed all general courts-martial in the naval service.</br></br>From 1952 to 1983, Mr. Keeffe wrote a regular column reviewing current legal literature for the American Bar Association Journal, and he contributed to numerous other legal publications.</br></br>A resident of Washington since joining the law faculty at Catholic University in 1955, Mr. Keeffe was born in Elmira, N.Y. He received undergraduate and law degrees from Cornell University. He practiced law in New York City and then taught law at Cornell. Except for World War II, when he again practiced in New York City, he remained at Cornell until he moved to Washington.
BROOKLYN PARK, Minn. -- Wilsons the Leather Experts Inc. expects to report a net loss of 21 cents to 23 cents a share for its fiscal first quarter, wider than the most recent Thomson Financial/First Call analysts' consensus estimate of a loss of 12 cents a share.</br></br>The specialty retailer of leather outerwear, apparel and accessories said first-quarter sales rose 30% to $117.5 million from $90.3 million a year earlier, but same-store sales rose only 2.1%, compared with a 7.2% increase for the same period a year before. For last year's fiscal first quarter ended April 29, Wilsons posted a loss of $1.38 million, or eight cents a share. Excluding items, the company's year-ago loss was five cents a share.</br></br>The retailer also expects to report a loss for its fiscal second quarter of $1.01 to $1.03 per share, which is in line with the $1.01-a-share loss expected by analysts. Wilsons said it expects sales of $106 million to $109 million for the second quarter.</br></br>For the full fiscal year ending in January, Wilsons said it expects to earn $2.75 to $2.85 a share on sales of $842 million to $852 million. The most recent consensus estimate had seen the company reporting profit of $2.94 a share for the full year.</br></br>Joel Waller, chairman and chief executive, said the wider-than-expected fiscal first-quarter loss estimate is due to the decision to accelerate the closing of four stores, lower comparable-store sales in April because of the timing of Easter and the performance of its newly acquired Bentley's Luggage Corp. unit.

The first week of the fall TV season brought grim news to network executives hoping for a swift recovery from last year's audience- zapping writers' strike.</br></br>Many viewers haven't rushed back to their television sets to watch this year's highly promoted season premieres, preferring to catch the shows on digital video recording devices and online -- or not catch them at all.</br></br>An average of 9 million people tuned in to prime-time programs on the top five English-language broadcast networks the night they aired last week, a 4.3 percent decline from the first week of the 2007 TV season, according to Nielsen Media Research.</br></br>General Electric's NBC faced the steepest overall declines, with 16.3 percent fewer viewers. Older-skewing CBS, a unit of CBS Corp., was down 9.6 percent among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49. News Corporation's Fox and The CW, a joint venture between CBS Corp. and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros., were both up over last year, but still ranked Nos. 4 and 5 in viewers among the English-language networks, respectively.</br></br>Network executives blame an array of factors for the low ratings, including the increased penetration of DVRs; the availability of broadcast network shows online; the fragmentation of the TV audience; and high interest in the presidential election and the economic crisis, which is drawing viewers away from prime-time programming toward news channels and the Internet.
American Greetings Corp. unveiled a "productivity initiative" that the company said will exact a heavy toll on near-term revenue and earnings. The news sent shares of the nation's second-largest greeting-card concern down 32%.</br></br>In heavy composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American Greetings plunged $11.1875 to $23.875 after falling earlier to a new 52-week low of $23.25.</br></br>The strategy, the company said, is aimed at fattening future profits by allowing American Greetings to equal or better existing retail sales with less inventory. The plan is designed to let the company better exploit recent investments in technology that have shortened the time required to design, produce and ship a new generation of cards. Consumers' tastes in greeting cards are "changing faster than they have in the past," an American Greetings spokesman said.</br></br>But the first phase of the company's plan, which calls for a "sell-through" that will reduce permanently the number of American Greetings cards on retailer's shelves, will slice about $100 million from revenue for the fiscal year beginning Monday.</br></br>In essence, American Greetings will for a time replenish its existing cards on retailers' shelves at a rate lower than full replacement. Once that temporary process has lowered the retail-card inventory to the company's reduced target level, officials expect sales will continue at their current pace, or even strengthen.
As we write, the money is even on whether the Fed's Open Market Committee will choose to push up the Fed funds rate at its meeting tomorrow, or perhaps after the election in November. With unemployment at a seven-year low of 5.1%, the Street's priests are warning that higher inflation is around the corner unless the economy makes the autumnal sacrifice of a pre-emptive rate hike.</br></br>Such thinking of course has long traditions among central bankers. Back in the 1960s, William McChesney Martin Jr. used to describe the Fed's job as that of the sourpuss who removes the punchbowl just as the party gets going. The Fed chairman himself practiced what he described: Faced with inflation of a whopping 1.5%, Martin led the Fed's board in hiking the discount rate a steep 150-basis points over 18 months during the spending build-up for Vietnam. Given that inflation is now closer than it has been in decades to the levels of Martin's tenure, it's hard to think of a good reason for tightening money except for taking away the punchbowl.</br></br>Of course, it's also currently faddish to talk of minimum unemployment levels, or to drop the unlovely acronym of NAIRU -- the "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment." But the notion of some kind of grand trade off between inflation and a slowdown flies in the face of the experience of recent decades. We learned, or should have, that it is possible to at once suffer both evils (the stagflation of the 1970s), or neither (the relatively low inflation, high growth 1980s).</br></br>The signs we like to look at show a picture of growth pushing forward absent inflation. The Dow Jones Spot Commodity Index, which seeks to measure the pressures in the commodities markets, stands at 146 vs. 151 a year ago. Stripped of volatile oil and food prices, most commodities measures are down from a year ago. Brian Wesbury of the Chicago bond firm Griffin, Kubik notes that the Fed funds rate is still higher than overall economic growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product, a sign that the central bank is not stimulating the economy.</br></br>The dollar is gaining against the mark, yen and the currencies of other important trading partners such as Canada. As for gold, after punching across the $400 border this spring -- the monthly average for February was $404 -- it is now bumping around at $382. The dollar is buying more gold than it was nine months back, a sign that there is scarcely a need to "wring inflation" from the greenback.
ATLANTA -- HBO & Co., preparing to be acquired by McKesson Corp., said one of its top executives, Jay P. Gilbertson, resigned "to pursue other opportunities."</br></br>Shares of HBO, a supplier of software to the health-care industry, fell sharply on the news. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday, HBO closed at $22.875, down $2.3125. McKesson, a drug wholesaler based in San Francisco, agreed last month to acquire HBO in a stock swap currently valued at about $11.5 billion. In New York Stock Exchange Friday composite trading, McKesson closed at $70.375, down $1.3125.</br></br>At HBO, Mr. Gilbertson served as co-president, co-chief operating officer and chief financial officer. McKesson and HBO had said he would play an important role in the combined company as a member of a new operating committee of eight executives, a McKesson spokesman said. But he said Richard H. Hawkins, McKesson's current chief financial officer, would retain that role in the new company, to be called McKesson HBOC.</br></br>Mr. Gilbertson couldn't be reached for comment. The McKesson spokesman said the two companies wanted to retain Mr. Gilbertson, but added: "His departure should not have a significant impact on our business." HBO said Albert J. Bergonzi, also a co-president, would assume Mr. Gilbertson's duties.</br></br>Ben Rooks, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, said the stock market seemed to be overreacting to Mr. Gilbertson's departure. "I'm not surprised he's leaving," Mr. Rooks said. "I'm a little surprised by the timing." But Anthony Vendetti, an analyst at Gruntal & Co., said the resignation raised questions about "who's going to be minding the store at HBO."

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said yesterday that the U.S. economy is "going through a soft patch," but that it won't hold back a "broadening" economic expansion that has gained momentum this year.</br></br>High energy prices in recent months have both boosted inflation and sapped consumers' spending power, Greenspan told members of the Senate Banking Committee at a semiannual hearing on Fed policies.</br></br>But the recent flare-up in inflation should prove temporary, Greenspan said, adding that the Fed still expects to raise short- term interest rates only gradually in coming months.</br></br>"Those higher prices, by eroding households' disposable income, have accounted for at least some of the observed softness in consumer spending of late, a softness which should prove short- lived," Greenspan said.</br></br>Despite such problems, he said, "economic developments in the United States have generally been quite favorable" this year. "Not only has economic activity quickened, but the expansion has become more broad-based and has produced notable gains in employment," he said.
Trip Hawkins, the charismatic chairman of 3DO Co., may be forced to dig deep into his own pockets to help keep his video-game player afloat for the next year, as a key partner and several game suppliers appear to be backing away.</br></br>3DO is trying to break into the major leagues as the video-game industry, ruled by Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Nintendo Co., shifts to a more powerful breed of game machines. Some big names are backing 3DO's ambition, including Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Time Warner Inc. and AT&T Corp. The company says it has recruited 550 outside game developers and pressed over one million copies of 50 titles on compact disks that hold computer data. It also asserts it got off to a "strong start" in Japan, selling 80,000 machines in the first two months.</br></br>But despite a blizzard of publicity generated in part by Mr. Hawkins's marketing skills, the company has been hampered by surprisingly slow initial sales in the U.S. where demanding kid consumers say the games don't offer enough pizazz for the $500 price. Only 40,000 units of its game player, sold under Matsushita's Panasonic label, have been sold since October despite a price cut from an original $700. "Everyone has been shocked at the lower sales," says a person close to the company. Now, after posting a $51.4 million loss for the fiscal year ended March 31, 3DO has about two quarters of cash left amid mounting expenses, such as a national advertising campaign and a shift to in-house game development.</br></br>Mr. Hawkins, who is also chairman of video-game publisher Electronic Arts Inc., has sold nearly $15 million in Electronic Arts stock since November. A person familiar with his plans says he intends to put $10 million into 3DO and raise $10 million from GoldStar Co., a Korean conglomerate, and an additional $10 million from current partners in a private placement of stock by the end of June. The company had attempted to raise money through a secondary offering last December, but its sagging stock price thwarted the plan. Having peaked at $47 in October, the stock closed unchanged at $15.50 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.</br></br>"I enjoy putting my money where my mouth is," Mr. Hawkins says, but declines to discuss specific plans for his money or identify any next-round investors. As for 3DO's cash squeeze, he says, "It's a moot point . . . There is plenty of money that wants to be invested in the company."
WASHINGTON -- Wage and benefit costs remained contained in the last quarter, good news for inflation watchers.</br></br>Meanwhile, a jump in unemployment claims in California could portend weakness in the country's largest state.</br></br>The employment-cost index for the fourth quarter of 2000 rose 0.8% on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department said. That was down from a 0.9% increase in the third quarter and below consensus expectations of a 1.1% rise. It marked the third-straight deceleration in the ECI, a broad survey of labor costs that measures wages and benefits, since it jumped 1.4% in the first quarter of 2000.</br></br>Overall, Americans' wages and benefits grew by 4.1% for the year, the biggest increase since a 4.3% rise in 1991. Inflation rose more slowly, meaning workers saw real gains in compensation relative to the cost of living.</br></br>As long as employment costs remain low enough to keep inflation pressures down, say many economists, the message to Federal Reserve policy makers is clear. "Despite the tight labor market, I think the Fed has a lot of flexibility in their deliberations on how to cut rates," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh.
This is a critical moment for U.S. manufacturing. Of course it is fraught with risk and controversy -- but also rich with possibility. Unfortunately, the latter usually goes unnoticed by our policymakers. Many of them believe that U.S. companies can no longer compete on their own. They want to isolate America by erecting trade and investment barriers. They seem not to have a clue that we live in a global economy.</br></br>This parochialism hurts American companies, and hence it hurts America; it also hurts the rest of the world, denying the benefits our industry can bestow. The new protectionism, then, is a "lose-lose- lose" proposition. It is unsustainable: U.S. companies cannot collectively operate as a single-engine plane trying to pull the rest of the world along with us. We need multiple engines for growth, and the rest of the world provides them.</br></br>Here, Caterpillar's experience may be instructive, and perhaps lead to some larger lessons for U.S. business leaders in the global economy. We're in the midst of one of the most successful periods in our 81-year history, coming off our second year of record sales and profits. Our workforce has grown more than 20%, and our stock price has more than tripled in five years. To be sure, we've run up against the same labor costs and global competition as the auto makers and other troubled manufacturers. But we're doing fine. Why?</br></br>There's no single answer. We've addressed rising health-care costs proactively; we invested substantially to improve productivity and get flexible with our sourcing; we eliminated our centralized, functional structure and established independent businesses with specific profit- and-loss responsibilities. Throughout, we kept our focus on designing high-quality, innovative products. But most importantly, we're thriving today not because we survived globalism but because we embraced it.</br></br>Caterpillar is one of America's major manufacturers; last year alone we exported more than $9 billion in products. But we've also become a major British manufacturer, a major Brazilian manufacturer and a major Chinese manufacturer -- just to name three of the 40 countries where we have a presence. By expanding globally, we have maintained our ability to grow. We refused to concede markets to competitors and thus kept them from gaining undue strength to block our entry. When it made sense to invest for local access, we did so.
The recent turmoil on Wall Street reflects the simple fact that interest rates are rising rather than falling for the first time in nearly a decade, forcing speculators and investors to recalibrate the assumptions on</br></br>But the consensus among economists is that the rise in rates will not choke off the current expansion because1 the economy is strong enough to overcome it.</br></br>"IkTear term, these higher interest rates and market gyrations are scary for everyone,ï¿½Û said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Lehman Brothers Inc. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But in point of fact, the amount of damage to the economy should not be great.ï¿½Û</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The rate of growth in the economy is determined by a number of factors, including incomes, exports, jobs,ï¿½Û said Gordon Richards, chief economist of the National Association of Manufacturers. "And right now those factors are providing the econo-, my with enough momentum." This calm in the face of rising rates may seem somewhat at odds with recent economic history. Last year, after all, falling interest rates were widely credited with getting the economy out of low gear. Wouldnï¿½Ûªt a rise in rates now have the opposite effect?</br></br>Not exactly, say economists. How much a rise in interest rates will hurt the economy depends in large part on what is causing it. And in this case, the cause is likely to be benign.
Corrections & Amplifications</br></br>THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE asks that issuers wanting to list on the exchange have three years of profits, which add up to at least $6.5 million in total. A Deals & Deal Makers article yesterday incorrectly said the exchange asks for market capitalizations of that amount. The required market cap for companies that are joining the exchange from other markets is $100 million. (WSJ Feb. 14, 2001)</br></br>The stock of E*Trade Group Inc. goes to its new home this week, and its former stock-market landlord is still steaming.</br></br>As announced last month, shares of the Menlo Park, Calif., online brokerage firm will leave the Nasdaq Stock Market on Thursday and start trading on the rival New York Stock Exchange. Many companies have left Nasdaq for the NYSE over the years, of course, but this defection is particularly sensitive -- and not just because it's the first one of 2001 or because E*Trade has been a Nasdaq stalwart since its initial public offering of stock in 1996.</br></br>Why does it grate on Nasdaq? Officials at the electronic marketplace say they're still irked at how E*Trade chose to break the news to them.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the announcement you have been waiting for. I am-are you ready?-forming a committee to study the possibility that I may, someday and somehow, run for . . . er, president. I am contemplating the formation of such a committee for the following reasons:</br></br>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the announcement you have been waiting for. I am-are you ready?-forming a committee to study the possibility that I may, someday and somehow, run for . . . er, president. I am contemplating the formation of such a committee for the following reasons: 1) I am better qualified for the White House than some of the people running; 2) I need a place to live in downtown Washington that has a pool; and 3) I have an absolutely unbeatable platform that has nothing to do with trade, foreign policy, raising or lowering taxes or taking a position on such issues as surrogate motherhood, about which I change my mind almost daily. Instead, I simply propose that all of us-the rich and the poor, Republican and Democrat, Christian and Jew, of whatever sexual orientation-be given a single account number for all our credit cards and other bills. I would make this a law.</br></br>Under the Cohen administration (merely to write those words gives me a thrill), no one would ever again have to study a bill with Talmudic intensity (and often in poor light) to find an account number to write in the lower left-hand corner of a check. There would be no account number, such as the one I have with a bank that was silly enough to grant me credit, that has-count them-seven zeroes in the middle of the number and that, every month, I have to count out to write on the check. I am afraid, as I should be, that if I am wrong by one zero, my payment will wind up in Ollie North's Swiss account and go to underwrite a dinner for Los Freedom Fighters in a Miami restaurant.</br></br>The Cohen administration would see to it that each and every bill payer has the same account number for American Express, Visa, Choice, MasterCard, Exxon and even the gas company. Moreover, it would be against the law for any company to add a prefix to your account number, leaving you unsure of just what your real account number is and unaware that you have made a mistake until you try to write the number in the little boxes on the envelope and see that there are too few boxes for the number that is already on the check sealed inside.</br></br>Moreover, the Cohen administration would insist that all checks be made out to the name of the company on the credit card. Thus, checks to Visa would be made out to "Visa" and not, as is the case, "UV Bak," whatever the hell that is. As it is now, I have to pause before writing out every check to see what fool name the company has come up with. Usually, the information is found in very tiny print somewhere in a maze of disclosures, indecipherable interest rates and notices that you have exceeded your credit limit. Visa would be Visa, and that would be it. In addition, any bill from a group health practice would have to state in capital letters who the check should be made out to (Feinblum, Smith, Golden, Arrowsmith & Newman simply will not fit on a check).
Wall Street ended an uneasy session mostly lower and bond prices tumbled Wednesday after the Federal Reserve suggested it might not be through raising interest rates if more increases are needed to fight inflation caused by soaring energy and commodities prices.</br></br>The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.88, or 0.02 percent, to 11,642.65. The Dow is less than 80 points from its highest-ever close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 2.29, or 0.2 percent, to 1322.85, and the Nasdaq composite index sank 17.51, or 0.7 percent, to 2320.74.</br></br>The Fed's decision to boost a key short-term lending rate to 5 percent was widely anticipated. But investors were rattled by the central bank's accompanying statement, which said more policy firming -- or rate increases -- could be necessary to contain inflation.</br></br>Bonds sold off their earlier gains after the Fed's statement. And the chance for more interest rate increases weighed on the dollar, which fell against the Japanese yen. Meanwhile, gold futures climbed past a 25-year high of $700 an ounce.</br></br>Crude oil futures rebounded Wednesday as worries about overseas supply cutoffs countered a weekly government report showing increased oil and gasoline reserves and greater refinery output.
WASHINGTON -- The House approved a $282.6 billion measure to fund the nation's defense in the coming fiscal year.</br></br>The bill, which passed on a 360-53 vote, would fund all Pentagon operations for the year beginning Oct. 1 except military construction projects, civil defense and nuclear warheads, which are covered by other legislation. A defense-spending bill is pending in the Senate.</br></br>The measure moved through the House with uncommon harmony, as lawmakers avoided fights over arms-control provisions that have embroiled defense-spending bills in previous years. This year, that battle is being waged in the Pentagon authorization bill, which is currently being considered by a House-Senate conference committee. Authorizing legislation defines which programs the government may carry out and sets spending ceilings for those programs, while appropriating legislation funds the programs.</br></br>The House spending bill represents a 1.4% decrease in defense spending from current levels, after inflation is taken into account. The legislation would give the Pentagon $556.6 million less than the Reagan administration had requested and make changes in spending priorities.</br></br>Research into the president's Strategic Defense Initiative, for instance, would be funded at $3.2 billion under the bill, $400 million less than current spending and $1.3 billion less than the administration request. National Security Adviser Colin Powell has said he would advise Mr. Reagan to veto any bill that makes "crippling" cuts to the program.
President Clinton, in a wide-ranging defense of his economic policy, urged the nation today to continue shrinking the federal debt and seeking new trade opportunities to keep the economy strong.</br></br>In what the White House billed as a "major economic speech," the president rejected criticisms of his fiscal strategy--which has largely focused on deficit reduction--from the political left and right. Noting that some liberals want him to spend more heavily on social issues and some conservatives want deeper tax cuts, Clinton said, "You can't forget what got you here."</br></br>Clinton said the government also must continue to encourage the growth of information technologies and to close the "digital divide" that keeps many from sharing the benefits of computerization and the Internet. And he renewed his call for China's membership in the World Trade Organization, which some labor and environmental groups oppose.</br></br>The federal debt reduction that has occurred under his watch "set in motion a virtuous cycle" that lowered interest rates and made it easier for businesses to expand and for families to pay off loans for cars, houses and college educations, Clinton told an audience at the University of Pennsylvania. His 44-minute address was the first in an annual lecture series founded by entrepreneur and Clinton political supporter Michael Granoff.</br></br>The president said he will convene "a major White House conference" on the economy on April 5. It will include several economists, corporate executives and others to "focus on the most cutting-edge issues facing the new economy," an administration briefing paper said.

Both parties have good arguments that their opponent has helped outsource jobs, but both sides have also exaggerated their evidence in a way that misleads voters.
Wall Street pared an earlier advance to end mixed Tuesday as investors' persistent concerns about interest rates and the economy countered relief over an upbeat home-building report.</br></br>At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 32.73, or 0.3 percent, to 10,974.84, after rising almost 88 points earlier. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.02, to 1240.12, and the Nasdaq composite index lost 3.36, or 0.2 percent, to 2107.06.</br></br>A stronger-than-expected jump in new-home construction fed optimism that the overall economy remains sturdy in the face of higher lending rates and gasoline prices. However, disappointing forecasts for June business sent home builders' shares down.</br></br>Upbeat sales from Caterpillar and steady oil prices also gave stocks support. But while the market recovered somewhat from Monday's decline, erratic trading like Tuesday's is anticipated while investors await the Federal Reserve's latest statement on inflation and economic growth after its meeting next week.</br></br>Bonds slipped, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note edging up to 5.15 percent, from 5.14 percent late Monday. But the two-year yield was 5.20 percent, signaling less confidence in long-term debt with expectations of an economic slowdown.
NEW YORK, Jan. 28ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Stock and bond prices soared today and shortterm interest rates fell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned in its best one-day performance in 10 months.</br></br>Analysts said the broad rallies in all three marketsï¿½ï¿½ï¿½stocks, bonds and short-terim- securitiesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½had more to do with the internal functioning of those markets than with the administrationï¿½Ûªs economic programs or the increase in leading economic indicators announced this morning by the Commerce Department.</br></br>The Dow Jones Average of 30 industrial stocks jumped 21.59 points to 864.25, the biggest single-day increase for that key stock market indicator since last March 12, when the Dow index rose 22.15.</br></br>66.8	million shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange. That was a sharp rise from the 50.1 million shares bought and sold Wednesday and the heaviest trading day since last March 13.</br></br>There was an ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½explosive rallyï¿½Û in short-term interest rates, according to Nicholas Marrone of the Bank of New York. Three-month Treasury bills fell 60 basis points (each basis point is l/l00th of a percentage
The mutual-fund boom is slowing down for the first time in six years.</br></br>Investors who poured $523 billion into stock and bond funds in 1991-93, when interest rates were falling, have pulled back now that rates are rising. In the first nine months of this year, net new investments plunged 53%, according to the Investment Company Institute.</br></br>Bond funds have taken the big hit. Stung by losses and lured by rising interest rates on much-safer money-market funds and bank certificates of deposit, investors pulled $26.8 billion out of bond funds in the March-September period.</br></br>Stock funds are still drawing in new money, net of outflows, but the rate of inflow is down more than 6% since March, after the Federal Reserve began jacking up interest rates to keep the lid on inflation. Some analysts warn that a sharper reversal could hit those funds, too, if the stock market takes a major drop.</br></br>The mutual-fund slowdown is bearish for the markets because it is weakening a major prop under stock and bond prices. By one estimate, more money went into stock mutual funds in the 1992-93 period than in the previous 52 years. And for Wall Street, it's a bearish threat to securities firms' already-declining profits.
Best Check</br></br>On Inflation:</br></br>Broken Banks</br></br>With the Fed training a monetary fire hose on the financial system, many in currency and other markets are getting itchy about inflation. But without an effective fix for the banking sector, they are likely getting ahead of themselves.</br></br>Inflation may be a monetary phenomenon, to paraphrase Milton Friedman, but money is only inflationary if it gets spent quickly. Right now, it isn't getting spent very quickly at all.
The economy grew at a faster rate than originally estimated in the first three months of this year as the nationï¿½Ûªs output of goods and services topped its pre-recession peak, the government said yesterday.</br></br>The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 8.5 per cent during the quarter, up from an April estimate of 7.5 per cent.</br></br>The revision pushed the GNP, as measured in inflation-adjusted 1972 dollars, to $1,241,2 billion at an annual rale, surpassing the $1,240.9 billion peak in the third quarter of 1973.</br></br>At the White House, press secretary Ron Nessen said, ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½The Presidentï¿½Ûªs econmists feel this revision is consistent with other upward trends and other upward revisions." the December projections" and perhaps even faster than estimates made at the end of the first quarter.</br></br>The quarterï¿½Ûªs increase was the biggest since a surge at an annual rate of 12 per cent during the early stages of economic recovery in the third quarter of 1975. It means economic growth for 1976 is likely to exceed original estimates.
Enthusiasm about a new treatment for sexual impotence drove the shares of Pfizer Inc. to an all-time high in brisk trading yesterday. At day's end, it ranked as the top U.S. drug company in stock market value, passing Merck & Co.</br></br>Analysts variously estimated that doctors are writing 15,000 to 40,000 new prescriptions a day for Viagra, Pfizer's $10-a-dose pill against impotence. Even if the lower number is correct, Viagra could turn out to be one of the most successful product launches in pharmaceutical history.</br></br>Viagra was licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on March 27, and has been on pharmacy shelves in most parts of the country for about a week. Most previous treatments involved creams, implants or injections. Urologists and other doctors who treat impotence say that men who have never talked about their problem are coming out of the woodwork to demand the pill.</br></br>"They're calling in on a daily basis," said Harold Bondy, an Arlington urologist who has already written about 20 prescriptions. "They basically have heard about the tablet and they want to try it."</br></br>Positive news about Viagra's sales drove Pfizer's stock price to a record $113.75 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, though by the close the stock had fallen a bit, to $113.37 1/2. That was a jump of nearly 8 percent from Friday's close.
Two days after U.S. officials decided to let Lehman Brothers collapse in September 2008, and just before the Federal Reserve unleashed a torrent of programs to bolster the financial system, central-bank officials were still struggling to grasp the magnitude of the calamity that had hit the economy.</br></br>"I think that our policy is looking actually pretty good," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said of the level of interest rates at a closed-door Fed policy meeting on Sept. 16, 2008, according to transcripts of its policy meetings that were released Friday after the traditional five-year lag.</br></br>Officials decided at the meeting to hold interest rates steady at 2%. It was one of Mr. Bernanke's last moments of passivity in the financial crisis.</br></br>As he spoke, the Fed was moving ahead with plans to help bail out American International Group Inc., the large failing insurer seen as crucial to the financial system. Within days Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would go to Congress and make an urgent plea for a bank-bailout plan. By year-end, the Fed chairman had pushed a still-hesitant central bank toward an unprecedented experiment with easy-money policies aimed at reviving the economy.</br></br>The Fed transcripts, 1,865 pages documenting one of the most turbulent economic times in the nation's history, covered eight formal and six emergency policy meetings the central bank conducted in 2008. They provide the most complete view yet into developments inside the nation's central bank as the financial crisis worsened and threatened to plunge the U.S. into another Great Depression.
Senate Republicans yesterday blocked consideration of a bill designed to prop up the struggling housing industry, declaring that the Democratic-backed provisions would harm mortgage lenders and inflame the housing crisis.</br></br>With a 48 to 46 vote, the Senate did not gain the 60 votes needed to halt a threatened filibuster on the housing package. The vote capped a week of parliamentary gridlock in the Senate, which spent nearly three days mired in an Iraq war debate without casting a substantive vote on the underlying bill mandating troop withdrawal.</br></br>Democrats, stymied in their effort to curb President Bush's Iraq policies, had hoped to begin debate on the housing bill to address the public's anxiety over the economy, which has supplanted the war in recent polls as the issue of greatest concern.</br></br>The housing proposal includes billions of dollars for local communities to buy up subprime mortgages and a controversial rewrite of bankruptcy laws to allow judges to slash interest rates for low-income homeowners. The mortgage industry has waged a stiff lobbying campaign against the bankruptcy provision.</br></br>Democrats mocked Bush's statements at yesterday's news conference, where he urged giving the $168 billion stimulus package approved this month a "chance to kick in first." "That, to me, is straight out of the Herbert Hoover playbook," Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters, adding that his bankruptcy measure would save family homes. "Right now, there will be a question on the floor of the Senate as to whether the mortgage bankers are going to win or the American families facing foreclosure are going to win."
Author: Andrew J. Johnson</br></br>NEW YORK--A hawkish tone from European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet at the central bank's policy meeting this coming week could push the euro toward $1.40, analysts expect, but the impact of Middle East upheaval on currencies remains a wild card.</br></br>The dollar will likely remain under pressure as market participants mull whether the U.S. Federal Reserve could extend its quantitative-easing measures, after some weaker-than-expected U.S. growth data. The Federal Reserve is also likely to keep interest rates low for an extended period, a view that may be underscored by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's testimony for lawmakers scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.</br></br>The end of the week brings the all-important monthly U.S. employment report.</br></br>St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard, a nonvoting Fed member this year, said Thursday that a third Fed bond-buying effort isn't off the table, given tensions in the Middle East and rising oil prices as well as ongoing concerns about the financial health of some euro-zone governments, all of which could weigh on global economic growth.
pOR the past six weeks in-A vestors and investment analysts have been visibly expressing in the stock market their disappointment with the current rate of corporate earnings. Simultaneously, the business analyst is making ms own analysis of the economie effects of these earnings.</br></br>While the earnings statement of most companies for the second quarterly period are yet to be published, the pattern revealed so far justifies a significant generalization. In most instances the rate of sales for the second quarter was not bad, reflecting the fact that the broad measurements of business activity were close to the highest on record. Gross National Product for the second quarter, at an annual rate of $505 billion, was slightly higher than the first period of the year and was a little more than 3 per cent higher than a year earlier. The FRB Index of Industrial Production was only a shade lower than the high record rate of the first quarter and was about the same as the second quarter of</br></br>HOWEVER. EVEN though many companies are recording modest year-to-year increases in sales, they are turning in lower profits. There is an evident inability to recover higher costs by raising prices. We have here a very significant that ample supplies and ample</br></br>The interpretation of this condition by investors was reflected in the stock market last week by the fact that some of the choicest blue-chip issues recorded new low prices for the year and, in some instances, for last year too. The New York Times stock price average dropped to the lowest point since the autumn of 1958. As this article is being written on Friday, the Dow Jones industrial stock price average had not yet penetrated the significant low points recorded in March and May, although they were heading in that direction.</br></br>In brief, investment managers are beginning to express their skepticism about the justification for price/earnings ratios which are still historically high, if we are going to be operating over the intermediate term in an economy that shows distinct signs of becoming more competitive than any time in the entire postwar period.
One of the enduring mysteries of the personal computer age is why studies continue to show no appreciable increase in personal productivity from the increasingly powerful machines on nearly everybodyï¿½Ûªs desk. Hereï¿½Ûªs a heretical theory: part of the trouble is Microsoft Windows.</br></br>Thatï¿½Ûªs right. The very software designed to make computers more accessible and easier to learn and use in fact detracts from getting work done. And the reason is thereï¿½Ûªs far too much choice and flexibility in configuring the software to the userï¿½Ûªs persona) taste.</br></br>What makes Windows potentially helpful to workers is that it presents an easy way to operate a computer, and a common set of menus and commands that appear not only in Windows itself, but in the application software designed to work with Windows. So far, so good.</br></br>But once you learn your way around Windows, you discover you can, with just a few clicks of your mouse, make all kinds of changes.</br></br>You can, for example, change the color scheme, the icons used to represent programs, the size of the windows and their location. The list goes on. Perhaps the biggest waster of timeï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and moneyï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is the vast selection of "screen savers" on the market.
Target-date funds drew a lot of criticism during the bear market for big losses. Whether or not the criticism was deserved, one thing is clear: Average investors need to better understand the risks and benefits of these popular retirement-savings vehicles.</br></br>Designed as hands-off, long-term holdings, target-date funds typically contain a retirement year in their names and shift to a more conservative asset mix as that year approaches. But as the market tanked in late 2008 and even supposedly conservative funds for people retiring in 2010 took a hit, questions arose about how well people really grasp these products.</br></br>Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro has asked her staff to prepare rule recommendations about how target-date funds are marketed, and the Labor Department's Employee Benefits Security Administration plans to require fund providers to give plan participants more information about target-date funds when they are among the default options in retirement-savings programs such as 401(k)s.</br></br>Target-date funds rebounded strongly along with the broad stock market last year. Funds geared to retirement in years between 2000 and 2010, for example, returned an average 22.4% last year after falling an average 22.5% in 2008, according to researcher Morningstar Inc.; this year, they're down a slight 0.7%. The rebound since 2008 "takes some of the immediate pressure off these funds, but there's still a lot of questions out there," says Laura Lutton, editorial director in the mutual-funds research group at Morningstar.</br></br>Here are five questions investors should ask:
Last month the Wall Street Journal accused me of advocating subsidies for food-based ethanol. I ought to "take a vow of embarrassed silence," it said, for claiming that ethanol's contribution to the food crisis is "overblown." The Journal's claims would be laughable if the stakes were not so high.</br></br>Cellulosic biofuels offer a chance to have an environmentally meaningful impact on petroleum use while benefiting farmers, entrepreneurs and consumers. I have many investments in biofuels companies. Some say I believe in biofuels because I have invested in them. The truth is that I invest in biofuels because I believe they can help our environment, economy and national security.</br></br>Just as the word "drug" can refer to aspirin or cocaine, "biofuel" refers to a variety of products that vary dramatically in their environmental impact and effects on food prices. For instance, biodiesel from food oils such as soybean or palm oil has traditionally created environmental negatives. But corn ethanol has been a stepping stone to cellulosic ethanol, a preferred alternative that is likely to achieve unsubsidized market competitiveness with oil within a few years.</br></br>We face an energy crisis, an environmental crisis and a terrorism crisis all related to oil. High-cost options to reduce consumption, such as hybrid and electric cars, sound good but are unlikely to materially reduce carbon emissions. To have a meaningful impact, at least half of the next billion cars manufactured on this planet must be low-carbon. The only cost-effective option (measured in cost per ton of carbon emissions avoided or grams of carbon emissions per mile driven) likely to achieve broad market acceptance in the next 20 years is cellulosic-fuel cars.</br></br>Unfortunately, biofuels are the target of interested parties' paid campaigns. The Grocery Manufacturers Association, for example, is waging a multimillion-dollar campaign against ethanol; the American Petroleum Institute is more concerned about food prices than oil prices. Slogans about how much corn and water are required to produce a gallon of ethanol are repeated frequently. In fact, a 16-ounce steak takes about the same amount of corn and more water. Should we ban steaks, too? Similarly, hybrid cars are hyped, but we seldom hear that they reduce carbon emissions about as much as corn ethanol, and at a cost that is substantially higher than flex-fuel cars.
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. -- Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wasn't expecting he would have to make another speech like the one he will deliver here Friday.</br></br>A few months ago, the Fed seemed to be on cruise control as the economy healed. Many officials at the central bank hoped they were done with launching complicated programs to spur a sluggish economy. But Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, once again disappointed by slow growth and small employment gains this year, are formulating another dose of monetary stimulus to be considered at their next policy meeting in mid-September.</br></br>So when the chairman speaks Friday morning at the central bank's annual retreat here, he must once again address whether there is more the Fed can do to get the economy going and whether it is worth taking chances on controversial new programs. All along he has argued these efforts are worth it and appears likely to stick to that line in his speech.</br></br>Beyond big issues of the moment -- such as whether the Fed will launch a new bond-buying program -- a broader question looms in Jackson Hole about Mr. Bernanke's legacy. Long after his term as chairman ends in 17 months, will he be remembered as the Fed chief who did too little to combat high unemployment or the one who did too much and unleashed inflation and financial instability with the actions he took? Critics make both arguments.</br></br>How Mr. Bernanke acts now depends in part on which he sees as the stronger critique. As an academic before joining the Fed, Mr. Bernanke often criticized central bankers for dealing too passively with financial crises and economic malaise. As Fed chief, he has confronted many limitations to the policies he controls.

SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Firefighter Brian Endicott got an early taste of the pension battle brewing here when a man at the grocery store angrily pointed to the steaks in his cart.</br></br>"Who do you think you are, wasting taxpayers' money on a meal like this?" the man yelled at 46-year-old Mr. Endicott, who was shopping for dinner with three other firefighters from San Jose Fire Station No. 1.</br></br>After the 2001 terrorist attacks, sympathetic residents of this affluent city gathered at the firehouse to offer flowers, cakes and pies. Today, public sentiment toward the men and women in uniform has widely shifted, as many locals are up in arms over escalating pension costs for public-safety workers.</br></br>In the current fiscal year ending June 30, San Jose's retirement obligations soared to $245 million, up from $73 million a decade ago, according to the city. For police officers and firefighters who have retired since 2007, the average pension is $95,336, making them among the most generously compensated in the state.</br></br>Since the recession, dozens of state legislatures and city councils across the U.S. have scaled back benefits and jobs in an attempt to plug gaping budget holes. Safety workers like police and firefighters -- who generally earn more than librarians and garbage haulers -- have often been spared from some of the most drastic cuts.
WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department acknowledged that its tally of jobs in the U.S. exceeds the total estimates made by the 50 states, raising the possibility that the federal government is overstating the economy's strength.</br></br>Labor Department officials said it is too soon to tell which tally is more accurate.</br></br>In March, the two estimates of nonfarm payroll employment were nearly the same. But since then, the two sets of figures have diverged. In September, the national tally was roughly 400,000 larger than the sum of state estimates -- before taking into account seasonal adjustments -- according to Labor Department figures.</br></br>Earlier this year, the Labor Department lowered its estimate of the total number of jobs in the economy a seasonally adjusted 658,000, or 0.6%, because of a similar gap between the national and state data. The revisions made the recession look worse than it had previously.</br></br>William G. Barron, the deputy commissioner of labor statistics, are likely to address the issue in testimony today before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, Labor Department officials said. But it will be several months before the department's experts will know for sure if a large revision of the federal statistics are necessary.
The greatest barrier to solving our economic problems is the inability of government leaders to understand the difference between a World War II demand-pall inflation and the current 1974 cost-push inflation-recession. In the current environment, requests to cut spending and increase saving are partly responsible for our present economic crisis.</br></br>Perhaps the most notable example of demand-pull Inflation occurred after World War II. The end of the war found people with the desire and the money to buy all the things they had to do without for five years such as automobiles, refrigerators, appliances, houses and other durable and nondurable goods. This post-war spending spree injected a great amount of money into the economy in a relatively short period of time. Consumers were bidding against each other for scarce goods, which forced up prices, causing inflation.</br></br>was less than 4 per cent, and increased consumer buying pressures were forcing up prices and inflation. Govern ment actions to cool off the economy could include higher rates to discourage credit purchases: less government spending to reduce demand for goods: provision of tax breaks for industry to encourage plant expansion: and pressure on consumers to spend less and save more.</br></br>Essentially, these actions repreent the basis for the Ford administration's light against the present inflation-recession crisis.</br></br>But the rash of price increases we are now experiencing for consumer products is not caused by excessive consumer demand. It is the direct result of sudden huge price increases for energy and other basic commodities.
DUISBURG, Germany -- In Germany's much-vaunted stock exchange known as the Neuer Markt, Sudhir Bhatia is the king of would-be takeovers.</br></br>Since the beginning of the year, he has jolted three companies' stocks higher by announcing bids to buy them. He faxes out his plans to, he says, 600 media organizations, earning himself prominent attention as a serious player in the newly minted stock market.</br></br>But look a little closer and Mr. Bhatia's ventures appear quixotic. His company, Microboss Software AG, is tiny, with sales of $1.3 million last year. His takeover announcements often resemble rambling dissertations. He has misspelled his company's name (as Micorboss) and compared himself to a misunderstood genius. None of the announced bids have been consummated.</br></br>Welcome to the other side of the Neuer Markt, the centerpiece of Germany's effort to build a U.S.-style stock culture.</br></br>During the past four years, the Neuer Markt has brought 349 companies public, spurring hopes that Europe had a budding rival to America's Nasdaq Stock Market. But slumping stock prices have laid bare the exchange's flaws. More than half of its biggest companies lost money last year. Smaller companies are filing for insolvency at a record pace. The shares of about 10% of the companies listed now trade for pennies apiece, making the exchange a haven for speculators and market manipulators, critics say.

A concise summary of his reflections on monetary policy and related problems is contained in the following draft of his notes prepared for a final press conference held last week, and reproduced here with ids permission.) 1)	What can I say after 7 years on The Fed except that it was a great and 1 think creative experience. One question frequently asked is: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Mas there been any unexpected or basic change in how economy operates in past 7 years?ï¿½Û I donï¿½Ûªt think so. In 1955, I wrote a book on analyzing economy and forecasting. I think model contained in that would cover almost all liiat iias happened. There would be some important changes in emphasis and details, but off-hand 1 can think of no major change in concepts, theories or even approach.</br></br>(a)	There has been no major financial crisis. No major financial institutions	failedï¿½ï¿½ï¿½although	speculation probably was as great as in past periods when they did. Expansion of national output was longer and greater than in any prior expansion. Depth of recession smallerï¿½ï¿½ï¿½and it was planned. The basic knowledge means we can avoid major depressions. In 1966 and 1970, there were questions as to</br></br>whether Fed could avoid a ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½crunchï¿½Û by performing as lender of last resort. T assumed Fed would be sensible and it was. Note though this limits tightness of monetary policy compared to what some would advocate. (b)	On the other hand, better knowledge and communication probably means increased basic instability in private sector and particularly in financial markets. Expectations (or speculation) spread faster. People react more rapidly and strongly in the spheres of prices, wages, investments. This raises major problems for policy change.</br></br>(c)	We want to operate within that zone of the trade-off curve of output and pricesï¿½ï¿½ï¿½where required policy moves go beyond bounds of our information or knowledge. We cannot fine tune to extent wc would like because we are operating within random variance of data and knowledge.
Consumer confidence: It is one of 11 crystal balls the federal government uses to divine the future of the nation's economy.</br></br>There's just one problem. Many economists say "consumer confidence" is largely a bust as a forecasting tool.</br></br>Some even argue that confidence indices, based on national surveys of public attitudes on personal finances and spending plans, are a better measure of where the economy has been, rather than a reliable predictor of where it is going.</br></br>Still, one of those measures of consumer attitudes produced monthly by the University of Michigan, is enshrined in the bean-counter's hall of fame, namely: as one of the Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators.</br></br>Some prominent economists say consumer confidence should not be one of the government's certified indicators of future economic performance.
If President Clinton gets his way, next year's tax season could bring a bit of relief to middle-class families coping with crushing college bills.</br></br>But the proposed $1,500 tax credit for parents of college freshmen and sophomores would be contingent on grades: Students would have to have a B-minus average to be eligible. And that provision is stirring surprising concern in higher-education circles.</br></br>"I suspect it would be the end of any effort to control grade inflation," says Thomas Bickel, registrar of Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H.</br></br>Though tying financial aid to academic achievement is hardly new, colleges are accustomed to setting their own rules. Most insist that scholarship students remain "in good standing," and that means different things on different campuses. If the Clinton plan is approved by Congress, it could pressure professors to raise grades in certain circumstances, administrators fear. And if so, it would further muddy what has already become a very muddy situation.</br></br>Hardly anyone disputes that overall grades have drifted up since the 1960s. In a national survey of college students, Arthur Levine, now president of Teachers College at Columbia University, found that 26% reported better than A-minus averages in 1993, compared with 7% in 1969. Averages of C or below fell to 9% from 25%. Undergraduate grades have become so suspect that graduate schools now give more weight to applicants' standardized-test scores and personal recommendations.
The U.S. deficit in transactions with the rest of the world hit a record $41.1 billion in the second quarter, up sharply from $36.8 billion in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.</br></br>For the first half of the year, the deficit in the so-called current account, which includes trade in goods, investment income and other services, government and private remittances, tourism and military transfers, reached $77.9 billion, up from $61.5 billion in the same period a year ago.</br></br>Most of the widening of the current account deficit since last year was the result of a bigger gap between imports and exports of goods, a gap that also reached a record, $39.5 billion, in the second quarter.</br></br>But the long-standing U.S. surplus in services trade fell sharply in the second quarter. After averaging about $5 billion a quarter in 1986 and the first quarter of this year, the surplus in services dwindled to $1.3 billion, according to the seasonally adjusted but preliminary figures released yesterday.</br></br>The numbers can vary substantially from quarter to quarter and reconciliation of all of the trade and other flows into and out of the United States often leaves a large statistical discrepancy. However, analysts expressed concern about the new evidence that the United States is importing, in one form or another, ever more than it is exporting.
The crisis is about interests, not ideals. It has purpose but lacks passion. It inspires uneasiness in the stock market but only modest moral outrage.</br></br>President Bush has implicitly compared Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to Adolf Hitler, a simile that has caught the national ear. But the enemy also threatens Middle Eastern oil, a resource so important that the United States is willing to fight to protect it.</br></br>Hut for those who fought the last American war, this confrontation with Iraq in the Persian Gulf is likely to resolve itself into a "If itï¿½Ûªs for a genuine national-security reason, then we should be there," said Bill Gay of Marlinton, W.Va. "But you donï¿½Ûªt want to see the politicians mess everything up. The thing that bothered me most about Vietnam was that we fought so long and poured so many billion dollars down the drain, and we got nothing from it. If you fight, you want to fight to win."</br></br>Gay was one of many Americans who spoke about the crisis late Inst week with Washington Post reporters and special correspondents who interviewed people from Alaska and Texas, from Min-See MOOD, A31, Col 1</br></br>Prospective recruits have shown littlo fresh interest In tho Midoast, said Staff SkI.

THE FACT that the Federal Reserve Board is intent on still another interest rate boost is bringing President Johnson face - to - face again with the historic question of whether he or the hanking industry shall determine maior economic policy.</br></br>This will be one of the many uncomfortable issues to be tossed at Secretary of the Treasury Henry H. (Joe) Fowler when he appears before the Senate Finance Committee Friday. One Democratic Senatorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Eugene McCarthy of Minnesotaï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ plans to frame the issue in the form of a touchy question.</br></br>Does the President need standby economic powers, including statutory authority to over-rule the Federal Reserve Board, which serves as Americaï¿½Ûªs central bank and has always been dominated by commercial bankers?</br></br>The Administration is seeking no such power and would prefer not to have the question asked. Yet, the question of the FEDï¿½Ûªs cherished ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½independenceï¿½Û from the Executive Branch is once again critical as a result of the inflation scare spawned by the Vietnam war.</br></br>THE INTEREST rate boost decreed by the FED three months ago in defiance of Mr. Johnson has failed completely as an anti-inflationary device, just as critics predicted. Instead, it started a chain reaction in interest rate boosts. And though orthodox bankers deny it, this increase in the cost of money has been as inflationary as an increase in the cost of steel.
WASHINGTON -- Ross Perot said he would "absolutely not" raise taxes as president unless "there's some kind of incredible emergency." But he only added confusion as to how he would slash the nation's $400 billion budget deficit by cutting spending.</br></br>In an unusual two-hour call-in program on NBC "Today," Mr. Perot, who in the past has compared the nation's $400 billion budget deficit to "arterial bleeding," cited war as the sort of emergency that might lead him to raise taxes. But he provided virtually no specifics as to how he would cut spending, and he even backed away from earlier suggestions that he could save $20 billion a year by cutting Social Security benefits paid to the affluent.</br></br>In his interview, Mr. Perot offered a vision of a populist presidency, saying that he would stop at red lights when traveling by car, that he would spend most of his time outside of Washington and that he would not accept any salary. "Ross thinks he and his family are already financially secure," Morton Myerson, a top adviser to the Perot campaign, explained later.</br></br>While reinforcing his position as an "outsider," Mr. Perot's comments raised more questions than they answered. For instance, when asked by a caller about the fate of American dairy farmers, Mr. Perot said the problem is that the dairy farmer, "because he's small in numbers, is not properly represented" in Washington, while other special interest groups have political action committees and "people wandering the halls of Congress."</br></br>In fact, dairy interests have proven themselves one of the most powerful lobbying forces in Washington, using that force to prop the price of milk above market levels. The National Milk Producers Federation has a 16-person staff in the nation's capital, and their work is amplified by lobbyists for a half-dozen dairy cooperatives. During the 1989-1990 election cycle, the Associated Milk Producers Inc., a cooperative based in San Antonio, Texas, led all farm and agribusiness political action committees, with $769,800 in contributions to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance newsletter PACs & Lobbies.
Do bonds and REITs march to their own beats?</br></br>That question was the crux of "Urban Legend: The Myth of REIT Interest Rate Sensitivity," a report issued late last year by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. It argued that the sharp decline in REIT stock prices wasn't so much the result of rising interest rates, but was due mainly to misperceptions by investors.</br></br>The timing of the report was crucial. REIT stocks, which typically perform better than the broader stock market, had been trailing the market since May, when statements by the Federal Reserve prompted yields on Treasury bonds, along with other interest rates, to rise. NAREIT's goal was to convince investors that real-estate stocks shouldn't be viewed similarly to bonds, which tend to experience price declines when interest rates rise.</br></br>But the report also rekindled a debate among real-estate investors about the very nature of REITs, why they have performed so dismally over the past eight months and what lies ahead in 2014 if interest rates continue to rise.</br></br>"The urban myth is that there's a lock-step correlation between rising interest rates and REIT performance. There are other factors at play," says Michael Grupe, an economist with NAREIT. "REITs are clearly not [bonds]. A lot of investors may look at them that way, and make decisions based on that, but it doesn't mean they're right."
NEW YORK -- Federal Reserve policy makers voted to keep short-term interest rates unchanged, choosing to do little now to alleviate the increasingly bearish sentiments in the option market.</br></br>Option investors have adopted a more defensive posture, but traders say they have yet to see the kind of acute fear that contrarians say marks stock-market bottoms. The option market's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, edged up 0.67 point to 45.38, but remains far shy of its intraday peak of 56.74 on July 24. Meanwhile, major stock indexes are hovering near their late-July lows.</br></br>In the heavily traded options on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock Index, for instance, investors are more willing to pay up for downside protection than for bullish upside bets, traders said. They also have noticed a skew between the implied volatility of just out-of-the-money puts compared with comparable calls.</br></br>"The slope of the implied volatility skew, which measures the extra premium investors are willing to pay for out-of-the-money puts relative to out-of-the-money calls, has likewise increased" and is near its one-year high, Edward Tom, a Credit Suisse First Boston strategist, said in a report. Investors looking to increase their exposure to stocks might consider option plays like "risk reversals" -- or selling puts and buying calls on the same stock or index -- to take advantage of this skew in premiums, rather than buying stocks outright, he said.</br></br>International Business Machines' puts traded briskly as its stock slipped to another 52-week low following the downgrade of competitor Electronic Data Systems. One analyst also warned that declining returns on IBM's pension-plan assets can cut into the company's cash if the markets don't improve, while raising questions about whether Big Blue can meet year-end earnings estimates.
Author: Amy Chozick</br></br>Nothing about Donald Trump's gilded condos, private helicopters or jaunts around the golf course scream recession, but that's exactly what The Donald will focus on in the latest episode of his reality show "The Apprentice."</br></br>"Two years ago it began, an economic crisis that swept the world," Mr. Trump says in the voiceover opening of the 10th season premiere on NBC Sept. 16. This time the Mark Burnett-produced reality contest handpicked 16 contestants all hard hit by the economy.</br></br>A woman who used to be a corporate lawyer now sells cupcakes for $2 a piece out of a hot pink truck. A financial advisor laments that there's no "Plan B" if he doesn't win the prize of becoming Mr. Trump's apprentice. A man who owned a construction company had to sell his house and all his belongings when the housing went bust.</br></br>"The Apprentice" is one of the network's longest-running and best performing reality series, but ratings have sagged. Eight million viewers watched the show each week in the season that ended in May, down from 21 million in 2004, according to Nielsen Co.
The nation's unemployment rate fell slightly last month, and job growth picked up a bit, the Labor Department reported Friday, indicating that the weak labor market is continuing its slow recovery.</br></br>The unemployment rate slipped in January to 5.6 percent, the lowest level in more than two years, and non-farm businesses added 112,000 jobs, on a seasonally adjusted basis, boosting their payrolls for the fifth consecutive month.</br></br>While the movement was in the right direction, the degree of improvement was disappointing to economists and others who keep waiting for what otherwise appears to be a strong economic expansion to fuel a takeoff in hiring. And the signals of progress appeared alongside signs of continuing stress, as the average length of unemployment grew and manufacturing businesses shed 11,000 jobs, for a 42nd consecutive month of declines.</br></br>The report "displayed only minimal improvement," said Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist with Bank of America Corp. "While a healthier result than December's dismal report, it still demonstrated only very gradual job growth, with continued manufacturing payroll declines."</br></br>Many economists had forecast job gains of 175,000 or more in each of the past two months, citing rising business and consumer optimism and declines in new claims for unemployment benefits.
NEW YORK -- Labor Day is past, effectively putting the summer behind Wall Street. Ahead lies uncertainty about the economy, the anniversary of the stock market crash and a presidential election. But just how much difference will the change of seasons make to the stock market?</br></br>Not much, to hear some analysts tell it.</br></br>"The passage of Labor Day is a non-event," proclaims Michael Metz, a portfolio analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. "What the market has been telling us is that most people have no conviction and plenty of cash. It's been a trader's market, and it's going to remain a trader's market until we get some internal or external stimulus."</br></br>The best news the market could get, Mr. Metz says, would be more evidence that the Federal Reserve's credit-tightening moves are beginning to slow the economy. Last week's declines in the index of leading economic indicators and in home sales were encouraging from this point of view, he says, as was Friday's announcement of a relatively modest rise in non-farm payrolls in August.</br></br>That news sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average on a giddy rise of more than 50 points. But investors may need to be shown more. Friday's volume, after subtracting a big dividend-capture trade, was only moderate at around 150 million shares.
After paying for food and shelter, a rapidly growing number of families donï¿½Ûªt have enough left over to pay their bills, and they are turning to the bankruptcy courts for protection.</br></br>Their dilemma is reflected in a dramatic upsuxï¿½Ûªge in bankruptcy filings around the 'country. The increase, which seems to have started about the first of the year, has only now begun to atract the attention of economists and businessmen.</br></br>It is widely believed to be the first time in history that inflationï¿½ï¿½ï¿½not unemploymentï¿½ï¿½ï¿½has sparked such a rapid increase in individual insolvencies.</br></br>By filing for bankruptcy, a debtor puts his assets in the hands of a federal court. In return, he gets protection from the demands of his creditors.</br></br>In theory, the court distributes the debtorï¿½Ûªs assets among the creditors, but in the case of consumer bankruptcies this rarely happens. Most states provide various exemptions for personal belongings. In California, for example, a bankrupt can keep his car, the tools of his trade, $10,000 in equity in his home ($20,000 if he is manned) and $1,000 in a savings and loan association.
So you still have your job, but you're getting a lot less work these days.</br></br>Maybe that overtime you used to count on has disappeared. Or your boss asked you to take a few weeks of unpaid vacation. Perhaps the number of hours you put in each week has been dwindling.</br></br>Whatever the case, your paycheck is smaller, you have more time on your hands and your benefits may be at risk.</br></br>The cuts are often in lieu of -- and sometimes in addition to -- layoffs, and they may be spreading. More than half of the 200 companies surveyed in May by outplacement consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas said they had instituted salary cuts and freezes. That was double the number from January. Government data show that in June, average weekly hours for all jobs shrank 2% from a year ago.</br></br>And it's not clear when or if workplaces will ever return to normal. A June survey by consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide found that 10% of companies that imposed mandatory furloughs were not planning to get rid of them. More than half of respondents expect smaller staffs three to five years from now.
NEW YORK, March 19 (AP) ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ The Dow Jones industrial average re treated further from the 1,000 level at the stock market turned in a mixed and erratic showing yesterday.</br></br>The trend of stock prices varied widely from one industry group to another. Oil issues sold off, but savings and loan issues were strong following the recent decline in interest rates.</br></br>Some brokerage-house issues also moved up on word of Prudential Insuranceï¿½Ûªs plans to acquire Bache Group.</br></br>The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had crossed 1,000 briefly early in the week, dropped 7.48 points to 986.58.</br></br>York; Exxon was down l'/a at 68; Mobil dropped 1% to 64'/t, Superior Oil 2% to 211%, and Cities Service 4% to 42%.
The Reagan administration, in its first major statement on monetary policy, yesterday urged the Federal Reserve Board to stop paying attention to the level of interest rates and begin concentrating on one rather than several measures of the money supply. Treasury Undersecretary Beryl Sprinkle advised the Fed to allow its discount rate to vary more freely with market rates.</br></br>Sprinkel gave detailed technical advice to Fed Chairman Paul Volcker on how to achieve the steadier, slower money growth which both Reagan officials and the Fed support. The Fedï¿½Ûªs offical response yesterday was ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½no comment.ï¿½Û</br></br>Sprinkel emphasised in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee that the Fed was an independent agency, and that the administration did not want to change that. Over the last few months the Fed has done a good job of conducting monetary policy he said. But he made no bones about his view that monetary policy at times in the past has been too erratic and too centered on controlling interest rates.</br></br>He said that he had spoken to Volcker about his suggestions, but he refused to tell the committee of the chairmanï¿½Ûªs response. The Undersecretaryï¿½Ûªs testimony had been cleared with the Council of Economic advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan, Sprinkel said.</br></br>Although the administration does not expect significant progress towards lowering inflation this year, Sprinkel told the JEC, there could be a drop to single-digit inflation by the end of this year.
This yearï¿½Ûªs Federal budget deficit is now expected to run more than $24 billion, The Washington Post learned last night.</br></br>The prediction made by the President in January for fiscal 1968 (ending This June) was for a deficit of $19.8 billion.</br></br>But that contemplated $1.9 billion in additional tax revenues between April 1 and June 30 ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ a prospect that grows increasingly dim.</br></br>And in the meantime, the Government has officially boosted the Vietnam spending projection by $2.5 billion for this fiscal year. Thus, a high official said last night, the deficit could run to $24.2 billion, unless the 10 per cent surtax bill is passed and made retroactive to April 1.</br></br>ï¿½Û¢ The possibility of such a huge deficitï¿½ï¿½ï¿½which officials fear could cause new international concern about the dollarï¿½ï¿½ï¿½is also indicated in the cumulated spending and receipts figures for the first 8 months of the fiscal year.
There is a strong and growing perception in official Washington that (one way or another) this Congress will raise excise taxes, especially gasoline and possibly estate taxes, in order to help reduce the federal budget deficit. The unanswered question is whether Ronald Reagan will swallow hard and agree.</br></br>As he did again just before going to the economic summit in Venice, Reagan periodically swears a blood oath that any tax increase will be signed over his dead body. But this shouldn't be taken literally: examined carefully, it can be seen that Reaganï¿½Ûªs ire is directed at higher tax rates, which means that heï¿½Ûªs against new taxes on personal or business income.</br></br>In fact, the administration has already opened the door to some revenue increases with its own budget proposal for excise taxes disguised as user fees, as well as payroll and other levies.</br></br>Says a high administration official privately: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Anybody who says that weï¿½Ûªre not proposing to raise $3.7 billion in new taxes is smoking dope!ï¿½Û</br></br>Those excise taxes are exactly what the other ideologue in this drama. House Speaker James Wright (D-Tex.), opposes with almost a religious fervor. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Jim regards excises as a way of taxing Joe Six-Pack,ï¿½Û a colleague says.
Housing construction remained strong last month, the government said yesterday, but interest rates have soared dramatically since, and builders are bracing for a sharp slowdown in 1979.</br></br>New construction of homes and apartments was at an annual rate of 2.08 million units in Octoberï¿½ï¿½ï¿½virtually unchanged from September, the Commerce Department said. It was the eighth consecutive month that starts have been above the 2 million mark, a level economists consider to be healthy.</br></br>However, building permits, which indicate future housing construction, fell 2.9 percent, the department said.</br></br>ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½We believe that starts should finish the year at nearly 2 million, which is great,ï¿½Û said Michael Sumichrast, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½But next year will tell a different tale, and starts should fall to about 1.5 million.ï¿½Û</br></br>The government has issued slightly more optimistic estimates, saying starts will fall to between 1.65 and 1.7 million in 1979.
NEW YORK--Oil futures finished slightly higher, after signs of progress in Europe's debt crisis vaulted markets into positive territory late in the day.</br></br>The higher close capped a day of volatile trading. Oil prices spent much of the day lower, gripped by fears about the weak global economic recovery, but an afternoon rally in the equities market was enough for crude futures to eke out gains.</br></br>Some market participants said it was among the most turbulent trading days in recent memory.</br></br>"It's been very brutal," said Tony Rosado, a broker at GA Global Markets in New York. "You have to have extremely deep pockets to trade this market."</br></br>Light, sweet crude for September delivery rose 25 cents, or 0.3%, to settle at $86.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract sank to an intraday low of $82.87 a barrel, its lowest since Nov. 26, before ending the day higher.
ADEAR ALTA: That's the shortest real estate question -- and one of the best -- I have ever received. I wish the answer could be so brief.</br></br>An "as is" real estate sale means the seller will not pay for any property repairs but must disclose all known defects.</br></br>Many sellers of older homes sell "as is" because they don't want to be inconvenienced with repairs or renovations, realize the buyers may want to tear down the house or remodel to their own preferences, and/or can't afford to make repairs.</br></br>Personally, I learned about "as is" home sales after I bought a foreclosure house from a bank. The realty agent marketing the residence emphasized that the sale was "as is" and that the bank wouldn't pay for any repairs. But the price was such a bargain that I was blindsided and failed to notice all the items that needed repair or replacement. Fortunately, I had plans to renovate the property, so it really didn't matter, and I eventually resold that property at a substantial profit.</br></br>Sellers of "as is" houses should realize that it is a red-flag warning to buyers, who usually expect a sales price discount from full-market value to compensate for the needed repairs. Buyers of "as is" houses can often obtain bargain purchase prices, but they should always make their purchase offer contingent on approval of a professional inspection report.
Washington, which gave birth to telecommunications competition 25 years ago, is now leading that industry toward its Darwinian climax.</br></br>A ruthless restructuring has moved into its final phase in the past 10 days as three local telecom companies threw in the towel, starting what is projected to be the biggest industry implosion since real estate developers took down the savings and loan industry a decade ago.</br></br>E.spire Communications Inc. of Herndon has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Metrocall Inc. of Alexandria says it may have to do the same. PSINet Inc. of Ashburn is trying to avoid it, but isn't given much chance by industry insiders. More local companies are lined up behind them.</br></br>Each of these companies was set up to serve a different piece of the telecommunications market. E.spire was into local and long- distance voice. Metrocall sold wireless paging. PSINet's specialty was high-speed Internet services. Stockholders of this trio of companies have seen $14 billion in stock market value wiped out. Investors stuck with $5 billion worth of high-risk, high-yield "junk bonds" issued by the companies are expected to collect only pennies on the dollar for their debts.</br></br>These are the first victims of an epidemic that by some estimates could wipe out more than a thousand telecommunications providers in the next few years.
From the commercial bustle of Shanghai to the renowned natural beauty of this city, President Clinton devoted two of the closing days of his China tour to a campaign aimed at persuading the Chinese that robust economic growth does not have to come at the expense of their country's fragile environment.</br></br>Clinton spent Wednesday touting China's recent moves toward market economics, including a tour of the Shanghai stock market and a luncheon with young entrepreneurs. But his generally ebullient remarks were tempered by a dire warning about the damaging effects that China's industrialization is having on air, water, and food quality.</br></br>Clinton continued to develop his environmental theme here in Guilin, where the Li River and the unusual limestone formations that jut up out of the valley floor create a striking natural tableau that has been memorialized for centuries in Chinese art.</br></br>Cooling himself in sweltering heat with a colorful Chinese fan -- he called it "an energy-efficient air conditioner" -- Clinton told Guilin residents today: "China has a unique opportunity, because you are developing rapidly but later in time than other countries, to avoid making the same mistakes we have made."</br></br>In the speech, Clinton announced a number of initiatives that will provide U.S. assistance to an incipient Chinese anti-pollution movement.
Dianne Feinstein, fresh in from the California gubernatorial race for last night's big summer Democratic fund-raising dinner, was chatting with reporters about how the budget deficit has caused Americans "to start to realize that the Republicans aren't the panacea," when up rushed Rep. Beryl Anthony Jr. (Ark.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</br></br>He was delighted that Feinstein was there in the great hall of the National Building Museum downtown-a bright spot in an otherwise somewhat low-key, business-suited crowd of roughly 700 overheated politicians, lobbyists and party loyalists-and immediately took her in tow to introduce her around. "She'll be the next governor of California," said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (Wash.), after the two had talked animatedly at a reception before the dinner.</br></br>In his dinner speech, former Democratic National Committee chairman Charles T. Manatt noted that the former San Francisco mayor likes it pronounced Fein-STINE, not STEEN, and had once, when visiting New York Mayor Ed Koch persisted in mispronouncing it, warned him in public that she might begin mispronouncing his name in a way that would raise high the roof beams.</br></br>That was the evening's only joke, unless you counted Foley's observation concerning the menu (herb-roasted flank steak, cold lobster and "medley of blanched and chilled vegetables") that "I'm not the veggie type."</br></br>What is it with the Democrats? At last year's summer party-the first ever-they had the hull of a sinking ship in the middle of the room, for reasons that never were completely made clear.
HONG KONG--A surprise profit warning by a meat processor and news of market-misconduct proceedings against a vegetable producer have put listed Chinese companies once again under the corporate-governance spotlight.</br></br>China Yurun Food Group Ltd.'s warning Monday that its third-quarter net profit will be down--in part due to negative publicity involving tainted pork--sent the company's shares tumbling 31% to 7.51 Hong Kong dollars (96 U.S. cents), the lowest close in nearly three years. Also Monday, the Hong Kong government confirmed proceedings against Chaoda Modern Agriculture (Holdings) Ltd. in the Market Misconduct Tribunal, sending its shares down 27% to HK$1.10 before a midafternoon trading suspension.</br></br>Chaoda Modern, which grows and processes fruits and vegetables in China, said trading was suspended ahead of the release of price-sensitive information from the company. It didn't elaborate, and declined comment Monday.</br></br>The charges against Chaoda Modern weren't specified. The tribunal handles civil cases on matters such as insider trading, false trading, price rigging and stock-market manipulation against companies and directors regulated under Hong Kong securities laws.</br></br>Since June, a number of overseas-listed Chinese businesses have faced intense media and investor scrutiny over accounting practices and allegations of impropriety, with trading in several stocks listed in the U.S., Canada and Hong Kong still suspended. Shares in many other listed Chinese companies fell sharply as investors dumped what they considered increasingly risky investments.
NEW YORK (AP) - The stock market finished its first declining week of the new year Friday with another substantial loss at the hands of profit takers.</br></br>Losers outnumbered gainers l>y about a 2-1 margin in the daily tally of New York Slock exc hange-listed issues.</br></br>vulnerable to a setback, They said investors, holding stocks with big paper profits, are likely in such an environment to do some precuationary profit taking on any unsettling news.</br></br>The catalyst that seemed to let loose some of that built-up selling pressure was the Houseï¿½Ûªs rejection late Thursday of a bill to remove price controls from natural gassoldinterstate.</br></br>Hopes that Ihe House would pass the measure sparked a sharp runup in many energy stocks earlier in the week.
Everyone knows what happens to a fool and his fortune. In John Rothchild's case, however, the process was particularly brutal.</br></br>He dove into the financial markets with $16,500 and casual dreams of being wealthy. Eighteen months later, the Dow had soared, but Rothchild's original stake had been shaved all the way down to $800. He couldn't have lost much more if he'd been trying.</br></br>This neat trick wasn't accomplished solo. Rothchild sought help from stockbrokers, commodities traders, interest-rates guru Henry Kaufman, risk arbitrageurs, short-sellers, financial planners, stock analysts and the trash cans of insider trading whiz Ivan Boesky. Almost always, Rothchild found his advisers as befuddled as himself. And if they didn't think that, they were soon confounded anyway.</br></br>"People say the market's this or the market's that, and they begin to think they can understand it," a corn trader on the Chicago Board of Trade told Rothchild. "They discover they're wrong. They can't understand it. The market is ... the market is God."</br></br>Don't feel too bad for Rothchild, though. At least he gained a book out of his ordeal. (It's called, of course, A Fool and His Money.) Subtitled The Odyssey of an Average Investor, the book seeks to demystify the experts by pointing out the pitfalls of investing in general and mindless investing in particular. It's an idea that's getting a sympathetic reception in the wake of the market's October plunge.
The stock market tried to push its rally into a fourth session yesterday but finished with mixed results in slower but still active trading of nearly 92 million shares.</br></br>Blue-chip and technology issues, which had been leaders earlier in the week, mostly retreated and were joined by the chemical, retail, auto and some of the oil, airline and drug stocks.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, up a total 17.49 points in the prior three days, showed a slight gain after yesterday's first half hour but by 1:30 p.m. EDT was down 6.28 points. The index halved its loss in the next hour but then fell, closing at 1181.53, down 5.03 points. The transportation indicator also lost ground, but the utility average rose.</br></br>New York Stock Exchange gainers managed to nose out the losers 793 to 783.</br></br>"The stock market is still bothered somewhat by interest rates," asserted Edward P. Nicoski, first vice president at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis. Yesterday several key interest rates moved up slightly. After the close, the Federal Reserve reported that for the week ended April 23 the nation's basic money supply fell $3.6 billion. That was a somewhat greater drop than expected and thus could slightly ease upward pressures on interest rates. But analysts continue to fret over the size of the Treasury's planned securities offerings and signs of continued vigorous economic growth.
BOSTONï¿½ï¿½ï¿½For the past five years I have celebrated Aug. 26, the anniversary of the passage of womenï¿½Ûªs suffrage, in my own kinky way. I have handed out awards to people for notable achievements in their fight against equality, harmony, peace and justice between the sexes.</br></br>Until now, I have called this the Annual Life Isnï¿½Ûªt Fair Awards. This year, however, in commemoration of the defeat of the ERA, I have decided to rename this event. Henceforth, by popular demand, these coveted prizes will be known as the Equal Rites Awards. But enough of all this chatter when you are waiting breathlessly for the results.</br></br>The first award always goes, by protocol, to the president of the United States, a man who* believes in the E and the R but not the A. To him, for reasons too numerous to list, we send a hard-earned satin scarlet ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Aï¿½Û for Affirmative re-Action.</br></br>But in all fairness, he must give up the Pig-male-ion of the Year Award, to be shared by those dozen state legislators in Florida, Illinois and North Carolina who defeated ERA, proving again that a majority does not always rule. To them, we send individual ballot boxes . . . empty.</br></br>The Knight in Shining Armor Prize for gallantry this year goes to another president, J. Terryl Bechtol of the Jaycees, who is purging his organization of the women members it had previously wooed. This award is inscribed with his chivalrous remark at a Jaycee meeting: ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Would the woman please leave. I canï¿½Ûªt teach leadership to a woman.ï¿½Û
If you picked `c' you are right. One of the oddities of investing is that as the price of a stock goes down, the yield on the stock gets better.</br></br>For example, if Zilch Power & Light Co. pays a $1 a year dividend, and the stock sells for $25, you are getting a yield of 4 percent. But let the stock sink to $12.50 a share and you are getting an 8 percent yield.</br></br>Now, an 8 percent yield looks pretty good these days and, indeed, so does any stock that is selling for half the price of only 11 months ago. Thus, a lot of investors must be looking at the recent carnage in utility stocks and utility funds and wondering if it is time to go bargain hunting.</br></br>Unfortunately, there's no easy answer. Electric utility stocks, once safe, dependable and boring, have become hotbeds of turmoil and uncertainty. Their sensitivity to changes in interest rates is only part of the story.</br></br>Vast changes are taking place in the electricity business and the utilities, which once enjoyed a monopoly status, apparently will be forced to compete for business in a free-wheeling competitive environment that could hurt the value of their generating plants, their companies and their stock prices.
WASHINGTON -- At a time the Internal Revenue Service is under pressure to step up tax collection efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit, a "taxpayer bill of rights" that would give taxpayers new protections from the IRS is moving in Congress.</br></br>The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved taxpayer-rights legislation Friday, and the full Senate is expected to pass it. But the measure could face obstacles: There is some opposition from the IRS and the House Ways and Means Committee to any significant restrictions on the agency's ability to collect taxes.</br></br>"The bill is not an attempt to bash the IRS . . . but to protect taxpayers from heavy-handed abuse," said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas), chairman of the Finance Committee.</br></br>The legislation would require the IRS to notify taxpayers in writing of their rights before questioning or auditing them. It would allow taxpayers to sue to recover damages if the IRS proceeds in an unreasonable collection action, and to recover legal fees if they win -- unless the agency could prove that it had "substantial justification" for bringing the case.</br></br>The measure also would extend to 30 days, from 10 days, the written notice that the IRS must give taxpayers before seizing property. And it would require the IRS to waive penalties for taxpayers who don't pay enough taxes as a result of erroneous written IRS advice.
